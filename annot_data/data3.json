The city blew past the latter number in late October. Average daily cases are now closing in on 2,000.\n\nIn another bad sign, 174 patients were recently admitted to hospitals for COVID-19 or flu-like symptoms. The warning marker for that indicator is 200.\n\n\"What we are now seeing more than we have seen in a long long time unfortunately is these three indicators moving in the wrong direction,\" the mayor said during his morning press conference. \"It\u2019s quite clear at this point that this second wave is right upon us.\"\n\nGovernor Andrew Cuomo has ordered hospitals to draw up emergency plans and expand capacity. While he also expressed concern, de Blasio said hospitals were nonetheless better equipped to handle a surge of patients than they were in the spring.\n\nThis week, city officials began urging New Yorkers over 65 and those with underlying conditions to stay at home.\n\nHealth experts are bracing for the worst across the country.\n\nDr. Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Wednesday that the winter months could be \u201cthe most difficult in the public health history of this nation.\"\n\nSpeaking at a U.S. Chamber of Commerce event, he said deaths had been rising. The country is now recording between 1,500 and 2,500 deaths everyday.\n\nHe said total fatalities, which are now around 272,000, could approach 450,000 before February.\n\nAlthough the first vaccines are expected to arrive in the next few weeks, Redfield warned that precautionary measures would still be necessary for many months and predicted that large gatherings would not officially resume until the fall of 2021.", "title": "Coronavirus Updates: New York City's Virus Positivity Rate Hits Highest Level In 6 Months", "dataset": "['manual_google_by_location']", "labels": "['health', 'public_space']", "annot_city": "['New York']"}, {"id": 8710, "city": null, "url": "https://nypost.com/2020/12/03/nycs-homeless-student-population-could-soon-skyrocket/", "text": "Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe city\u2019s homeless student population dipped slightly last year \u2014 but advocates warn that the numbers may be skewed due to the coronavirus and could soon skyrocket.\n\nAccording to Advocates for Children of New York, 111,000 children were identified as homeless during the 2019-2020 academic year \u2014 a dip of 2.2 percent from the prior term.\n\nOf those, about 32,700 lived in homeless shelters while roughly 73,000 were \u201cdoubled up\u201d in temporary housing situations with friends or family, according to ACNY.\n\nIn the Bronx, 1 in 6 students were homeless last year, the organization reported, citing state data. The city\u2019s homeless students are 85 percent African American and Hispanic, they added.\n\nACNY cautioned that the slight decrease could be attributable to the difficulty in tracking homeless kids because of technology gaps or lack of Department of Education contact with families.\n\n\u201cThe vast scale of student homelessness in New York City demands urgent attention,\u201d said Kim Sweet, executive director of Advocates for Children.\n\nSweet warned that the city\u2019s already staggering number of homeless students \u2014 which is higher than the entire public school population of Vermont \u2014 is likely to worsen.\n\nThe impact of the coronavirus on the city\u2019s economy is likely to exacerbate homelessness \u2014 especially when eviction moratoriums are lifted, she said.\n\n\u201cThe City must act now to put more support in place for students who are homeless,\u201d Sweet said.\n\nThe organization stressed that the damage wrought by youth homelessness is being magnified this year due to the introduction of remote learning.\n\nMany kids in shelters do not have reliable devices or Wi-Fi availability and are struggling badly as a result, the group said.\n\nFor homeless kids, remote learning \u201cmay mean trying to complete assignments on a smartphone in the middle of a noisy and overcrowded room,\u201d ACNY said.\n\nThe group urged the Department of Education and City Hall to improve its provision of technology and to use attendance data to target kids who are slipping out of sight.\n\nThe DOE should also prioritize homeless students for full-time classroom instruction when possible, ACNY said.\n\n\u201cLearning from home is much harder when you don\u2019t have a permanent home,\u201d Sweet said.", "title": "NYC\u2019s homeless student population could skyrocket due to COVID-19", "dataset": "['manual_google_by_location']", "labels": "['homelessness']", "annot_city": "['New York']"}, {"id": 8711, "city": null, "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/03/insider/coronavirus-queens-reporting.html", "text": "Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.\n\nMore than 600 miles of subway tracks carve through the streets of New York City, but the 7 train, which runs along Queens\u2019s bustling Roosevelt Avenue, glides above perhaps the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world.\n\nHundreds of thousands of New Yorkers live between the line\u2019s 69th Street to 103rd Street stops, which serve five neighborhoods \u2014 Corona, East Elmhurst, Elmhurst, Jackson Heights and Woodside.

And many of those remaining now face the prospect of having to pay a higher minimum wage as of Jan. 1 \u2014 which will likely kill more jobs.\n\nBut Gov. Andrew Cuomo can delay it.\n\n\u201cThe last thing New York\u2019s economy needs is a state-mandated disincentive to put people back to work,\u201d notes the Empire Center\u2019s E.J. McMahon. This sure isn\u2019t the economic climate that lawmakers expected.\n\nThe minimum hourly wage, already $15 in the city, is to rise from $13 to $14 (7.7 percent) in Long Island and Westchester, and from $11.80 to $12.50 (5.9 percent) in the rest of the state. That\u2019s bigger than most employers\u2019 profit margins.\n\nAs McMahon points out, the state Division of the Budget can recommend a \u201ctemporary suspension or delay\u201d of the hikes based on an analysis of regional economies.

Then he watched the animated musical series \"Central Park,\" and New York City started to become a major theme in their Ohio household.\n\nThe family of three stayed home most of the year, except for a trip to Arkansas for a family funeral. But with Martin and his wife\u2019s anniversary in July and his wife\u2019s birthday in September, they decided they could swing a short fall trip to celebrate the occasions without their son missing too much school.\n\n\u201cWe were like, \u2018Why don't we just go to New York?\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then we were, like, \u2018Well why would we go to New York? There's nothing to do in New York.\u2019 But we looked around and there were still lots of things to do.\u201d\n\nOne of those things was Broadway Up Close, a tour of Broadway\u2019s theaters detailing the history and inner workings of everything it takes to put on a big show.\n\nTim Dolan, the founder of Broadway Up Close, has been bustling harder than he has since he founded the company in 2010, he said. His tour company and gift shop rely on tourists attending New York City\u2019s theaters. And in 2020, that\u2019s not happening.\n\nOn March 12, all 41 of New York City\u2019s theaters closed their doors. They\u2019re not expected to open back up until June 1, 2021 and, even then, there\u2019s still uncertainty around which theaters will open at that time. With the reopening date pushed back multiple times thus far, many people in the industry think the reopening is more likely to take place closer to September of 2021.\n\nThis means that people who work in the tourism industry, like Dolan, have had to completely revamp the way their businesses operate in order to stay afloat.\n\nIn 2019, NYC tourism hit a record high\u201466.6 million individual trips with about $47.4 billion generated in direct spending for the city, according to the 2019 NYC & Company annual report. But by the end of 2020, tourism is expected to drop by about 66% to 22.9 million visitors, according to NYC & Co. It\u2019s not expected to reach pre-pandemic numbers until 2025.\n\nBefore COVID-19 hit, the majority of Dolan\u2019s profits came from the six in-person tours his company offered. Five of these were walking exterior theater tours and one tour included a visit inside the Hudson Theater.\n\n\u201cWhen the shutdown started, I refunded more money than I've ever refunded in my entire life,\u201d Dolan said. \u201cYou feel the life slipping through your fingers.\u201d\n\nDolan, an actor by trade, started his company understanding that working in the industry often means relying on an unpredictable stream of income. It\u2019s why most of his staff are young actors themselves. But when COVID-19 hit, he had to furlough his 22 employees. Now the business operates with a staff of two\u2014Dolan and a graphic designer who freelances for him.\n\nIn April 2019, he opened a brick and mortar shop across the street from the Minskoff Theatre, home to \"The Lion King\" musical. In the shop, people could buy typical Broadway-themed souvenirs, like t-shirts, hoodies, tote bags and keychains. He\u2019s been able to hold on to the store despite its closed doors with support from the Times Square Alliance, the site's owner.\n\nNot only did he take the entire gift shop online for the first time, but he also had to reimagine the type of merchandise he could sell. Most people aren\u2019t interested in buying souvenirs for trips they haven\u2019t taken.\n\n\u201cWe have no tourists. We have no Broadway shows. We're not making any new New York memories or theater memories, specifically,\u201d Dolan said, describing his thought process. \u201cLet's cherish the ones that we've already created.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when he came up with the idea to do custom ticket stub souvenirs. Customers can input information from a ticket stub, like the name of the theater, the date and time, cost, and seat number, and Dolan creates an engraved ticket stub made of cherry wood.\n\n\u201cI'm making all of that literally in my apartment,\u201d he said about the new types of merchandise he\u2019s selling, including handmade wooden picture frames and ornaments. \u201cOther than a tote bag, a t-shirt, and a magnet, I thought, \u2018What else can we do to change the merchandise game while we have this moment of time that I might not have had otherwise?\u2019\u201d\n\nNow it\u2019s this virtual gift shop that\u2019s keeping his business afloat.\n\nBut tours are still happening.\n\nAfter taking some time to deal with those massive refunds at the onset of the pandemic, he decided he wanted to take his tours online. He started by putting videos on his company\u2019s Instagram account. Then Playbill reached out to collaborate to do Zoom-hosted tours. It then evolved to Dolan doing his own virtual tours.\n\n\u201cWe've garnered people from all over the world,\u201d he said. \u201cI just did one yesterday, and she was like, \u2018It\u2019s 4 a.m. here in Australia. Thanks for keeping me awake.\u2019 I didn\u2019t realize that.\u201d\n\nAfter Gov. Andrew Cuomo gave the green light for small in-person gatherings, he eventually began hosting walking tours again.\n\nHis company used to do about 10 to 14 tours a week. That number\u2019s gone down to about one to three a week. And with out-of-state tourism down drastically, the clients he serves are almost all locals.\n\n\u201cI just kind of put it out there,\u201d Dolan said. \u201cFor any New Yorkers who are bored in their studio apartments and want to get out for a minute\u2014it's totally safe. Let's hang out in Times Square. There's no one here.\u201d\n\nBut locals aren\u2019t the only customers he takes on his in-person tours.\n\nEvery so often he gets out-of-towners like the Blaine family from Ohio, who visited at the end of September for four days. Currently, the quarantine guidelines for people arriving from out-of-state require people to get tested within three days of leaving for New York and after three days of quarantining in the city. If they test negative both times, they can bypass the 14-day quarantine. Even with an option for a three-day quarantine, this can make tourism difficult for people like the Blaines who did not quarantine on their brief trip.\n\nThe family figured that they\u2019d keep the trip fairly simple\u2014walk around, relax, and check out Central Park for the few days they were in town. But Martin, his wife, and son were surprised at how full of an experience they were able to have.\n\n\u201cFor the month after we left, my son kept saying \u2018I'm going to move to New York when I get older,\u2019\u201d Blaine said over the phone in November.\n\nOther than the huge crowds, sporting events and Broadway shows, the Blaine family was able to see and do most of what they would want to do on a normal New York City vacation, including the Broadway Up Close tour.\n\n\u201cI showed up expecting there to be people,\u201d Blaine said. \u201cI figured that [Dolan] wouldn't just run this thing for the three of us, but yeah, it was just the three of us. It was really great. And it was even better because it was like we paid the regular price for a private tour.\u201d\n\nThe Blaines aren\u2019t the only ones who think New York is still worth visiting this year.\n\nWhile the ferry station to Liberty Island is nowhere near the level of bustling it was pre-pandemic, tourists are still lining up to see the Statue of Liberty.\n\nJannyna and Katy Morillo came to New York City from Quito, Ecuador and stayed with Jannyna\u2019s uncle in the Bronx. It was Katy\u2019s first time seeing the city.\n\n\u201cI already know everything in the city, but for her [this is a first],\u201d Jannyna said in Spanish. \u201cWe went to the Empire State Building, Madame Tussauds, and now the Statue of Liberty. This weekend we are having a family reunion for my uncle\u2019s birthday.\u201d\n\nThere were other groups of friends who traveled to the city as well, including a group from Texas.\n\n\u201cI would definitely come back,\u201d said Gabby, 25. \u201cI want to see more of the parks\u2014it's really beautiful.\u201d\n\nThat was the refrain from many tourists we spoke to who have recently visited New York City\u2014that it was such a great experience it only affirmed their resolve to come back.\n\nAnd that\u2019s what is keeping Dolan\u2019s spirits up and helping him concoct new ways to provide meaningful products and experiences for people who want to appreciate the city.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just about finding any way we can cherish this incredible city that is hurting really badly and our industry that's hurting really badly,\u201d he said. \u201cHow do you embrace all of that, and cherish that until the lights turn back on?\u201d", "title": "This Is What Tourism Looks Like In NYC Right Now", "dataset": "['manual_google_by_location']", "labels": "['tourism']", "annot_city": "['New York']"}, {"id": 8716, "city": null, "url": "https://guestofaguest.com/new-york/nyc/fifth-avenue-holiday-lights", "text": "'Tis the season...\n\nThough the holidays may look a tad bit different this year, the Fifth Avenue Association is making New York merry and bright, installing a series of brilliantly festive, larger-than-life classic toy sculptures along the Avenue for all to enjoy!\n\nStretching from 50th Street to 59th Street, the \"Make It Bright\" holiday spectacular features ten show-stopping light installations created by Blachere Illumination, whose work has previously lit up the Champs \u00c9lys\u00e9es and the Eiffel Tower - so you know it's going to be tr\u00e8s chic!\n\nExpect to be wowed by the art pieces which range from five to eight feet tall and feature everything from a classic New York City taxicab and a giant teddy bear to an old fashioned Christmas tree delivery truck, a life-sized dreidel, a snowman pilot and more!\n\nLooking to plan this must-see holiday experience like a pro?

We recently began this recruitment campaign in anticipation of a potential second wave,\u201d Hinck said.\n\nJamaica hospital currently has fewer than 30 COVID patients as opposed to approximately 300 hospitalized patients at the peak in early-mid April, he said.\n\n\n\n\u201cBecause our hospital was located at the epicenter during the emergence of the pandemic we were fortunate to receive volunteer doctors and nurses from across the country. We are uncertain if we would receive the same level of assistance now as the virus is greatly affecting the entire nation,\u201d Hinck said.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile the New York City Medical Reserve Corps \u2014 run by the Health Department \u2014 currently has over 13,000 medical volunteers at the ready to staff city hospitals for another outbreak. The reserve corps has not received staffing requests from hospitals \u201cbut they are ready to deploy volunteers for surge staffing if necessary,\u201d said Health Department spokeswoman Julia Morrill.\n\nMoreover Northwell Health, the state\u2019s largest private medical provider, said it has a reserve of 7,500 retired doctors, nurses and other clinicians at the ready to pitch in during a surge at its 23 regional hospitals, said spokesman Joe Kemp.

Colder yesterday in New York; in the low 40s and then dropping mid-evening into the 30s with a RealFeel of 29 degrees: very cold.\n\nThe Beautiful Jean. I had dinner on Tuesday night with Mary Hilliard, one of our favorite photographers who\u2019s been covering New Yorkers \u2014 here and abroad as well as in Palm Beach. In conversation about her business we wandered through personal association to Jean Howard, a major beauty of mid-20th century in Hollywood, New York and across the sea. Later on in the evening, after dinner, Mary sent me this photograph she took of Jean in 1989 at Mortimer\u2019s restaurant with its owner Glenn Birnbaum and Lauren Bacall. It was a party for the publication of Jean\u2019s first book of photographs, a photographic memoir, \u201cJean Howard\u2019s Hollywood.\u201d\n\nThe title was apt in the sense that the little girl born Ernestine Mahoney in Fort Worth, Texas in 1910, who went on to become, in her uniquely quiet way, one of the most celebrated beauties (and personalities) in her world \u2013 in her time. I never heard the details of her childhood, but her father was a traveling salesman, her mother had a serious drug addiction \u2014 it may have been morphine; this was in the second decade of the 20th century \u2014 dying when Jean was still very young.\n\nWhen she was old enough, because of her mother\u2019s condition, her father often took his daughter on his trips to the big cities, and especially New York. The bright lights caught the young girl\u2019s imagination, and as fate had it, when she was 21 she was hired by Florenz Ziegfeld to appear in his 1931 Ziegfeld Follies. It was the last of the Follies, which lost its dazzle with the Depression. But it was the beginning of a brilliant career/life in the world that was just unfolding for everyone, and for now Jean Howard.\n\nI don\u2019t know where Louis B. Mayer first met or spotted her \u2014 very possibly while attending a performance of the Follies. It was easy for him to be introduced to her. Now a successful mogul in his late 40s, and shining with stature with his own Studio, Mayer had begun cheating on his wife Margaret, mother of his two daughters, Edie Goetz and Irene Selznick. He was looking to return to his own youth with such a beauty by his side.\n\nJean, however, did respond to his wishes to have her tested for a studio contract. She accompanied him to events and even traveled to Paris with him, although at her insistence chaperoned by a slightly older friend. She was not interested in being his wife or girlfriend. The frustrated Mayer threatened to kill himself by jumping from their hotel window if she didn\u2019t marry him. Jean and her friend were on the first ocean liner back to New York.\n\nIt was about the same time she met a young, handsome and successful talent agent named Charles Feldman. He spotted her one night at a nightclub in the Beverly Wilshire Hotel and sent a note to her the following morning asking if he could see her the following evening to discuss a very important matter. I don\u2019t know Jean\u2019s side of the story, but she agreed.\n\nYou could tell by the note he sent her, knowing the after story, that he was flummoxed on the sight of her. She was a great natural beauty, with charisma suggesting that it was total. I had first read about her in a Cole Porter biography published in the early \u201960s and I first met her in 1978 at a small dinner at the home of Merle Oberon and Rob Wolders in the Malibu Colony. It was like walking into film history for this writer.\n\nThe guests were William (Willie) Wyler and his wife Tally, Luis Estevez, the fashion designer, and a close friend of Merle\u2019s who was an old friend of mine and had arranged for my presence \u2014 knowing my curiosity \u2014 and Jean Howard and her second husband Tony Santoro, a guitarist she met when she heard him in a small caf\u00e9 on the island of Capri where she was often a guest of Mona Bismarck.\n\nThe story of their meeting in that caf\u00e9 is classic. Tony was a very nice, soft spoken man, about fifteen or maybe twenty years her junior. When she told me the story of the night, she was with two gentlemen friends of hers, rich Americans of middle age both of whom had their eye on the guitarist. They even flipped a coin over him. Invited to their table after a set, Jean and Tony were at the right place at the right time. They returned to Beverly Hills together and remained in residence to the end of her life.\n\nI don\u2019t know much about Jean\u2019s professional career. I knew her because of her association with Cole Porter, and that she was married to Charlie Feldman who owned the Ashley-Famous Agency and produced the first Woody Allen film. Meeting her that night at Merle\u2019s was fascinating to me because there was a natural serenity in her presence and her beauty was outshone by her presence. She was open and curious, but warm and friendly, and you had the feeling that she was always like this. It was a subtle charm.\n\nAs I got to know her throughout the \u201870s and \u201880s, I was in her thrall. She had the sophistication of her environment and the ole Texas girl quiet razz-ma-tazz right underneath \u2014 while maybe slipping in an interesting and sharp insight about a personality she was describing. And there was that easy gentle, quiet laugh that came out of that smile. She lived in a wonderful hacienda style house at 2000 Coldwater Canyon which she and Charlie Feldman bought in 1935. When I knew her the house had been long ago decorated by Elsie De Wolfe/Lady Mendl, who during the Second World War had returned from Europe to the U.S and settled in house just down the road from the Feldmans. She gave the Feldman hacienda style and the California classic feeling; quietly comfortable.\n\nThat was when Beverly Hills was mainly countryside and 2000 Coldwater was one of the few houses in the area. After they divorced, Jean and Charlie shared use of the residence six months each until he finally, having remarried, gave it to her.\n\nThere was a black baby grand in one corner of the music gallery overlooking the courtyard. On it was a single silver framed portrait of Cole Porter with the handwritten inscription: To the beautiful Jean\u201d and signed \u201cLove Cole\u201d.\n\nJean later was heir to several bequests in Cole\u2019s will. His wife Linda left her collection of jewels to Jean as well as other items of furniture that fit in to Lady Mendl design. Nights at Jean\u2019s dinners often ended around the piano with the local talent (Judy Garland, Richard Burton, Sammy Davis, and many others over the years). It was relaxed but it was, in keeping with the fashion of the times in Hollywood, long dresses, suit and tie, maybe black tie at times.\n\nThere was one such dinner party on the night of July 13, 1960 when John F. Kennedy was nominated for the Presidency downtown at the LA Memorial Coliseum. Jean\u2019s guests were celebrating his nomination, and her guests had finally gone home long after midnight when the nominee himself arrived at a side door of the rambling hacienda, solo, and happy to be there.\n\nShe took up photography sometime in the late \u201940s or early \u201850s. It was out of interest, but not from the point of view as a hobby. She was trained by a female photographer well known in the community. Jean lived and worked around professionals all her life.\n\nThe objective was to Be Your Best to your audience. This was assumed in all her work. Her book \u201cJean Howard\u2019s Hollywood\u201d is now a classic, a piece of art in the sense that her photographs reflect the feeling I\u2019ve described about being around her. She clearly made a life for herself as a hostess. And it had a quiet glamour that was Hollywood \u2014 a name in that age for one of the most glamorous places in the world \u2013 and she was a great hostess. Everyone felt comfortable in her presence. It came with her personality.\n\nLooking at Mary\u2019s photo of Jean taken at the book party in Mortimer\u2019s with Glenn Birnbaum and Lauren Bacall (who is photographed with Humphrey Bogart in the book) taken in the early days of their marriage, I was looking at a much older Jean than I had seen in the days I had got to know her. But the face, which looks so perfect, was the same face, and the perfection \u2014 perhaps assisted later in her life \u2014 was the same. It was in the eyes, the way she looked at you in conversation, the eyes on you; that was the charisma.\n\nShe was in her 79th year in that photograph of Mary\u2019s. I was reminded how a few years before she had told me that she was proud of the fact that as she was getting older she had been honest about her age. But by 78, she wished she\u2019d cut a few years off much earlier, thinking maybe that would even return herself to that energy and perception. She died shortly before her 90th in 2000.", "title": "When Hollywood glamour takes on New York", "dataset": "['manual_google_by_location']", "labels": "['entertainment', 'indirect_city_relation']", "annot_city": "['New York']"}, {"id": 8720, "city": null, "url": "https://abc7ny.com/ryan-wilson-inmate-suicide-the-tombs-manhattan-detention-complex/8475173/", "text": "LOWER MANHATTAN (WABC) -- Family and supporters of Ryan Wilson, a man who killed himself in a New York City prison, demanded justice after they say he was left without supervision despite a history of mental health issues.The family held a briefing outside Manhattan Detention Complex, known informally as \"The Tombs,\" Thursday.That's where the 29-year-old Wilson was being held on November 22 when he died by suicide in his cell.\"It's not supposed to be a tomb, it's supposed to be a jail.

During the campaign, President-Elect Biden proposed a $2 trillion infrastructure plan to boost the economy and tackle climate change. He also called for the creation of a Civilian Climate Corps that would work on resilience and restoration projects, modeled after the New Deal-era Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). The deep economic pain being felt across the country may also create broad political support for a major infrastructure bill to get Americans back to work.\n\nNew York City should prepare to seize this opportunity. Few other American cities would benefit more from a public works initiative to create jobs. Through September, New York City had lost roughly 650,000 jobs since the start of the pandemic, with a disproportionate share of the job losses going to New Yorkers without a college credential. New York also faces an urgent need to protect coastal communities from storms and sea level rise, modernize vulnerable infrastructure, and transition away from fossil fuels.\n\nCity officials should get ahead of this by identifying\u2014and planning for\u2014ambitious and creative sustainability and resiliency projects that can create much-needed jobs for out-of-work New Yorkers while helping the city mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change.\n\nThis report aims to jumpstart the process. To better understand how New York can best take advantage of possible federal investment, we asked city leaders in urban agriculture, coastal resilience, environmental justice, conservation, renewable energy, urban design, green infrastructure, and the circular economy to give us concrete ideas of sustainability and resiliency projects that the city should run with should federal support materialize.\n\nThis report features their insights. It includes inventive and concrete project ideas from more than twenty experts, including resiliency experts Amy Chester of Rebuild by Design, Hildegaard Link of Resilient Red Hook, and Judah Asimov of RISE; clean energy experts including Chris Collins of SolarOne and Pat Sapinsley of NYU Tandon, architects Hana Kassem of Kohn Pedersen Fox, Jeffrey Raven of RAVEN A+U, and Clare Miflin of the Center for Zero Waste Design; urban tech pioneer Micah Kotch of URBAN-X; urban agriculture expert Henry Gordon Smith; and environmental leaders including Emily Nobel Maxwell of the Nature Conservancy and Sarah Charlop-Powers of the Natural Areas Conservancy, Paul Gallay of Riverkeeper, and Cortney Worral of Waterfront Alliance.\n\nSome of the ideas include:\n\nConstruct stormwater storage structures in low-lying neighborhoods\n\nDeploy a climate corps to install energy retrofits\n\nDevelop \u201cEcohubs\u201d in every NYCHA development\n\nCreate green jobs through resilience retrofit certifications\n\nBuild energy resilience through community solar\n\nConvert vacant storefronts into temporary hydroponic food production facilities.\n\nBoost green roof installation, starting with city property\n\nDesign and distribute curbside organic waste containers\n\nProtect coastal communities and infrastructure by investing in wetlands restoration\n\nBuild floating farms on barges in NYC waterways\n\n\n\nThe following are brief descriptions of the ideas we received:\n\nCortney Worrall\n\nPresident and CEO\n\nWaterfront Alliance\n\nCreate green jobs through resilience retrofit certifications\n\nInvesting in the development of worker certificate programs and expansion of home and small business retrofit and technical assistance programs such as FloodHelpNY can help create multiple career paths around resiliency retrofits. At scale, widespread resiliency retrofits programs have the potential to decrease flood damage risk, and reduce insurance premium costs for low-income families living in parts of the city that are increasingly vulnerable due to more frequent and damaging storms and sea level rise caused by climate change, and also create jobs. In particular, retrofit programs could create \u201cgreen and blue collar\u201d jobs in engineering, construction, science, research, education, masonry, landscaping, planning, utility operation, and more.\n\nGreen NYC\u2019s ports and energy infrastructure\n\nThe city should invest in resilient waterfront infrastructure by greening our ports and constructing renewable energy infrastructure. Wind and solar installation, operations, and maintenance can be housed at port facilities. Electrification of port vehicles and vessels will reduce air quality impacts to surrounding communities. In addition, every borough should have a working pier that can accommodate last-mile package delivery which will remove trucks from the road as e-commerce increases local delivery traffic.\n\nJeffrey Raven\n\nPrincipal\n\nRAVEN A+U\n\nPrioritize construction of \u201csponge city\u201d projects\n\nFaced with the urgent need to mitigate and adapt to climate change, NYC must prioritize urban design that accomplishes both. Sponge City infrastructure such as green roofs, underground stormwater basins, permeable pavements, and bioretention facilities help urban areas soak up as much stormwater as possible while also reducing carbon emissions, enhancing non-motorized transport networks and cooling the city. Construction of these types of projects should be prioritized in high-density areas such as Midtown Manhattan, Downtown Manhattan, and Downtown Brooklyn. New York can also incentivize private development of sponge city infrastructure through transferable development rights and credits/waivers for POPs (privately owned public park) space in designated areas of need.\n\nBuild a network of energy hubs\n\nThe city should build neighborhood energy hubs to store energy in large-capacity smart grid batteries, and secondarily act as recharge stations, bike storage, drop-off centers, civic spaces, or last-mile freight hubs. Placing energy hubs throughout New York City\u2019s neighborhoods would not only build energy resiliency within communities but act as colorful and aesthetically important symbols of each neighborhood. These colorful iconographic structures would be designed to reflect New York City's neighborhood identities and needs, instantly becoming 21st century icons on the urban landscape.\n\nConstruct stormwater storage structures in low-lying neighborhoods\n\nBuilding depressed roadways, parking lots, or parks along flood-prone coastline can help to temporarily store stormwater during extreme flood events. In addition, these projects can be multipurpose, with green infrastructure built above to provide win-win resilience and quality of life improvements. Areas that flood often, such as the Hudson River Park, FDR Drive, the BQE, and the Major Deegan Expressway should be prioritized.\n\nPat Sapinsley\n\nManaging Director of Cleantech Initiatives\n\nUrban Future Lab, NYU Tandon\n\nDeploy a climate corps to install energy retrofits in all buildings over 25,000 square feet\n\nIn order to meet the city\u2019s ambitious emissions reductions targets within the next decade, thousands of New York\u2019s older residential, office, and municipal buildings will need major retrofits to reduce building energy usage and carbon emissions. As part of a climate corps, a workforce should be trained in specific building energy efficiency upgrades. To achieve the city\u2019s 40 percent emissions reductions targets by the 2030 deadline, a workforce of nearly 150,000 people is needed. Funds could be made available via the PACE program for all commercial tenants and building owners. Green City Force, which enlists and trains people from low income housing communities in sustainable careers, can act as the workforce training model.\n\nUpgrade energy transmission lines\n\nIn order to deliver green power to the city, our transmission lines need a serious upgrade, and doing so will create many new jobs. The renewable energy we currently have in New York is almost entirely outside of the city\u2014large wind and solar farms in upstate New York, and hydropower from Niagara Falls and Canada. In order to bring clean energy into NYC, we must increase our transmission capacity. These new construction projects can be also focused on the locations needed for the large offshore wind energy projects currently planned.\n\nRepurpose public land into renewable power plants, microgrids, and energy storage\n\nReplacing fossil fuel-based power plants with renewable energy plus long duration energy storage facilities has been shown to result in significant cost savings in healthcare as well as job opportunities for the surrounding communities. Rikers Island is especially well-suited for this conversion, and has growing support as evidenced in the Renewable Rikers Act.\n\nEmily Nobel Maxwell\n\nNew York Cities Program Director\n\nThe Nature Conservancy\n\nBoost green roof installation, starting with city property\n\nThere are about a million buildings in New York City, but of those million buildings, in 2016 only an estimated 736 had green roofs\u2014roofs that are partially or completely covered with vegetation, a growing medium such as soil, waterproofing, and a drainage system. Green roofs improve air quality, enhance insulation, and increase building energy efficiency, while also reducing the urban heat island effect and absorbing stormwater. In addition to improving tax incentives to help expand private green roof installation, we should be maximizing green roofs on publicly owned property, prioritizing those facilities that may either be facing higher carbon emissions and/or present opportunities for public engagement, especially of New York City youth. School buildings in particular are well-suited for green roofing, in part because many have large, flat roofs. School buildings also use a significant amount of energy, creating a lot of carbon emissions, and so they are ripe for improvements to their energy efficiency. And if done right, green roofs on schools also create spaces for youth outdoor education and recreation. If green roofing were implemented on a much broader scale, especially on public property where the city exercises control over the building stock, there\u2019s also significant potential for job creation.\n\nRestore and expand New York City\u2019s urban forest\n\nNew York City\u2019s urban forest\u2014all the trees across the city\u2014cools the air, offers shady respite from heat, sequesters carbon, increases energy efficiency, and contributes to New Yorkers\u2019 health and wellbeing. But trees are not evenly distributed across the city. In fact, the most heat vulnerable neighborhoods tend to be low-income communities or communities of color with less tree cover, and these communities should be prioritized for investments. The city should invest in restoring, maintaining, and expanding its urban forest on city streets, in our parks, and especially on NYCHA campuses\u2014many of which are located in heat-vulnerable neighborhoods. Investments both to manage and protect existing trees and to increase trees in areas with less are crucial to providing more equitable access to the benefits of trees, from shade and cooling to mental health, all even more important in the COVID-19 era. Increased plantings and access upgrades can improve open spaces throughout the city while also making New York more resilient to the effects of climate change and providing great green jobs for New Yorkers.\n\nAdam Freed & Jake Elder\n\nPrincipal; Manager\n\nBloomberg Associates\n\nIncentivize building owners to replace gas boilers with electric units, and invest in upgrades to the energy grid so NYC can bring enough clean power to electrify buildings\n\nNatural gas and heating oil account for the majority of greenhouse gas emissions in New York\u2019s buildings, making the electrification of buildings across the five boroughs crucial to achieving our climate goals. And although the city\u2019s ambitious energy performance standards have been a big help, they are unlikely to spur the kind of large-scale replacement of gas boilers that is critically needed. The federal government can help by instituting a \u201cBucks for Boilers\u201d program\u2014similar to the old Cash for Clunkers vehicle program\u2014that incentivizes building owners to swap out inefficient gas boilers with cleaner electric or geothermal units. However, a big move to electrify buildings could triple demand on the city\u2019s electrical system. New York will need to make major new investments to upgrade the transmission and distribution lines that bring clean electricity from other parts of the state into the city. Most important will be a dramatic increase in investment in renewable energy; above and beyond the state\u2019s already ambitious plans. A federal public works program could provide critical capital to make these happen.\n\nReplace expressways with boulevards\n\nConstruction of the Sheridan and Gowanus expressways left surrounding communities isolated and stuck with some of the worst environmental, health, and economic conditions in the city. New York can begin to undo the damage to those communities by tearing down the two barrier expressways and replacing them with tree-lined boulevards, making the neighborhoods greener, safer, healthier, and more resilient. This could also free up land for more affordable housing and other community assets. The federal government could cover the planning grants and\u2014most importantly\u2014construction costs to get these resiliency projects off and running.\n\nCreate a sponge city\n\nWith more intense storms and more regular flooding expected in New York for years to come, it\u2019s time to follow China\u2019s lead, which is aiming to capture more than half of the rainwater that falls on its cities, and create a \u201csponge city\u201d. Every inch of rain that falls on New York generates a billion gallons of stormwater. Better managing this risk requires massive new investments to green surfaces across the city combined with more aggressive efforts to upgrade the infrastructure underground to handle more water. This can help save money, reduce flooding, improve the quality of neighborhoods, and prepare us for the increasing impacts of climate change. A federal infrastructure plan that invests more in urban water systems could provide precious resources to make this happen.\n\nClare Miflin\n\nFounder\n\nCenter for Zero Waste Design\n\nProvide space and technology for consolidated waste collection\n\nThe city\u2019s organic waste system of small bins collected door-to-door was cut because it was inefficient, expensive, and only collected a small fraction of the city\u2019s organic waste. By providing space and technologies for consolidated organic waste collection and distributed small-scale composting, the city could reduce costs and increase capacity and local benefits. Regenerating local soils will create green jobs, support urban greening and agriculture, and reduce the inequitable impacts of trucks, air pollution and greenhouse gases.\n\nDesign and distribute curbside organic waste containers\n\nDesigning containers into streetscapes allows drop-off for residents and small businesses, frees up space on sidewalks, and reduces odors and rats. Digital technology can be used to restrict access, reduce contamination, charge businesses, incentivize resident use, and reduce collection trips. Low impact vehicles can collect waste and take to local compost operations.\n\nDevelop neighborhood-scale composting infrastructure\n\nEquipment in large buildings can reduce odors, pests and the volume of organic waste by up to 90 percent, making it easier for understaffed and space-constrained buildings to manage. Investments in local composting infrastructure can increase processing capacities greatly, and excess organic material could be returned to the regional farm system.\n\nChris Collins\n\nExecutive Director\n\nSolar One\n\nInstall solar and battery storage on Rikers Island\n\nA large public works plan for New York City should include the Renewable Rikers project. Rikers Island is scheduled for closure in 2026, and it would be the perfect location to install solar and battery storage at scale that would, in effect, eliminate a large portion of the nearby peaker plants\u2014higher-polluting power plants that supply electricity only during periods of peak demand. There are parts of Rikers that could be converted to solar immediately to demonstrate the potential of solar and battery storage. The Renewable Rikers plan is being developed by a number of nonprofits and has been proposed in the City Council by Council Member Costa Constantinides.\n\nHenry Gordon-Smith\n\nFounding Director\n\nAgritecture\n\nBuild floating farms on barges in NYC waterways\n\nThe city could enlist a climate corps to construct or retrofit barges to house floating farms and greenhouses. Soil-based agriculture is more conducive to retrofitting barges or boats. Aqua Ark, a four-acre large floating farm structure off the coast of Hunts Point, is already being planned. Similar floating structures would be able to provide a sustainable food source while maintaining resilience against storm surges and sea level rise compared to traditional farms. Additionally, the waterfront provides great access to light and scale you wouldn't typically get in urban areas. These projects would be particularly useful along the Bronx waterfront due to food security needs, the large amount of coastline, and the minimal boat traffic.\n\nConstruct farms on unused, irregular lots\n\nThere are countless underutilized spaces along highways and railways that have the potential to be used for urban agriculture. Vacant, often linear plots of land are often overlooked for agricultural purposes but are just as useful as square lots. High Line-type spaces where the city still maintains the right of way along the corridor (such as the land available for the proposed Queensway project) would be good focal points. Similarly, the city should apply this rationale to any unused community space. Unused classrooms or lab spaces in marginalized communities can be converted into food production centers.\n\nDevelop workforce training in soil/water testing and remediation\n\nTraining and apprenticeships in soil/water testing and remediation, as part of a climate corps, could provide a pathway into careers in the environmental field while also helping the city identify and activate unused spaces for urban agriculture. The workforce would be trained how to assess plots of land for agricultural viability, and how to take soil and water samples and assess levels of contamination and remediation needs.\n\nHildegaard Link\n\nChair, Resilient Red Hook\n\nDirector, Sustainability, SEBS Rutgers University\n\nBuild energy resilience through community solar\n\nNeighborhoods served by above ground power lines are especially vulnerable to extreme weather. Constructing a microgrid powered by community solar would allow the neighborhood to power residents, businesses, and essential public services during emergencies that often plague the low-lying, coastal communities like Red Hook. Constructing a community grid of solar energy sources would also work to unify neighborhoods. A community solar grid could help to foster a shared sense of ownership within the neighborhood and also respond to the unique needs of local small businesses.\n\nAmy Chester\n\nManaging Director\n\nRebuild by Design\n\nProtect Hunts Point from flooding and sea level rise, and make its fresh market accessible to the nearby community\n\nThe meat, fish and produce markets of Hunts Point serve as the main food supply hub for New York City, but the low-lying peninsula is cut off from the nearby residential community and vulnerable to flooding. Previous funding has been used to provide backup energy generation, but more is needed to improve flood protections and ensure local residents have better access to fresh food from Hunts Point\u2019s wholesale markets.\n\nExtend Manhattan\u2019s coastal resiliency projects up the west side\n\nLower Manhattan is uniquely vulnerable to floodwater, storms, and other climate change impacts. But while there is funding in place for coastal protection from 25th Street on the East side around to Chambers Street on the West side, the floodplain extends all the way up to 57th Street. The city should develop a project funding plan to use new federal funding to extend coastal resiliency measures up the vulnerable West side of Manhattan.\n\nJudah Asimov\n\nSenior Manager, Planning & Outreach\n\nRockaway Initiative for Sustainability and Equity (RISE)\n\nEnhance Rockaways\u2019 dunes\n\nThe Rockaways\u2019 dunes are the community\u2019s first line of defense against increased storms and sea level rise from climate change, but they are in dire need of strengthening. A grant from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation allowed for preliminary design and assessment, but now the community needs more funding to implement the design to enhance the dunes and increase biodiversity.\n\nRaise the streets\n\nStreets in low-lying neighborhoods like Arverne, Edgemere, and Far Rockaway need to be raised in anticipation of increased storms and sea-level rise due to climate change. In addition, these neighborhoods are in dire need of storm sewer infrastructure. Currently, many streets experience regular flooding because water has nowhere to go. Surrounding developments have been raised to prevent flooding, but the streets themselves need the same protection.\n\nHana Kassem\n\nPrincipal\n\nKohn Pedersen Fox\n\nRevise East Side Coastal Resiliency Plan to leave park intact\n\nThe current East River resiliency proposal calls for raising the majority of the park above the 100-year flood plain, but that requires cutting down many of its trees and the phased decommissioning of large portions of the park. But given how vital the park is to multiple neighborhoods for exercise, social gathering, and informal cultural activities, especially during Covid-19, it may be worth revisiting the earlier version of the plan, which left most of the park intact by creating a flood barrier wall with flood gates along the east side of FDR. This resiliency strategy could be taken up again for the majority of the park, thus saving the park trees and maintaining its accessibility in some form during construction.\n\nReconfigure flood protections under FDR Drive to provide new, Covid-safe uses\n\nWhat if we rethought the underbelly of the elevated sections of the FDR to become a series of raised outdoor covered rooms that allowed for a variety of safe uses? These raised platforms would be combined with barrier walls and flood gates, positioned astutely to provide the necessary flood protection. To extend their use into the colder months, these outdoor rooms could be outfitted with solar-powered outdoor heaters and lighting. This large-scale project would foster social interaction and community spaces, boost the local restaurant and retail industries, reignite the city\u2019s cultural life, promote health and wellbeing, all while addressing resiliency, sustainability, wellness and creating jobs.\n\nLaurie Schoeman\n\nSenior Program Director, National Initiatives, Resilience\n\nEnterprise Community Partners\n\nConvert vacant storefronts into temporary hydroponic food production facilities\n\nGiven the widespread lack of access to fresh and local food in many communities, the urgent need for employment opportunities, and the extraordinary number of vacant storefronts and commercial spaces across the city, the city should develop a public-private partnership to convert these available spaces into indoor food production facilities. New York City should start with piloting this program in neighborhoods with high vacancy rates, and offer local home-grown agricultural leaders such as Gotham Greens, AeroFarms, or Sky Vegetables the opportunity to train jobseekers and expand urban agriculture.\n\nReduce the heat island effect by lightening the color of walls and streets\n\nDark-colored streets and building exteriors absorb 70 percent to 90 percent of radiant energy from the sun, which results in a \u201cheat island effect.\" In contrast, most light-colored surfaces, including white asphalt and fiberglass shingles absorb far less. Los Angeles is mitigating the heat island effect by painting roads in a white-colored, highly-reflective sealant. New York City needs to follow LA\u2019s example of lightening street surfaces, starting with walkways, bikeways, and sidewalks and expanding the program through procurement, engineering, and innovation.\n\nJustin Green\n\nFounder and Executive Director\n\nBig Reuse\n\nConstruct reuse centers in every neighborhood\n\nMaterial reuse can both help the environment and create local economic growth. Instead of buying a dresser that was made in another country from recently cutdown trees and shipped around the world\u2014we can reuse locally. In addition to the initial labor needed to build reuse centers, these facilities can create jobs for workers to manage and operate the facilities. Reuse and repair centers not only keep materials circulating within the community; they also keep the money exchanged for goods, repairs and refurbishment within the local economy, too. In the long term, these centers also encourage sustainable shopping behaviors. Reuse centers can create jobs, keep materials out of the landfill and become close to self-funded with some additional support for transitional workforces.\n\nRepurpose portions of public space & parkland into community composting sites\n\nConstructing composting sites would generate jobs not only from site development but from running the pickup and composting programs. This will encourage local composting and generate compost to divert materials from waste streams going to landfills.\n\nMaggie Greenfield\n\nExecutive Director / Bronx River Administrator\n\nBronx River Alliance\n\nClean and green urban rivers\n\nA federal stimulus package could include investments in urban waterways, such as the Bronx River, which are already drivers of economic development. Developing a jobs program to clean and green urban rivers--and the parks and trails that support them--would employ our neighbors who suffer most, and result in direct environmental improvements in communities where they are direly needed.\n\nLaunch a Green Infrastructure Stewardship Team\n\nGreen infrastructure such as rain gardens are essential to absorb rainwater and reduce the discharge of untreated sewage into our waterways. But without stewardship, rain gardens fill with garbage, inlets get clogged and plants die. The city should train and deploy a Stewardship Team to provide comprehensive management and upkeep of the city\u2019s rain gardens. With on-going care, the rain gardens can fulfill their promise of reducing sewer overflows and also add pollinator habitats and natural cooling for our rapidly heating cities.\n\nMicah Kotch\n\nManaging Director\n\nURBAN-X\n\nDevelop \u201cEcohubs\u201d in every NYCHA development\n\n\u201cEcohubs\u201d\u2014on-site farms designed as closed-loop systems\u2014should be constructed on unused land in NYCHA properties to not only provide fruits and vegetables to communities with limited access to fresh foods but to act as platforms for sustainability and agricultural education. The city, state, and federal government should fund the development of Ecohubs in every NYCHA development, with a NYCHA workforce. NYCHA Ecohubs would anchor organic food production, zero waste systems, rainwater catchment, and solar energy generation. NYCHA properties should be targeted due to the public health and economic development needs of their massive population.\n\nAfter initial construction, a conservation corps-type workforce comprised of NYCHA residents could be employed to maintain, manage, and educate the public about the Ecohub. Each Ecohub could employ one supervisor, ten to twelve service corps members, and support dozens of resident-led community organization partners. Reaching 100 sites in the first year of a new administration could employ 100 full-time site coordinators, 1,200 annual NYCHA conservation corps members, and hundreds of contractors (with priority for resident entrepreneurs and those employing residents as part of their business models). Additionally, on-the-job training could be provided by specialists in carpentry, hydroponics, and horticulture.\n\nPaul Gallay\n\nPresident and Hudson Riverkeeper\n\nRiverkeeper\n\nInvest in community-driven, nature-based coastal resilience projects\n\nWith sea levels rising, New York City must support community-driven, nature-based solutions for coastal resilience. Rather than focusing on expensive offshore storm surge barriers, the city should construct onshore environmental infrastructure such as berms, living shorelines, salt marshes, and wetlands which provide cheaper, more adaptable, and less ecologically destructive protection against sea level rise. Projects such as stormwater retention gardens and salt marsh restorations have already been successfully completed in other northeastern cities like Boston. Native plants and trees that can survive both dry and flooded conditions should also be prioritized in coastal communities. A workforce tasked with plant stewardship can be responsible for the long term care of these plantings. In designing and executing these climate-smart projects, front-line communities should be central, especially historically disempowered and BIPOC communities.\n\nInvest in habitat restoration at the Hudson River Sanctuary\n\nThe 400-acre estuarine sanctuary in the waters off Hudson River Park needs critical investment to ensure the health of the tidal ecosystem and its diverse fish population. This investment could also create jobs for a workforce mobilized to construct oyster castles and textured surfaces arounds piers and bulkheads to develop oyster habitats. Oyster reefs are important for New York City and the lower Hudson estuary because oysters filter excessive nutrients from the water and provide three-dimensional habitat for a wide variety of fish species. Additionally, building salt marshes and cordgrass fields in bays along the Hudson would create additional fish spawning areas while also helping to lower excess nutrient levels in the water.\n\nFast track construction of sewage and stormwater infrastructure\n\nNew York City discharges 21 billion gallons of sewage and stormwater into the harbor every year, and with climate change this number will grow. A public works program and climate corps could help fast-track the construction of large sewage and stormwater infrastructure projects that have already been planned. A sewage capture tunnel proposed for Newtown Creek would help prevent 1.3 billion gallons of discharge from contaminating the waterway per year. Additionally, moving forward with a plan for Rikers Island to convert 400-plus acres of land into a wastewater treatment facility and solar/energy farm would be a sound use of labor, provided we ensure that the project serves environmental justice goals and emphasizes community involvement.\n\nCandace Damon\n\nVice Chairman\n\nHR&A Advisors\n\nSupport maintenance projects\n\nThe default progressive response to economic downturn is to invest in capital projects that can be advanced quickly and that address other contemporary policy priorities\u2014today, resilience, climate adaptation, and equity. Virtually by definition, however, shovel-ready capital projects are those which have already been funded; directing stimulus funds to them replaces one source of funds with another. While New York City should certainly welcome any expansion of its investment capabilities, the shovel-ready projects for which there is no other source of funding, indeed for which there is vastly diminished funding, are maintenance projects.\n\nI would prioritize restoration of parks\u2014despite being, as always, the first operating budgets cut, parks have once again demonstrated their value as critical infrastructure\u2014and clean and efficient energy projects, including weatherization of homes and tune-up of building systems. But we should also support repair of major infrastructure, operating subsidies to strengthen regional food distribution and launch local agriculture, and a host of other maintenance projects that can be initiated within weeks of funding. These projects will all renew the aims of the Civilian Conservation Corps, this time ensuring that women and Black men get equitable access to jobs that are both less likely to be automated in the near term and offer career ladders.\n\nRen\u00e9e Crowley\n\nDeputy Director\n\nLES Ecology Center\n\nInvest in urban carbon farming\n\nThe city should invest in building up the health of the city\u2019s soil and encourage the development of green space with the goal of carbon sequestration. In partnership with community compost programs, the city can access locally produced compost made from New Yorkers\u2019 food scraps. This model of collecting local organic waste and transforming it into a rich resource to be used on local soils represents a highly sustainable closed loop system. Communities across the city could play a role in sequestering carbon from the atmosphere, transforming pockets of green space into local carbon sponges. Furthermore, when carbon is stored in the soils it increases its ability to retain water and combat coastal flooding.\n\nSarah Charlop-Powers\n\nExecutive Director and Co-Founder\n\nNatural Areas Conservancy\n\nBolster NYC\u2019s 7,300 acres of forested parkland\n\nIn the time of COVID-19, visitation to New York City\u2019s natural areas has increased between 65 and 100 percent. With millions of New Yorkers flocking to the city\u2019s forested parkland for relief and recreation, protecting these forests and improving access is even more important. However, much of the city\u2019s forests is in a state of ecological decline due to threats including invasive species. They require ongoing management to ensure that they continue to mitigate climate change and provide a myriad of environmental benefits to New York City. Many natural areas are also in need of safe, well-marked trails that improve access while protecting the forests in times of increased use. The city should make a major investment in citywide forest management to ensure that the city\u2019s forest can achieve its full potential for recreation and conservation, and create opportunities for green jobs and environmental education.\n\nProtect coastal communities and infrastructure by investing in wetlands restoration\n\nNew York City is projected to have six feet of sea level rise by 2100. The city\u2019s wetlands can play an important role as buffers from sea level rise and storms like Sandy, but these important wildlife areas require restoration and management to fulfill their resilience and buffering potential. We have located 120 potential wetland restoration opportunities spanning over 275 acres across the city. With large-scale, systematic investment in restoration and management across these sites, the city can ensure that wetlands provide crucial protection for coastal infrastructure and housing, while also ensuring access to the natural world and the social and public health benefits that come with spending time in nature.\n\nKatie Ellman\n\nPresident\n\nGreen Shores NYC\n\nRepair and fortify the Hallets Cove Esplanade\n\nProtecting the NYCHA Astoria Houses on Hallets Point in Astoria, Queens must be a priority for the city, and federal help can ensure the necessary infrastructure improvements happen. The campus esplanade\u2019s seawall, waterfront railing, and walking path are in a dangerous state of disrepair, and there is concern that water is seeping through the foundation of the seawall underground and potentially damaging the structural integrity of the apartment buildings. The Parks Department is to commence repair of the waterfront railing later this month, but better coordination and collaboration between the Army Corps of Engineers, Department of Environmental Conservation, Parks Department, NYCHA, Astoria Houses residents, elected officials, and community partners is needed to create a big-picture plan going forward. Climate change will bring continued sea level rise, and conditions here are ill-prepared for this increase.", "title": "A Green Public Works Program for NYC: 40 Ideas from Experts", "dataset": "['manual_google_by_location']", "labels": "['sustainability', 'policy']", "annot_city": "['New York']"}, {"id": 8727, "city": null, "url": "https://www.amny.com/news/two-dozen-subway-cars-struck-in-overnight-weekend-graffiti-storm/", "text": "Sign up for our COVID-19 newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest coronavirus news throughout New York City\n\nBy Jose Martinez, THE CITY\n\nThis article was originally published on Dec 2 at 9:48 pm EST by THE CITY\n\nSubway taggers went on a weekend graffiti blitz, striking 24 cars on six lines, THE CITY has learned \u2014 including an M train coated in \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d-like images of a white rabbit and a Mad Hatter.\n\nThe bulk of the hits occurred during the nightly 1 a.m.-to-5 a.m. suspension of subway passenger service, a source with knowledge of the incidents said. Most took place in tunnels and along stretches of out-of-service tracks used to store trains \u2014 areas that are supposed to be patrolled by the NYPD.\n\nOf the 183 subway-car graffiti hits this year, 153 of them \u2014 or 83% \u2014 have occurred in the so-called layup areas, according to an MTA spokesperson, while the remainder have come in subway yards secured by transit officials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cWe have a zero-tolerance policy for vandalism, which takes valuable time, resources and taxpayer dollars away from the system at a time when the MTA is facing the worst financial crisis in its history,\u201d said Sarah Feinberg, interim president of New York City Transit.\n\nTaggers struck trains on the 1, 6, M, G and Q lines, as well as on the 42nd Shuttle, said Aaron Donovan, an MTA spokesperson, in what transit sources described as an \u201cunusually high\u201d number of incidents.\n\nSubway trains that are victims of what the MTA calls \u201cmajor hits\u201d are immediately taken out of service and sent to be scrubbed. Graffiti vandalism, a class A misdemeanor, can put a tagger in jail for up to a year. The agency also seeks restitution of train-cleaning costs from anyone caught in the act.\n\n\u2018Going Back in Time\u2019\n\nThe multi-colored hit on the M train was discovered at 4:58 a.m. Monday during a pre-service inspection near the 169th Street station in Queens, according to an internal incident report obtained by THE CITY.\n\nWith its first five cars covered in spray-painted flames, mushrooms, tags and a bare-breasted pot-smoking character with a resemblance to Betty Boop, the train was transferred to a yard for cleaning.\n\n\u201cThis is like going back in time, for sure,\u201d Lesya Musiyeeska, 44, an M train rider in Queens, said after seeing photos of the graffiti-coated train. \u201cIt\u2019s not a good thing and I worry that it\u2019s only the beginning.\u201d\n\nThe number of graffiti incidents in stations through the end of November is slightly lower than for all of 2019, a transit source told THE CITY. The MTA did not confirm those numbers.\n\nMTA figures show the graffiti hits in and on subway trains this year are down from 276 at this time in 2019. Overnight subway service was suspended in May, nearly two months into a pandemic that sent ridership down more than 90% at its lowest point.\n\nSeveral subway underworld experts, including former taggers, told THE CITY that the graffiti is often the product of people from outside the U.S. who seek social media buzz through photos and videos of their work.\n\n\u2018Enforcement Is Way Down\u2019\n\nBad Guy Joe \u2014 the alias of an underground explorer who photographs tunnels and abandoned spaces around the city for LTVSquad.com \u2014 said covering a single subway car can take two to three hours.\n\nHe said the photos of the \u201cAlice in Wonderland\u201d-themed M train, with elaborate work covering five of the eight cars, show \u201ca progression in confidence\u201d among artists.\n\n\u201cEnforcement is obviously way down,\u201d he told THE CITY. \u201cGraffiti writers on a whole are way more confident than they were just three or four years ago.\u201d\n\nGraffiti\u2019s presence in the subway system is still far from what it was when entire spray-painted trains became a symbol of a city in decline. In the 1970s and 80s, hundreds of millions of dollars were spent combating graffiti.\n\nBut it still surfaces.\n\nJust after 1 a.m. Monday, four cars on the G coated in blue and black spray paint were discovered at the line\u2019s Court Square terminal in Long Island City, Queens, leaving riders without full service during the morning rush, according to an incident report.\n\nThe run of graffiti and vandalism incidents come in the wake of officials at the transit agency pinning a rise in subway crime on the NYPD and what MTA Chairperson Patrick Foye has called an \u201cinexplicable and unacceptable\u201d decrease in the number of arrests and summonses.\n\nNYPD figures presented to the MTA board last month show an increase from 2019 in reports in five of the six major crime categories, along with a 63% drop in subway arrests and a nearly 85% decrease in farebeating arrests.\n\nThrough the first 10 months of the year, NYPD figures show, police made 428 \u201ctheft of service\u201d arrests, down from 2,793 in the same period in 2019.\n\nFollowing multiple instances of riders being pushed onto the tracks, the NYPD last week pledged to increase police presence in the subway by transferring into the transit system 120 officers who had previously been on protests and demonstration duty.\n\nAn Around the Clock Job\n\nPatrick Lynch, president of the Police Benevolent Association, said officers share the frustration of riders and MTA officials.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing in the subway, not only in terms of vandalism but also violent crime, is a direct result of our elected leaders\u2019 policy choices,\u201d Lynch said in a statement to THE CITY. \u201cThey took the \u2018Cops out of MTA\u2019 slogan straight off the protest signs and ran with it.\u201d\n\nRiders said they have noticed a lack of police in the transit system.\n\n\u201cYou need them on the trains and platforms,\u201d said Leonardo Marin, 50, who was catching an M train at Middle Village-Metropolitan Avenue in Queens. \u201cBut you can go a long way in the subway before ever seeing a single police officer.\u201d\n\nThe NYPD did not immediately comment on the graffiti incidents.\n\n\u201cOur cleaners work around the clock to remove the graffiti when it is found so we can keep our full fleet in service,\u201d Feinberg said.\n\nTHE CITY is an independent, nonprofit news outlet dedicated to hard-hitting reporting that serves the people of New York.", "title": "Two dozen subway cars struck in overnight weekend graffiti storm", "dataset": "['manual_google_by_location']", "labels": "['not_sure']", "annot_city": "['New York']"}, {"id": 8728, "city": null, "url": "https://therealdeal.com/2020/12/03/landlords-lose-challenge-against-pandemic-renter-protections/", "text": "A group of New York landlords are considering an appeal after a federal judge rejected their bid to challenge tenant protections put in place by the City Council.\n\nThe landlords argued that the measures, passed by the Council in May as part of a Covid-relief effort, violated their constitutional rights, according to Crain\u2019s.\n\nBut Judge Ronnie Abrams said they hadn\u2019t made their case.\n\n\u201cPlaintiffs have expressed some legitimate concerns, and the court recognizes the toll the pandemic has taken on them, in addition to their tenants, all New Yorkers and millions more around the world,\u201d the judge wrote.

That lawsuit was dismissed in 2018 and reopened a year later with the project\u2019s fundraiser, an EB-5 regional center known as CanAm Enterprises, added as a plaintiff.\n\nBut in October, the developer and the contractor wrote a letter to the court claiming that there was a \u201cjurisdictional defect,\u201d and that the case should never have been filed in district court to begin with.

On the same day, one of the project\u2019s contractors, Mammoet, filed a suit in New York State Supreme Court against CanAm and the developer, seeking to move the entire dispute to a new venue.\n\nWhile the jurisdictional issue plays out, the lawsuits also offer vastly differing accounts at what went wrong with the New York Wheel project. In its most recent suit, the developer alleges that the project\u2019s contractors, Mammoet and Starneth (the latter of which is not named as a party in either lawsuit), underestimated how much it would cost to build the wheel. The contractors realized they would lose money so instead, they jacked up the fixed costs, according to the complaint.\n\nMammoet, meanwhile, alleges in its most recent lawsuit that the developer breached its contract and failed to pay for the work performed since November 2016.

I have to also wonder whether tapping New York\u2019s plentiful natural gas supplies, nearly in New York City\u2019s backyard, would make at least a little bit, or even far more sense for New York State as a whole?\n\nNew York\u2019s extraordinary regulatory resources would no doubt employ the highest state-of-the-art technology to protect the environment to the greatest extent possible. This appears highly preferable to forcing that regulatory responsibility on others likely less resourced, or otherwise less capable of aggressively protecting the environment where the energy is sourced.\n\nToday it has become very politically expedient to oppose all fossil fuels, oil, natural gas, coal, and also carbon-free nuclear energy, sources that have historically provided New York energy reliability regionally through a wide diversity of supply sources.\n\nThe wind does not blow all the time, nor does the sun always shine. While renewables can help, they are no panacea when it comes to reliability absent other sources.\n\nIs it good public policy to eliminate the diversity of sources of supply \u2014 that you can readily control for reliability and cost reasons, and instead embark upon an economically and environmentally costly and uncertain path \u2014 ultimately leading New York to be highly dependent upon a foreign source of supply?\n\nI just wonder whether short-term politically expedient decision-making has not painted New York State into a corner \u2014 leaving it stuck pursuing a solution that is far more harmful to New York State, and way out of proportion to the magnitude of the problem it seeks to solve.\n\nAnd, finally, I also wonder: Will the consequences of the proposed path simply come home to roost on all New Yorkers \u2014 after our currently elected officials are long gone?\n\nChristopher Corbett\n\nColonie\n\nEditor\u2019s note: Christopher Corbett notes he is an engineer and was employed by New York State Department of Public Service, Energy Division from 1974 to 2006.", "title": "Has New York painted itself into a corner?", "dataset": "['manual_google_by_location']", "labels": "['energy']", "annot_city": "['New York']"}, {"id": 8735, "city": null, "url": "https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/lapd-could-see-layoffs-as-city-struggles-with-budget-deficit/2476039/", "text": "City officials say layoffs at the Los Angeles Police Department are \"on the table\" as the coronavirus pandemic continues to ravage the local economy and take its toll on government coffers.\n\nMayor Eric Garcetti said Wednesday he hopes laying off city employees, including LAPD personnel, will be a last-resort measure, but the city is prepared to do so amid financial struggles due to the health crisis.\n\n\"I hope that (layoffs are) at the very bottom of the list, and our City Administrative Officer (Richard Llewellyn) has asked us\u2026all of our departments to say how will we close this worst-case scenario if there is no help,\" Garcetti said.\n\n\"The reason why I want layoffs to be the very last thing is it hits our most vulnerable employees and key services.\"\n\nThe City Council has been mulling ways to reduce potential layoffs or furloughs in the last few months, but that was before the recent spike of COVID-19 cases.\n\nGarcetti said during Wednesday's COVID-19 update that Los Angeles is still pleading for federal assistance to help cities recuperate from the economic effects of the pandemic.\n\nLAPD Chief Michel Moore told reporters Wednesday that \"We have already experienced\u2026a reduction in our workforce, between sworn and civilian, in excess of 500 personnel.

However, Diaz says job applicants with criminal records still face hiring discrimination and Reboot LA offers a way for former inmates to learn valuable skills. \u201cLearning how to code is very much an in-demand skill,\u201d said Diaz. \u201cIt can lend you a job anywhere in the tech spectrum from a start-up, to consulting, to a corporate job.\u201d\n\nWith Reboot LA, the goal is for graduates to create their own book of business and find clients, allowing students like Cardoza to take control of their own destiny.\n\n\u201cI also want to eventually, if I can, incorporate teaching coding to kids and going back into education,\u201d said Cardoza.\n\nThe program is currently accepting applications.

Growing up a foster kid in group homes, Turner said he couldn't find his self-esteem.\n\n\"I wanted to gang bang. I wanted to surround myself with drugs and guys that didn't really have any ambitions for their future. And I chose that, and that's how I ended up in the streets, ultimately,\" Turner explained.\n\nIt's been a long journey to get here. Turner spent years sleeping on couches and floors until 2018 when he decided enough was enough. Antwone Sanford enrolled him in Fresh Start, a program that offers clients education, temporary housing, and emotional and spiritual counseling \u2014 everything needed to integrate back into society.\n\n\"There's all kinds of needs, every day something different,\" Sanford explained. \"People's situations are different, but we use our resources to show them hope and provide help and opportunity for each and every one of our clients.\"\n\nEven if it takes more than once, the first time Turner graduated from the Mission's program, he fell off the horse and returned to the streets, he said. But last year, he decided he was ready to make a change for good.\n\nSanford let him return to the L.A. Mission's restart program, and although he's helped about 60 other people like Turner get housing in the last two years, Sanford said he is still amazed to see him evolve.\n\n\"It's a God thing. It's amazing,\" he said. \"I'm in awe of God, and I'm really grateful to see how Zion has been cared for and supported and how he's taken initiative and stepped up and be better and do better and look for better in his life. I'm excited about that.\"\n\nTurner is excited too. A year ago, he never would've imagined the Mission would welcome him back with a full-time job and the resources to get the first place he's ever called his own, he said.\n\n\"If I had a dollar for every time someone said, you gotta go bro. Man. I'm at a loss for words, kind of. I think I'm gonna cry maybe.

After Thursday\u2019s hearing, the Los Angeles County district attorney\u2019s office said Leung was guilty of illegally donating \u201chundreds of thousands of dollars\u201d in the hope that local elected officials would rezone his property and approve his 352-unit project in L.A.'s Harbor Gateway neighborhood.\n\nDaniel Nixon, Leung\u2019s attorney, did not respond to requests for comment. Superior Court Judge Jose I. Sandoval dismissed a related bribery charge against Leung.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe guilty plea came more than four years after a Times investigation revealed that a sprawling network of more than 100 people and companies with direct or indirect ties to Leung \u2014 including relatives, business partners, coworkers and others \u2014 made political donations totaling more than $600,000 while Leung\u2019s project, then known as Sea Breeze, was under review. The project was approved in 2015.\n\nIn 2016, The Times went to the homes and workplaces of dozens of donors to ask them about their contributions. Among those who agreed to be interviewed, 11 denied making contributions or said they didn\u2019t remember doing so. One Chatsworth resident told The Times she had been reimbursed for at least one of her donations.\n\nLeung had been facing a possible maximum sentence of four years and eight months in state prison. On Thursday, he was sentenced to five years\u2019 probation and 500 hours of community service. He also agreed to pay an as-yet-undetermined amount of restitution to the city of Los Angeles.\n\nThe real estate developer will put $2.5 million into an escrow account until the city\u2019s Ethics Commission determines the amount he owes, Nixon said during the hearing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLeung\u2019s money laundering case is separate from a federal corruption probe that centers on real estate development, campaign donations and alleged bribes in the district represented by Councilman Jose Huizar, who was effectively ousted by his colleagues several months ago.\n\nIn that case, federal prosecutors alleged that Huizar ran a criminal enterprise in which businessmen provided campaign donations, hotel stays, casino chips and other gifts in exchange for help with their real estate projects. Huizar has pleaded not guilty to racketeering, bribery and other charges.\n\nTwo years after The Times published its Sea Breeze investigation, prosecutors in the district attorney\u2019s office filed charges alleging Leung and a secretary, Sofia David, made political donations without revealing that the money either came from him or was reimbursed to the donors by him and \u201cothers acting at his direction.\u201d\n\nDavid, who was also charged with conspiracy to commit campaign money laundering, still has not been arrested. Prosecutors said she remains a fugitive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Leung case was jointly investigated by the D.A.'s office, the FBI, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office and the Ethics Commission.\n\nLeung proposed his Harbor Gateway apartment project, located on Sepulveda Boulevard near Normandie Avenue, roughly a decade ago. It was initially opposed by staffers in the Department of City Planning, who advised against rezoning the site from manufacturing to a commercial land use. The Planning Commission, made up of appointees of Mayor Eric Garcetti, rejected the project outright.\n\nGarcetti and the City Council took steps to overrule the commission\u2019s decision in 2014 and 2015, paving the way for Sea Breeze to be built.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the project was under review, Leung\u2019s employees, business partners and many others in his orbit made donations to campaigns, officeholder accounts and political committees supporting an array of elected officials, including Garcetti, County Supervisor Janice Hahn and City Councilman Joe Buscaino, who represented the Harbor Gateway neighborhood.\n\nAn apartment project in Harbor Gateway was at the heart of a campaign money laundering case against developer Samuel Leung. The project is now built and open. (Travis Geske / For The Times)\n\nThe Times\u2019 investigation found that a single house, located on 223rd Street in unincorporated West Carson, generated more than $40,000 in political donations from a handful of residents \u2014 Mexican and Central American immigrants who had jobs working on Leung properties. One person living in the house, a repairman originally from El Salvador, gave 22 donations totaling $20,300 over roughly eight years, according to contribution reports.\n\nMore than half of the repairman\u2019s donations went to committees supporting Hahn while she was on the council and pursuing local, state and federal office. Asked why he donated so much money to Hahn, he said he could not remember.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOver several years, Hahn received about $203,000 from donors directly or indirectly connected to Leung, much of it while she was serving on the council representing the district where Sea Breeze had been proposed.\n\nAsked about Leung\u2019s plea, Hahn issued a one-sentence statement. \u201cI hope he is held accountable,\u201d she said.\n\nBuscaino, who replaced Hahn as the Harbor area\u2019s representative in 2012, received $94,700 in contributions from donors connected to Leung. He was also a proponent of the project. On Thursday, when asked about the case, Buscaino said campaign finance laws are meant to ensure public trust in the election process.\n\n\u201cAnyone who breaks these laws must be held accountable and that is what happened today,\u201d he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBuscaino told The Times in 2016 that he would return any campaign funds found by investigators to be improper. On Thursday, an aide to the councilman said the political accounts that received the money were closed years ago. Instead, he said, an equal amount of money has been \u201credistributed to local nonprofits.\u201d\n\nA political committee that supported Garcetti\u2019s 2013 mayoral bid, but was not controlled by him and operated independently from his campaign, received $60,000 from companies and individuals with ties to Leung.\n\nOn Thursday, a Garcetti spokesman said the mayor\u2019s own campaigns did not accept donations from Leung or his associates.\n\n\u201cThe mayor was unaware of any misconduct when he chose to support the housing project,\u201d said Garcetti aide Alex Comisar. \u201cHe hopes Mr. Leung faces the consequences for his illegal behavior.\u201d\n\nOther politicians who received donations from peopleconnected to Leung included Huizar, former Councilman Mitchell Englander and Councilman Gil Cedillo \u2014 all of whom served on the council committee that reviewed Sea Breeze in 2014. Donations also went to the 2015 reelection campaign of Councilwoman Nury Martinez.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMartinez is now council president. Englander pleaded guilty in July as part of the federal government\u2019s \u201cpay to play\u201d corruption probe.\n\nSea Breeze opened last year and is now occupied by tenants.

Michele Smith (43rd), who represents Lincoln Park. Laramar has agreed to preserve its structures as part of a larger development plan that would include two new apartment buildings on Halsted, she said.\n\n\u201cThis has been in the hopper for a very long time, and we\u2019re glad it\u2019s coming up,\u201d Smith said. \u201cLaramar has had a history in our neighborhood of buying historic buildings and keeping them. We appreciate their efforts.\u201d\n\nThe proposal would also need the approval of the Chicago City Council.\n\nLandlords sometimes fight landmarking proposals for their properties because it prevents them from demolishing or changing buildings. But landmarked buildings are also eligible for tax incentives that can make properties more profitable to own.\n\nThe proposal would protect buildings at 1727-1729 N. Halsted, currently the home of Boka restaurant; 1733 N. Halsted, occupied by Pizza Capri; 1730-1732 N. Halsted, the longtime home of Vinci, an Italian restaurant; and 1800 N. Halsted, where the Willow Room, another bar and restaurant, opened four years ago. The buildings, which include apartments on their upper floors, were constructed between 1880 and 1890.\n\nBack in 2013, Chicago developer Golub floated a proposal to raze the building at 1800 N. Halsted, then the home of the Black Duck Tavern & Grille, to make way for an apartment development on the block.\n\nBut Smith shot down that idea, and Golub opted instead to sell its properties in the neighborhood\u201411 buildings totaling 143 apartments\u2014to Laramar, a Chicago multifamily landlord. Golub made out well in the 2014 sale, receiving $50 million from Laramar, more than double what it paid for the properties in 2012.\n\nOf the four buildings before the landmarks panel, Laramar owns all but 1733 N. Halsted, which is owned by local investor James Masterson III, according to Cook County property records. A Laramar executive did not respond to a request for comment, and efforts to reach Masterson were unsuccessful.\n\nIn 2016, Laramar unveiled a proposal to construct two apartment buildings with 21 units, one on a parking lot just south of Vinci and the other on a parking lot just north of a building it owns at 1818 N. Halsted. Laramar is sticking with that plan, Smith said.\n\nDesigned in the Italianate and Queen Anne Style popular in the late 19th century, the four buildings serve as well-preserved examples of the period and provide a \u201cgateway\u201d to Lincoln Park from the city, according to the planning department report.\n\n\u201cTaken together, these buildings create a sense of place that exemplifies the historical significance of neighborhood mixed-use buildings and the streetscapes they created,\u201d the report says.\n\nThe buildings also \u201cexemplify the importance of Chicago's Germans, one of the largest ethnic communities in the city's history,\u201d according to the report. The area between Chicago and Fullerton avenues was the \u201cepicenter\u201d of the German community in Chicago in the late 19th century.\n\n\u201cWith the wave of development in the Lincoln Park community area in the 1880s and 1890s, concentrations of German bakeries, tailor shops, butchers, woodworking shops, and other small businesses run by local residents began to flourish in the neighborhood,\u201d the report says.\n\nGermans lived in and ran businesses out of the four buildings on Halsted street. Ludwig Hammerstrom, who emigrated from Prussia in 1856, built the structure at 1800 N. Halsted. The building\u2019s cornice includes a small inscription, \u201cL.

Approximately 60,000 businesses are also required to provide recycling services to their tenants, according to the city\u2019s ordinance. Failure to comply with the city's recycling ordinance can result in fines ranging between $500 and $5,000 per day, under a law that took effect in 2017.\n\nThe city\u2019s blue cart recycling program is only available for single-family homes in the city and buildings with no more than four units.

However, they declined to make any changes until an ongoing study of the city\u2019s waste and recycling policies is completed in 2021 by the Delta Institute, according to the audit.\n\n\u201cAs we await the city\u2019s comprehensive waste study and its eventual impact on a proactive enforcement strategy, we are encouraged that the Department of Streets and Sanitation agreed with our recommendations and has begun collaborating with other departments to improve its citation system and address compliance issues,\u201d Ferguson said in a statement.\n\nStreets and San has been charged with enforcing the city\u2019s recycling ordinance since 2011, when former Mayor Rahm Emanuel disbanded the Department of Environment. The Department of Environment was able to ticket the owners of commercial properties and large apartment buildings for violating the recycling ordinance, but Streets and San employees do not have that capability, according to the audit.\n\nOwners of large apartment complexes and commercial buildings are required to hire one of 15 licensed waste haulers in the city to handle their trash and recyclables.

Of the 15 firms, six firms met the deadline to submit 2018 reports, while three filed late. After an inquiry by the inspector general, three more reports were submitted to Streets and San \u2014 while two remain unfiled, according to the audit.\n\nNone of the reports were assessed by city officials for accuracy, according to the audit.\n\nThat information could help the city \u201ccalculate diversion rates, set goals and monitor progress,\u201d according to the audit.\n\nThe inspector general recommended that the city\u2019s ticketing system be changed to allow those violating the recycling ordinance to be cited and urged Streets and San to require detailed reports from private waste haulers.\n\nBetween 8% and 9% of the trash produced every year by Chicago residents is kept out of landfills, officials told aldermen during hearings on the city\u2019s 2021 budget.\n\nBy comparison, residents of New York City recycled 17% of their trash. In Los Angeles, the recycling rate is 76.4% \u2014 in part because of strict rules set by California officials.\n\nEfforts to boost Chicago\u2019s recycling rate has been complicated by a drop in the price recycled goods can sell for in the international market and a lack of local facilities that can process glass, plastic and paper for reuse, officials said.\n\nPrivate firms had until the end of November to submit new proposals to city officials to haul away recyclables from blue carts in two of the six sections of the city.\n\nAny new deal, set to start in January and last for three years, that will replace a $12 million contract inked in 2011 will include penalties for the contractors if they miss pickups, a frequent complaint of residents, as well as plans for more composting of organic waste, said Department of Streets and Sanitation Deputy Commissioner for Policy and Sustainability Chris Sauve.\n\nContact Heather Cherone: @HeatherCherone | (773) 569-1863 | [email protected]\n\nThanks to our sponsors: View all sponsors", "title": "Chicago is Failing to Enforce Recycling Laws: Watchdog", "dataset": "['manual_google_by_location']", "labels": "['recycle']", "annot_city": "['Chicago']"}, {"id": 8745, "city": null, "url": "https://patch.com/illinois/chicago/chicago-plans-reopen-schools-ask-teachers-return-even-if-majority-students-stay-hom", "text": "By Cassie Walker Burke, Chalkbeat Chicago Chicago plans to reopen schools in January and February even if the majority of its students choose to continue learning virtually, the city's school chief said Wednesday.\n\nTeachers also will be asked to return unless they request formal leave for family or medical reasons. \"The way I look at it, we're crafting a plan for 100% of wishes,\" Chicago Public Schools CEO Janice Jackson told Chalkbeat in a wide-ranging interview about the city's reopening plans. \"Parents who want to continue with remote learning because their children are thriving will continue to have that option. But families who feel that in-person instruction is best, or families who don't have a choice \u2014 parents who are essential workers deserve an option too \u2014 we will provide that.\"\n\nChicago will soon get an updated barometer of its families' wishes, with families of elementary and middle school students supposed to inform the district next week of their choice to continue learning virtually or return to campuses. But Jackson made clear that, while those numbers will help the city plan, they won't affect its overall decision making \u2014 even as the teachers union says low opt-in rates from earlier surveys should have convinced the district to keep school doors closed. \"We have to shift from looking at just percentages,\" Jackson continued, acknowledging that low opt-in percentages among Black and Latino families were cited as one of the reasons district leaders initially delayed a September reopening. \"I know we focused on that in the summer, but at the end of day, even if it's 40% or 20%, essentially we're talking about tens of thousands of people in this city who want an option other than what we're offering.\"\n\nAcross the country, several school districts have decided to reopen schools even as the majority of parents choose remote learning. That presents a conundrum for districts and school leaders: How to deliver in-person instruction while addressing the quality of remote learning for the majority of students who choose to remain online. There's also the daunting task of how to convince teachers to sign on to return amid rising COVID-19 positivity rates and criticism from the union that represents them. Citywide, the positivity rate is around 12%, but in some low-income neighborhoods on the West Side, rates are hovering around 20%.\n\n\"There have been two surveys, one last summer, and one this fall, where parents said, 'No thank you.' What they have said, very clearly, is that they want remote learning,\" said Stacy Davis Gates, the union's vice president, in an interview Tuesday on WBEZ's Reset. \"We have to delve into the reasons why families are reluctant to return to school buildings and use that to build a plan for safe reopening. You can reopen a building \u2014 that doesn't mean that families will follow.\"\n\nFamilies of children in kindergarten through eighth grade are supposed to inform the district next week of their choice: to continue learning virtually until at least April, or return to campuses by Jan. 11 for pre-kindergartners or special education students and Feb. 1 for kindergarten through eighth grade. Anecdotally, some schools have reported that they haven't heard yet from large numbers of parents. The district's default position for families that don't return surveys will be to continue with remote learning, and it will double down on outreach for surveys as the due date approaches.", "title": "Chicago Plans To Reopen Schools And Ask Teachers To Return, Even If The Majority Of Students Stay Home", "dataset": "['manual_google_by_location']", "labels": "['school']", "annot_city": "['Chicago']"}, {"id": 8746, "city": null, "url": "https://www.chicagobusiness.com/crains-daily-gist/crains-daily-gist-podcast-downtown-falls-behind-chicago-area-real-estate-boom", "text": "Click here to subscribe to Crain's Daily Gist on iTunes, Spotify and Stitcher!

Sanders, president of the Kiest Forest Estates Neighborhood Association, said one of them came within just a few feet from her bedroom wall.\n\nShe has lived in Dallas City Council District 3 since 1980 and street racing has been a consistent problem over the years. Racers often show up in groups of 10 or 15. They come in cars and trucks, lay waste to city streets and put the public in danger. It\u2019s only a matter of time before she or a neighbor gets killed, she said.\n\nSanders and one of those neighbors, Craig Wheeler, vice president of the association, pleaded for help at Wednesday's council meeting, saying more needs to be done to crack down on street racing.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t feel like there are any steps in the right direction on a solution,\u201d Wheeler said.\n\nStreet racing has spiked citywide. Deputy Police Chief Jesse Reyes said around 2,000 street racers out on any given weekend, more participants than ever, and often several events are taking place at the same time across the city.\n\nThe city has taken steps to stomp out the racing operations. In May, the council passed an ordinance expanding the criteria for who could be cited for street racing and trick driving. The ordinance made it illegal to spectate or be in the presents of a street race. Additionally, people who allow races to take place on their property can be cited, and in some circumstances, vehicles can be seized.\n\nThis year\u2019s street racing enforcement has resulted in 1,196 arrests, 612 spectator citations and 184 felony charges. Additionally, DPD has seized 48 guns, towed 659 vehicles and recovered 34 stolen vehicles. Reyes said that while they have been able to temporarily impound cars, no individual has met all of the criteria necessary to have their vehicle seized.\n\n\u201cWe're gonna have to come up with a better way to get there faster.\" \u2013 City Councilman David Blewett Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nReyes said the department has started sending letters to some of the registered owners of the street racing vehicles asking them to reach out to the police department. In some cases, DPD has found that the car is being used by a family member of the registered owner. Through this, the department is able to stop some people from racing. So far, they have sent 88 of these letters.\n\nThe police department and the city attorney are looking into using Dallas\u2019 riot statute and the Clean Air Act to further eradicate street racing.\n\nThe riot statute defines a riot as an assembly of at least seven people \"which creates an immediate danger to persons or property, obstructs law enforcement functions or services, or by force, threat, or physical action deprives or disturbs any person of a legal right.\"\n\nThe Clean Air Act prevents outdoor burning, which DPD said sometimes occurs at street races, in areas that do not meet the national ambient air quality standards. Dallas does not.\n\nThe city ordinance also redesignated street racing reports from Priority 4 to Priority 2 calls, which require a response from police within 12 minutes. The problem is that wait times at the department's call center are through the roof and police response time is not up to par.\n\nCouncil member David Blewett said DPD often takes twice that amount of time or longer to show up to the scene. By then, the racers are usually gone. He urged the council to support having the calls designated as Priority 1. \u201cWe're gonna have to come up with a better way to get there faster,\u201d Blewett said.\n\nReyes said DPD needs more manpower.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very manpower intensive, especially with the mobility of these groups,\u201d he said.\n\nSeveral council members were interested in seeking additional support from the Department of Public Safety. Gov. Greg Abbott recently deployed DPS into Dallas to help get violent crime under control. DPS is not set to help the department with its street racing enforcement, but Reyes said he welcomes any additional resources.\n\nBut council member Omar Narvaez argued that the department has the officers it needs, but too many of them are tied up doing work that he said could be done by civilian employees. \u201cWe already have these peace officers. We employ them as we speak. So how do we more efficiently utilize them?\u201d Narvaez asked.\n\nLocal\n\nCommunity\n\nJournalism\n\nI Support Support the independent voice of Dallas and help keep the future of Dallas Observer free. Support Us\n\nBased on a staffing study it conducted, the consulting firm KPMG recommended the use of more civilian employees at DPD. The city has taken steps toward implementing this recommendation, allocating funds in next year\u2019s budget to replace 95 positions with civilian employees so more officers can be on the streets.\n\nUntil that happens, Narvaez said, the department should try to use some of the officers working civilian positions to help enforce street racing laws.\n\nSome council members suggested directing the street racers to other venues, like local tracks. It\u2019s not a completely original idea. The city of Atlanta has even entertained designating certain areas for drag racing per the recommendation of the mayor\u2019s 18-year-old son, according to CBS .\n\nBut council member Carolyn King Arnold said the city shouldn\u2019t have to create a PR campaign to direct racers to local tracks. \u201cThey know where to go,\u201d she said.

These are small loans offered to folks with poor credit at annual percentage rates as high as 500%. Now, some faith leaders are saying it\u2019s time to update the city\u2019s rules to protect consumers from new loan products they call predatory.\n\nDallas\u2019 2010 ordinance didn\u2019t ban payday loans outright, but it added transparency and guard rails to keep loan companies from lending money on terms that made it more challenging to pay off, and often forced people into a spiral of endless re-financing and fees.\n\nEven though the city\u2019s rules didn\u2019t cap fees on the loans, Minister Danielle Ayers of Friendship-West Baptist Church said Thursday that the ordinance made a difference, and more than 45 cities have since followed suit.\n\n\u201cWe saw a decrease in the number of new loans, in the number of refinances, in the dollar amount of new loans,\u201d Ayers told a city council committee. \u201cThe amount of fees decreased and the total number of vehicles repossessed also went down.\u201d\n\nNow, Ayers says those same payday loan companies are offering risky and unregulated new loan products, called signature loans or personal loans.\n\nLast year, Attorney General Ken Paxton wrote in an opinion that the new loans are legally different than payday loans. That means the city\u2019s guard rails don\u2019t apply to signature or personal loans, and they\u2019re completely unregulated by the state.\n\nBut Ayers said signature loans are often sold by the same stores that sell payday loans. The companies that make the loans often require authorization to take money from a borrower\u2019s bank account at a later date, the same as a payday loan.\n\nSome contracts will even include fine print specifying that the signature loan is not a payday loan, Ayers said.\n\n\u201cThough they say it in print, they have the practice of doing just that. That creates a problem and a cycle of debt where borrowers are unable to pay the loan off, and that just puts them further and further behind,\u201d she said.\n\nAyers is part of a group of faith leaders in Dallas calling for a new ordinance that would apply guard rails to signature loans.\n\nRev. Gerald Britt from the Anti-Poverty Coalition of Greater Dallas told members of the city council time is of the essence, with an eviction moratorium set to expire by the end of the year.\n\n\u201cDuring this age of COVID, we have residents who are particularly financially vulnerable, and who may fall pray to this predatory industry,\u201d Britt said.\n\nThe city of Austin tried to expand its payday loan ordinance to include personal and signature loans. It\u2019s currently fighting a lawsuit from the industry that wants it overturned.\n\nThe Dallas City Council could take up a similar ordinance as early as January.\n\nGot a tip?

The Nancy Best Fountain will be located at the Pearl Street entrance of the Park. Designed by Los Angeles-based Fluidity Design Consultants, it features a central island of three stainless steel \u201ctrees\u201d from which water will pulse and soar to heights of more than 55 feet in the air.\n\nAt the base of the fountain, children and adults are welcome to frolic in the shallow, highly reflective pool, turning Klyde Warren Park into one of the largest and most beautiful free water parks in Texas, according to a news release.\n\n\u201cThe only way to describe this fountain is spectacular,\u201d said Jody Grant, chairman of the board of the Woodall Rodgers Park Foundation. \u201cIt will truly be unlike anything seen before. When you look at aerial photos of Dallas in the future, we firmly believe this is the \u2018blimp shot\u2019 you will see. It will be a signature structure that by day beckons children at play and by night delights visitors with a spectacular show, reminiscent of the Eiffel Tower light show in Paris.\u201d\n\nDesign of the fountain is currently underway, with installation starting this summer. The Nancy Best Fountain is anticipated to be completed by December 2021.\n\n\u201cNancy Best has been a tireless advocate of the Park since its inception,\u201d said Sheila Grant, Klyde Warren Park co-founder. \u201cHer giving spirit and commitment to create a beautiful, perfect communal space for all of Dallas have long been a force behind the Park\u2019s success. When Nancy called and said she and Randy wanted to underwrite the fountain\u2019s construction, we were thrilled, but not entirely surprised because Nancy puts the Park and this city first. That she would offer such an incredible gift to our citizens in a year filled with so many challenges\u2026 well, that\u2019s just Nancy.\u201d\n\n\u201cSheila and I have talked and dreamed about a signature fountain for years,\u201d said Nancy Best. \u201cThe water features we currently have are some of the most used and beloved parts of the Park. In fact, one local publication named Klyde Warren Park one of the area\u2019s top five water parks, and this will take that distinction to a whole new level. Klyde Warren Park has been a labor of love for both Randy and me. It\u2019s a great honor and privilege to make this gift, and we hope it will spur others to do what they can, whether it be via donation, volunteering or simply a random act of kindness, to continue to make our city a place we can all be proud to call home.\u201d\n\nThe Nancy Best Fountain is part of the Park\u2019s ambitious Phase 2.0 project, which already includes: 1.7 acres of new park, featuring even more space for programming and events.\n\n\u2022 An expanded Children\u2019s Park, enhanced with a myriad of new features.\n\n\u2022 An enlarged My Best Friend\u2019s (dog) Park, relocated across the street to a shadier space.\n\nPlease leave this field empty Oh hi there \ud83d\udc4b It\u2019s nice to meet you.

They own a home-run dog breeding business, inspired by her son, that has been gaining traction. The Laster family has big plans to move their venture to a larger facility they believe will spur economic growth in South Dallas.\n\n\u201cWe had already started looking into having a dog breeding business because we had bought female rottweilers to start breeding, because that\u2019s [my son\u2019s] passion,\u201d Laster explains. \u201cBut then we had started watching dogs at home last summer, and he had more dogs than we needed to have \u2014 like, I had to start giving him a limit.\u201d\n\nSouth Dallas was at the top of Laster and her family\u2019s list as they searched for a location for a doggy day care facility. They hope to change the neighborhood\u2019s business landscape by opening a business that accepts unwanted dogs and also hires people with a criminal history struggling to find employment.\n\n\u201cWe want to be in South Dallas,\u201d Laster says. \u201cWe want to be close to our home, we want to stimulate the economy, I want people to work that may have a background that, maybe they were in trouble with the law, but nothing that they can\u2019t be rehabilitated.\u201d\n\nOver the last few months working from home and having more time on their hands, courtesy of the current COVID pandemic, Laster and her family began their search for leasing opportunities. They were turned down by their first prospective site, but then Laster came upon a family-owned business looking to lease part of its 44,000 square foot building on Logan Street. The owner was very supportive, Laster says, and the only thing standing in the way of the Laster family and their doggy daycare business was zoning.\n\nWhat is zoning, and why does it exist?\n\nThe entire City of Dallas is divided into zoning districts that determine where homes, industrial uses, stores and other uses can exist. The general purpose of zoning is to ensure that a city will grow and evolve in a way that benefits the general public\u2019s safety and wellness. The zoning process in the City of Dallas operates out of the sustainable development and construction department in Dallas\u2019 current planning division.\n\nAs required by the zoning process, if you want to develop land, you must obtain proper zoning prior to starting construction. If the land doesn\u2019t already meet proper zoning requirements, the owner must file an application for a zoning change for the proposed development. The three types of zoning changes are: 1) general zoning change; 2) planned development district (PDD); and 3) specific use permit (SUP), each with their own processes and requirements.\n\n[Read the Inclusive Community Project\u2019s guide to Planned Development Districts (PDDs).]\n\nEach zoning proposal lasts approximately 10-14 weeks from filing the application to City Council approval, according to the City of Dallas\u2019 zoning change information packet. The process includes two public hearings where people can speak for or against a zoning change, first to the City Plan Commission, whose commissioners are appointed by the City Council, and then to councilmembers themselves.\n\nRezoning for a doggie daycare\n\nLaster\u2019s first step was contacting the city to see if the property\u2019s zoning for industrial improvement uses could be changed to commercial improvements, allowing for a doggy daycare with grooming, boarding, training and other pet services.\n\n\u201cI first reached out to a city employee to ask, could this be rezoned? What did they think?\u201d Laster says.\n\nThe response was not what she had expected. Recalling the experience as \u201cdiscouraging,\u201d Laster says the city employee told her the city would not support her proposal for rezoning.\n\n\u201cSo if somebody said that to you who works for the city, and you\u2019re a mere mortal, what would you do?\u201d Laster says. \u201cYou would say, OK, let me go find another spot.\u201d\n\nDespite there being plenty of other warehouses available for lease in places like the Design District or Oak Cliff, Laster says she wanted her business to stay in South Dallas because there aren\u2019t many like it in the neighborhood.\n\nCity Councilman Adam Bazaldua, whose District 7 encompasses South Dallas, says this is no coincidence, as many neighborhood residents are spending their money elsewhere in neighboring areas.\n\n\u201cWhat we have become somewhat complacent to is that demand is poached out of our community and the money is spent in other communities,\u201d Bazaldua says.\n\nAfter Laster received the discouraging email from the city staffer, she immediately contacted Bazaldua, who is her councilman.\n\n\u201cI asked my council person to meet with me at the location to see what he thought, and he did,\u201d Laster says. \u201cAnd he looked around and he said, \u2018This is a perfect spot and we have a lot of things developing and coming.\u2019 \u201d\n\nEntertainment venue on Malcolm X Boulevard\n\nIn fact, nearly a year ago, Irving resident Adina Starke requested a zoning change that would allow her to convert her photography studio on Malcolm X Boulevard in South Dallas to an entertainment venue.\n\nStarke\u2019s Enchantment Designs studio is right across Malcolm X from Aunt Irene\u2019s Kitchen. The COVID-19 pandemic slowed down her zoning timeline, and though she filed her application in November 2019, she didn\u2019t present her proposal to the Dallas Plan Commission until June 2020.\n\n\u201cI would like to expand to include small events \u2014 private celebrations, bridal showers, baby showers, networking events, business trainings, things of that nature,\u201d Starke told the commissioners. \u201cI think it would be a good opportunity for the community for local residents to use this space.\u201d\n\nHer property\u2019s neighborhood commercial zoning wouldn\u2019t allow for such uses, so Starke requested a change to community commercial zoning. But Gwendolyn Satterthwaithe, the owner of the property next door, expressed concern that such zoning would allow for uses such as an adult cabaret or dance hall, \u201cwhich would be objectionable and have a detrimental impact,\u201d Satterthwaithe told commissioners.\n\nStarke assured both Satterthwaithe and the commissioners that \u201cwe do not have anything planned that would be detrimental to your building,\u201d and would prevent parking or littering on neighboring sites.\n\n\u201cWe want to ensure that we have a positive image in the neighborhood and, of course, to our neighbors,\u201d Starke said.\n\nIn the end, the plan commission, and later the city council, approved Starke\u2019s rezoning with conditions. The special use permit prohibits an adult arcade, adult cabaret, adult theater, billiard hall, bowling alley, motor track or skating rink. None of these were among Starke\u2019s business plans, but zoning sets standards for not just current but also future owners. The approval also included deed restrictions such as a solid screening fence maintained along the northern property line and business operating hours from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., Sunday through Thursday, and 8 a.m. to 1 a.m., Friday and Saturday.\n\nRolling out the welcome mat to small businesses\n\nCommissioner Timothy Jackson, whom Bazaldua appointed to the plan commission, noted that he didn\u2019t even know Starke\u2019s business existed in the community.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important to welcome businesses like this to the area,\u201d Jackson said, as he moved to approve Starke\u2019s proposal. \u201cIn South Dallas, we definitely need more businesses like this.\u201d\n\nBazaldua says Starke\u2019s entertainment venue will be an asset to the community because an entertainment venue like that doesn\u2019t currently exist.\n\n\u201cThe more things that we bring in that keep our residents in our community spending their money here, the more we create that ecosystem of a sustainable economy that is going to give back to this community, instead of all of our dollars being spent elsewhere,\u201d Bazaldua says.\n\nThat\u2019s one reason Laster kept working toward a South Dallas site for her doggy day care. Because she had no prior experience with the zoning process, Laster sought advice from a zoning consultant she knows. He adamantly advised her against pursuing the zoning change, warning of the painstaking work ahead.\n\n\u201cHe said, the city of Dallas is the worst place if you don\u2019t know what you are doing. For a small person like you, you\u2019re going to spend a lot of money and you might end up not having anything,\u201d Laster recalls.\n\nLaster says her zoning proposal is still in the permitting phase. She turned in her documents two months ago, but has yet to receive any correspondence from the city. She later discovered the department lost her paperwork.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had over 30 communications trying to get them to respond to me, trying to get help,\u201d Laster says. \u201cI didn\u2019t get any help until I got [Councilman] Adam [Bazaldua] involved, and I shouldn\u2019t have to do that because the average person does not know to get your council person involved.\u201d\n\nNative plant nursery backing up to the Great Trinity Forest\n\nThe experience was quite different for Lake Highlands resident Evo Sadowsky. She wants to open a native plant nursery on Pemberton Hill Road, just outside South Dallas near the River Ranch at Texas Horse Park. Sadowsky says the city was \u201csurprisingly helpful\u201d when she submitted her proposal to change the zoning for three vacant lots from residential to commercial retail.\n\n\u201cEverybody always complains about working with cities, but I will say they exceeded my expectations,\u201d Sadowsky says. \u201cWhen I first met with them, they sat down with us, let us ask all of our questions, and they weren\u2019t annoyed or short with us \u2014 they were very open and helpful.\u201d\n\nSadowsky hopes to expand her longtime family-owned business, Blue Ribbon Lady Landscaping, with a garden store, nursery and space for educational workshops that she wants to be a resource for the area.\n\n\u201cI think the people there can really benefit from the products and services that I\u2019ll have, and I think I could really benefit from being there in turn,\u201d Sadowsky says. \u201cIf it makes sense to be in south Dallas and revitalize one little corner of it, then that\u2019s kind of an added perk.\u201d\n\nBazaldua describes the zoning process as a complicated one but also believes that there are ways for residents to educate themselves on the topic.\n\n\u201cZoning is a very intricate subject, and it\u2019s one that I am still learning,\u201d Bazaldua says. \u201cI believe that, a lot like familiarizing yourself with city council by tuning into meetings, doing the same with the city planning commission and hearing how the processes go would be helpful.\u201d\n\nResidents also have a chance to speak in opposition or support whenever a zoning proposal comes up, even if they don\u2019t live near the property where the zoning change is being proposed.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re in the immediate vicinity of a certain notification range, you will have gotten a ballot that you have the opportunity to give feedback of opposition or support,\u201d for the proposal, Bazaldua says. \u201cBut then if you are not, you have the opportunity to come and speak at city council. You also have that opportunity with the people from the plan commission, not only through their meeting but also community meetings.\u201d\n\nZoning toward a better business ecosystem\n\nLaster and Sadowsky both strongly advise anyone preparing to enter the zoning process to surround themselves with supportive people.\n\n\u201cI just needed somebody to say, \u2018You\u2019re doing great, we have this done, all we need to do is this,\u2019 and kind of keep me on schedule,\u201d Sadowsky says. \u201cMy biggest bit of advice would be to get a support system of people who are actually committed to helping.\u201d\n\nLaster says her process was mostly discouraging but her interaction with Bazaldua was motivating.\n\n\u201cHonestly, the most beneficial thing that I had \u2014 and it was the only thing that kept me going \u2014 is that you gotta involve your council person,\u201d Laster says. \u201cThat would be my best advice \u2014 get your council person and your district planner involved.\u201d\n\nBazaldua believes South Dallas needs a zoning review and updates so that small business owners won\u2019t have to fight or go through an expensive and lengthy process to be able to open a business that the neighborhood would welcome. Zoning can protect residents from undesirable and harmful uses, but land that is inappropriately zoned creates barriers for people who lack the funds and know-how.\n\nAppropriate zoning \u201cis the ultimate goal,\u201d Bazaldua says, \u201cso that it is a more streamlined, smoother process for small business owners.\u201d", "title": "Zoning vs. small business: Three South Dallas stories", "dataset": "['manual_google_by_location']", "labels": "['employment']", "annot_city": "['Dallas']"}, {"id": 8760, "city": null, "url": "https://www.dallasnews.com/news/crime/2020/12/02/passer-by-finds-homicide-victim-under-bridge-in-northeast-dallas-police-say/", "text": "Dallas police are investigating after a man was found slain over the weekend in northeast Dallas.\n\nAuthorities were called about 11:45 a.m. Saturday to the 4400 block of the Matilda Bridge, near East Mockingbird Lane and Greenville Avenue, where a passer-by walking his dog found a body under the bridge, police said.\n\nIt appeared the man had been homeless, and the body was in a state of decomposition, according to police.

One positive trend was an increase in new leases and pre-lease transactions for large and mid-size office users.\n\nNotable leases include private mortgage lender Caliber Home Loans taking 159,320 square feet at Cypress Waters in Coppell and Haynes and Boone, DFW\u2019s largest corporate law firm, signing a pre-lease deal for 124,000 square feet at Harwood No. 14 in Uptown.\n\nNew office construction is down slightly, with 5.82 million square feet currently under construction.

Washington High School for the Performing and Visual Arts, and Booker T. graduate Singh, 18, a freshman at Yale University, are among 12 winners of the 2020 Musical Theater Songwriting Challenge, a program of the National Endowment for the Arts and American Theatre Wing.\n\nTheir original songs were selected in September from nearly 200 spring submissions \u2014 the only two winners from the same state, let alone the same high school.\n\nNurturing the next generation of musical theater songwriters in a pandemic has looked a little different from the previous two years of the blind competition, which started in 2016 as a pilot program in Dallas and two other cities before going national.\n\nEach young artist was paired virtually with a professional musical theater mentor and music director to fully orchestrate their original songs into Broadway-ready compositions.\n\n\u201cIt was definitely a Cinderella moment, like the girl in the raggedy dress to the full-on ball gown,\u201d says Singh, who is studying music and psychology at Yale. \u201cMy song is a professional piece of work that I\u2019m so proud of writing.\u201d\n\nSingh spent a Zoom-filled November Saturday in her New Haven, Conn., dorm room, overseeing the rehearsals and live-streamed recording of \u201cLove in the Scene,\u201d which tells the story of an aspiring actress pursuing a career in theater against her father\u2019s wishes.\n\nSoleil Singh (lower right), in her New Haven, Conn., dorm room, watches the recording of her winning song, \u201cLove In the Scene,\u201d via Zoom from Reservoir Studios in New York City.

(Natalie Powers)\n\nIn New York City\u2019s Reservoir Studios, the \u201cquirky, fun\u201d piece, first written two years ago in Singh\u2019s Southlake bedroom, came to life through the live sounds of piano, drums, an electric guitar solo and the lead vocals of Cathy Ang, the voice of Fei Fei in Netflix\u2019s upcoming animated movie-musical Over the Moon.\n\nPagaduan\u2019s song, \u201cLeft-over Love,\u201d is the story of an optimistic teenage girl in love with a boy who only wants to be friends.\n\nThe Rockwall teen \u201chas such a strong sense of herself as a composer and artist,\u201d says mentor Masi Asare, a composer, lyricist and book writer. As the two worked through the lyrics line by line, Pagaduan was encouraged to envision the song in a broader way to live in a theatrical context, while still staying true to the story.\n\nHolding firm in your vision, particularly as a female artist, is an important skill, says Asare, who divides her time between New York and the Chicago area, where she is an assistant professor of theater at Northwestern University.\n\n\u201cPart of what has been so joyful for me is the hope Xyzsa has,\u201d Asare says. \u201cIt\u2019s been inspiring for me to work with someone who is at the outset of her career, and there is so much talent.\u201d\n\n\u201cLeft-over Love\u201d features an all-female, six-piece band of musicians with Broadway credits such as Hamilton and Aladdin, and the voice of Filipino-American actress and singer Lianah Sta. Ana.\n\nThe two young artists connected on FaceTime the night before the recording session, sharing \u201cour culture and musical experiences outside of this one project,\u201d Pagaduan says.\n\n\u201cIt was inspiring to see a girl who looks like me, out there, pursuing music and thriving,\u201d Pagaduan says.\n\nBooker T. principal Scott Rudes spoke with pride about the two young women\u2019s achievements. \u201cTheir talent and initiative embody the very best qualities of BTW students. We know that they will take what they have learned here and change the world through their artistry.\u201d\n\nBoth Pagaduan and Singh say the collaborative experience has empowered them to be bold in their choices and find their voice through the stories they craft in ways they never imagined.\n\n\u201cIt is so much fun to be an artist, to listen to music, to write, to sing, to act,\u201d Singh says.\n\n\u201cThis experience has reminded me of why I\u2019m doing this in the first place \u2014 because of my passion for creating.

Despite the pandemic, opportunities exist for entrepreneurs in Dallas but Dallas can and must do more to help startup companies.\n\nHistorically, Dallas has thought of supporting entrepreneurism as a collection of grants and bank loans to new businesses, a very piecemeal, case-by-case approach that lacks a broader vision and ancillary support. The entrepreneurial vision has to be broader and embrace a cultural change that assesses opportunities, risks and growth potential.\n\nWithout a doubt this is a huge challenge for the task force led by local entrepreneurs Trey Bowles and Mandy Price, who are on a tight April 30 deadline to deliver workable recommendations to Johnson and councilman Tennell Atkins, who chairs Dallas City Council\u2019s economic development committee.\n\nOur advice to the task force is to urge City Hall to think more like entrepreneurs and evaluate existing policies through the lens of whether these generate and sustain business startups and companies that are poised to move to the next stage of development. This means reducing regulations that pose unnecessary obstacles to small business creation, and moving with the speed and purpose that businesses need in a dynamic economy.\n\nThen we would urge the task force to find mechanisms that would more aggressively encourage independent suppliers, universities, venture capitalists and others to be part of this paradigm. A key to growth is having a stable of core companies, universities, human capital, investment capital and mentoring networks pulling in the same direction. Although various incubator projects are underway in the region, most lack a unifying thread to jobs and business creation.\n\nDallas has an impressive number of Fortune 500 companies, whose decision to locate their headquarters in the region has created jobs, personal income and dynamic growth. But Dallas also must encourage an environment that promotes innovation and gives small businesses and folks with new ideas greater opportunities to be successful here.\n\nWhen times are difficult it is tempting to wish for a return to what we knew as normal. But \u201cnormal\u201d had not worked for many underserved neighborhoods in Dallas, and the pandemic has heightened their pain.\n\nWe hope the task force will address these inequities, take full measure of local assets available to rebuild a healthy, successful economy, and signal that normal is no longer good enough. Competition for ideas and human capital can land in Austin, Plano or anywhere in the world, either virtually or physically, and not in Dallas if the environment is better elsewhere. Our citywide response must focus on investing in human capital \u2014 whether it is a tech lab or in the creative small businesses on Main Street \u2014 because human capital creates wealth, jobs and productivity.\n\nEven before the pandemic, businesses large and small faced new market challenges. For Dallas to emerge on the other side of this pandemic, opportunities for innovation must not become casualties of the virus or old thinking.\n\nGot an opinion about this issue?

The results included repaired sidewalks, new streetlights and community gardens.\n\nToday, New York City, Denver, and Boston are among the U.S. cities making use of participatory budgeting. In Philadelphia, the City Planning Commission and the city\u2019s budget office will lead the effort.\n\nPublic participation will determine only a tiny sliver of capital spending \u2014 Philadelphia spent $3.4 billion on its FY21 capital budget.

That man was a brother, an uncle, and a son and now his sister needs the public\u2019s help to find who killed her loved one.\n\nThe last few moments of Joey Toms\u2019 life were spent doing what so many Philadelphians have done.\n\n\u201cJust waiting, basically circling the block for a parking spot,\u201d Julie Toms, his sister, said.\n\nOn Oct. 28, around 11 p.m., two men approached Toms\u2019 idling white work van, opened fire, and then ran off. Toms hit the gas and then crashed near the 2400 block of South Bouvier Street in South Philadelphia. The 33-year-old was then rushed to Jefferson Hospital.\n\n\u201cThey had worked on my brother for two hours and that he had passed away,\u201d Julie said.\n\nThe news, of course, was devastating to Toms\u2019 younger sister Julie and the entire family. The toll was so stressful that she believes it led to the death of her other older brother, Jimmy Toms, just one month later.\n\n\u201cUntil you are cleaning your brother\u2019s blood off the van he was shot in, you don\u2019t realize the trauma that puts your family through,\u201d she said. \u201cFor Jimmy, it just became too much.

Shot at Cherry Street Pier, the show is definitely not your normal Zoom meeting, said Blue Stoop co-founder Emma Eisenberg.\n\nIt\u2019s being professionally produced by Aly Spengler, who Eisenberg described as \u201csomeone who really appreciates how to create a visual that feels engaging\u201d and brings community to the fore.\n\nPhiladelphia Poet Laureate Trapeta Mayson, one of 10 writers participating, chose to read \u201cPoem About My Rights\u201d by June Jordan.\n\n\u201cJune Jordan was known as a poet for the people because she captured the lives, experiences and voices of ordinary people,\u201d said Mayson, who lives in Germantown. \u201cI too strive to do that in my own work.\u201d\n\nTickets are available on a sliding scale from $20 to $100. There\u2019s also a free option for BIPOC attendees, meaning people who identify as Black, Indigenous and people of color. Proceeds will be used to continue paying Blue Stoop staff, to compensate visiting teachers and for a scholarship fund.\n\nThe collective launched in May 2018 when a group of Philly writers, including Eisenberg and co-founder Joshua Demaree, banded together to create an informal, accessible place for local authors to connect.\n\nMost of the organization\u2019s funding comes from events and classes, Eisenberg said, and a fraction from donors and grants. The collective employs five part-time staffers and has about 10 volunteer board members. It also makes a point to pay authors and experts featured in special events, and compensates guest instructors.\n\nWhen COVID came, the nonprofit felt the creative economy shakeups.\n\n\u201cThere were such massive cuts to the arts sector in [Mayor Jim Kenney\u2019s] most recent budget which were really disappointing and tough for the whole arts community in Philly,\u201d Eisenberg told Billy Penn.\n\nAs part of austerity measures to deal with a half-billion-dollar pandemic deficit, Kenney\u2019s 2021 budget eliminated the $3 million Philadelphia Cultural Fund, from which Blue Stoop had received grants.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve lost a good amount of revenue and money,\u201d Eisenberg said. But, she added, \u201cwhen we\u2019ve asked for money, there\u2019s been an amazing response.\u201d\n\nPrompted by the community, Blue Stoop has pivoted away from large-scale national author gatherings toward more localized events.\n\nMay brought the launch of Wednesdays on the Stoop, a weekly Zoom hosted members of the collective\u2019s community. The free event has been well attended, and garnered a loyal following, Eisenberg said, though it doesn\u2019t contribute directly to the organization\u2019s bottom line.\n\nThe pandemic did give a boost to another part of the enterprise. When classes moved from in-person to online, it increased accessibility to students beyond the city borders. Enrollment is now competitive, said Eisenberg, with classes filling up fast. The spring 2021 courses are $400, offer financial aid, and launch at the end of January.\n\nOverall, the literary community has been incredibly supportive, Eisenberg said, including the 10 writers featured in \u201cWords of Revolution.\u201d\n\nBest-selling writers like Brittany Cooper (\u201cEloquent Rage\u201d), Kiley Reid (\u201cSuch a Fun Age\u201d) and Eric Smith (\u201cDon\u2019t Read the Comments\u201d) agreed to participate at lower than usual rates, Eisenberg said.\n\n\u201cBrittany Cooper could sell out an auditorium on her own,\u201d she said, adding that Philly\u2019s high profile during the election and successful anti-Trump organizing likely bolstered the city\u2019s rep among some heavy hitters.\n\nBlue Stoop has a $5,500 fundraising goal for Saturday\u2019s event and has already hit 86% of its target. The other goal is less concrete: to get virtual party-goers to really relax after such a rough year.\n\n\u201cSo much of our lives are now participating in a Zoom while washing dishes,\u201d Eisenberg said. Saturday\u2019s virtual fundraiser is designed instead to be watched like a film.\n\n\u201cWe invite people,\u201d she said, \u201cto make this experience a time of rest and intention.\u201d", "title": "Philly authors holiday party: \u2018Words of Revolution\u2019 with Blue Stoop", "dataset": "['manual_google_by_location']", "labels": "['indirect_city_relation', 'not_sure']", "annot_city": "['Philadelphia']"}, {"id": 8770, "city": null, "url": "https://6abc.com/philadelphia-police-standoff-officer-under-fire-shooting-kyle-road-barricade/8483066/", "text": "PHILADELPHIA (WPVI) -- Philadelphia police are providing new information on a barricade situation that ended in an officer-involved shooting earlier this week.It happened on November 30 around 8:39 p.m. on the 3500 block of Kyle Road.Officers were called to the scene after complaints that 53-year-old Gregory Ogrod changed the locks to the property.When officers arrived at the home they were greeted by 55-year-old JayAnn Kinniry and were allowed inside the residence, according to police.

After a traffic stop, Black drivers are twice as likely to be searched but 35 percent less likely to be found with contraband.\n\nSo Thomas introduced the Driving Equality Bill, which will prohibit police officers from stopping anyone for minor traffic violations, such as tinted windows, broken headlights and taillights, blowing a stop sign, expired tags, and who knows what else, exactly. He and his co-sponsors \u2013 Councilmembers Katherine Gilmore Richardson, Maria Qui\u00f1ones-Sanchez, Kendra Brooks, Kenyatta Johnson, Bobby Henon, Jamie Gauthier, Helen Gym and Cherelle Parker \u2013 claim that the bill will promote public safety.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been pulled over more times than I can count and it never felt like it was keeping me or my community safer,\u201d Thomas said in a news release.\n\n\u201cWe need to improve police-community relations and, at a time of economic crisis, ensure that we are not wasting a single dollar of taxpayers\u2019 money.\u201d\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing. We already have a Motor Vehicle Code that deals with headlights, rear lights, turn signals, if your license plate is falling off, tinted windows, if your bumper is busted, and a litany of other problems that may be wrong with your car. In any number of cases, you could be pulled over.\n\nThe newly proposed modifications to the City Traffic Code are so long and convoluted they remind me of a chart I once saw of someone trying to make sense of a Brexit flowchart.\n\nThomas\u2019 Chief of Staff, Max Weisman, told me that Council, on its own, doesn\u2019t have the power to change the state vehicle code but that\u2019s not what they\u2019re trying to do anyway. He said what Council does have the power to do is change how Philly police enact it. He said that his boss is merely trying to \u201creally, tangibly, break-down racial barriers.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs a young Black man, [Thomas] fits the profile, but since being elected to office, it\u2019s changed that\u2026We saw the year that we had and he\u2019s been an advocate for police reform in a number of ways. This is very personal to him,\u201d said Weisman.\n\nMany times, a traffic stop results in police finding a lot more than they expected, and that is good for public safety, at large, if what they find takes something dangerous off the streets.\n\n\u201cA tinted window is still a motor vehicle code violation. We\u2019re just saying that instead of being pulled over, they could just send a citation in the mail the same as you would receive a parking ticket\u2026We see this as one tiny solution to a big problem.\u201d\n\nSo the police would issue a ticket for these minor infractions rather than pulling someone over. No one likes getting pulled over. I have been pulled over countless times. It sucks. It can ruin your day, your next 10 years, or your lifetime. But many times, a traffic stop results in police finding a lot more than they expected, and that is good for public safety, at large, if what they find takes something dangerous off the streets.\n\nVehicles that are unregistered, unlicensed, uninsured or otherwise illegal, should be off the road. They could be hazardous and cause accidents. I know, because I once drove one for way too long and the power steering failed, the timing belt snapped, and I was lucky enough to manhandle it onto the shoulder of I-676 before my 1990 Toyota Celica broke down and blocked traffic.\n\nPolice who are doing a good job should not be told they can\u2019t continue their work because of a few \u2013 yes, a few \u2013 bad actors. Police are trained to protect and serve \u2013 not to target individuals based on race. If they are doing that, they should be fired.\n\nRacial profiling exists, is a problem in our police department and has caused trauma for many Philadelphians. There\u2019s been plenty of debate whether police need better training, new criteria for hiring, or sweeping reform altogether. I don\u2019t know the answer, but shouldn\u2019t solving the problem and coming up with a solution fall in the hands of the police commissioner or the mayor to whom she serves? This is not a City Council issue.\n\nThe bottom line is this: Why create a new law that allows people to violate an existing one?

Extreme, oppressive, 89-degrees-in-the-middle-of-spring weather. It drove the Philadelphia Inquirer to deliver a rather impassioned sermon on the subject:\n\nThe sudden change in the weather yesterday came with unexpected severity upon our citizens, and its depressing effects were plainly visible. Those whose employments required active outdoor exertion were more particularly affected by it. Overcoats suddenly disappeared and lighter garments were in demand. \u2026 The effects of the intense heat were perceptible on the condition of horses employed in cars and other vehicles. The animals not having shed their winter coats suffered greatly from this unprecedented heat.\n\nHere in the 21st century, we\u2019re still talking about the weather with great verve (albeit with slightly less 19th-century newspaper flourish and focus on horses). And for good reason. This year has seen its fair share of weather of \u201cunexpected severity\u201d and \u201cdepressing effects\u201d: a derecho that killed three people in June; six inches of rain in July, producing flash floods; a tornado warning for Philly this week and an actual tornado in Montgomery County. Even the not-so-depressing 69-degree day on January 11th (the hottest ever on record for that date) deserves to be filed under unexpected.\n\nSo is this the new normal?\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is, it\u2019s getting hotter and wetter here,\u201d says Rachel Valletta, an environmental scientist at the Franklin Institute. Indeed, according to an analysis by the University of Massachusetts Amherst, since 1895, the average temperature in Pennsylvania has increased by 1.4 degrees Fahrenheit, and in 13 of the past 15 years, the average annual temperature has exceeded that of the annual average across the entire 20th century \u2014 a strong sign that temperatures in recent years have been historically hot and not just a fluctuation. From 1958 to 2012, the amount of rainfall coming from the very worst storms increased 71 percent, which is probably part of the reason your phone has been blowing up with flash-flood alerts over the past few years.\n\nOf course, the reason for this is well documented: climate change, caused by humans. Warmer temperatures mean the atmosphere can hold more moisture; more moisture means larger storms; after those storms, thanks to warmer temperatures, more evaporation takes place, which means more water in the atmosphere and resulting larger storms. And so the cycle goes.\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is, it\u2019s getting hotter and wetter here,\u201d says Rachel Valletta, an environmental scientist at the Franklin Institute.\n\nStill, there\u2019s a distinction between the day-to-day fluctuations of weather and the broader, decades-long shifts of climate. \u201cThink of weather fluctuations as playing out on a moving background,\u201d says Valletta. Any given weather event might be extreme and unrelated to the broader climate-change forces at play (example: 89-degree spring days in the 19th century). But when laid on top of that moving background of warming, weather events are getting, and will continue to get, worse.\n\nGenerally speaking, drawing causal conclusions is difficult. A series of studies of 2017\u2019s Hurricane Harvey, using sophisticated computer modeling, did find that climate change made the storm more likely, as well as about 15 percent worse than it would have otherwise been. But we often can\u2019t pin down which storms were caused or made worse by climate change and which were simply extreme weather that would have happened absent such change.\n\nWe do know this: According to the National Weather Service, there were 19 verified flash floods in Montgomery County from 2013 to 2015, none in 2016 and 2017, and then more than 20 in both 2018 and 2019. \u201cEven if we cannot definitely say that each of those is because of global warming, what we can say is that because the climate has already changed, because the temperature has already gone up, it is our expectation that events like these will become either more common or more intense,\u201d says UMass climate researcher Ambarish Kalmarkar.\n\nFor all the attention brought on by tornadoes, floods, and warm days in the winter, the biggest danger to Philadelphians will likely come from something else: heat waves.\n\nAdam Joseph, meteorologist at 6 ABC, tells a similar story about tornadoes. \u201cThis year is now in first place with 36 tornado warnings issued!!!!\u201d he writes in an email. \u201cLast year is now second with 32 issued and 2011 with [massive hurricane] Irene was 29. So we have indeed had a spike in tornado activity or severe storms within the last decade for sure.\u201d He suspects that warming during the colder seasons is producing more severe weather.\n\nFor all the attention brought on by tornadoes, floods, and warm days in the winter, though, the biggest danger to Philadelphians will likely come from something else: heat waves, which Valletta says are \u201cmuch more worrisome,\u201d in large part because certain neighborhoods in the city can be upwards of 20 degrees hotter than others \u2014 an inequity that falls along racial and economic lines. (In this magazine\u2019s November 2019 story on what cities can do to mitigate climate change, we suggested increasing tree canopies in these neighborhoods to combat this \u201curban heat island\u201d effect.)\n\nThat view is echoed by a new analysis from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which finds that when taking into account not just raw temperature but also other factors like income and race, Philadelphia is the single most at-risk county for heat waves in the entire country, facing an estimated eight deaths per year. In addition, FEMA deems Philly at \u201cvery high\u201d risk for tornadoes, with an estimated annual loss of seven lives in addition to $1.9 million in property damage. And FEMA\u2019s list of \u201cvery high\u201d risk indicators for Philly goes on: ice storms, riverine flooding, lightning, wind and winter weather. No wonder Philly ends up in the 99th percentile of risk nationwide for adverse weather.\n\nSo yes, maybe the weather here really is as bad as it seems.", "title": "Philly Weather Is Getting Warmer and Wetter.

Other goals are explained here.\n\nTuesday's legislation is not final, but could be brought for a first reading Dec. 3 and passed by Dec. 10, a spokesperson for Council President Darrell Clarke said.\n\nIf passed, the tax changes would begin Jan. 1, 2022. Revenue gained from the development tax and reducing the abatements would help pay back the $400 million in bonds.\n\n\"There is no time to wait. Poverty is growing. These needs are urgent. We need to act now to create a better, more equitable future for every Philadelphian, and everyone has to pay their fair share,\" Clarke said in a statement.\n\nThe city says the coronavirus pandemic exacerbated inequities in homeowners and renters across many neighborhoods. An info packet on the initiative says more than a quarter of Philly homeowners and nearly half of renters are cost burdened or \"house poor,\" meaning they pay a large chunk of their income \u2014 35% or more \u2014 in housing costs.\n\nMany homeowners lacked funds for necessary repairs to stay in their homes, and other households don't have the income needed to rent an apartment.\n\n\"These bills will help the city attack inequality \u2014 particularly among people of color \u2014 and provide more affordable housing,\" said Beth McConnell of the Philadelphia Association of Community Development Corporations.\n\nDeputy Mayor Anne Fadullon told Council the Kenney administration supports the package of legislation.\n\nHere we break down the proposed tax changes in more detail, explaining who would be affected, and how.\n\n1% tax on new construction\n\nCouncil projects that a 1% Development Impact tax on new residential construction will boost the city budget by $9 million to $11.7 million per year.\n\nThe bill says the tax would be paid in two installments: half at issuance of the building permit, and the other half when given a certificate of final inspection.\n\nA project like adding a new level or expansion to a building would also be subject to the tax, but day-to-day repair would not be. The bill directs the city Office of Property Assessment to work out which kinds of construction would be subject to the tax and which would not.\n\nSome construction representatives and real estate developers testified against the tax in the virtual meeting Tuesday, saying it would restrict growth in their industry.\n\nClarke, according to his spokesman, then recited the amounts of tax breaks real estate developers received from the Trump administration, the state and the city.\n\nIf the bills pass, commercial developers will have a 90% tax abatement for 10 years for new projects, instead of 100%. That change alone would generate $83 million, Council projects.\n\nThe 10-year tax abatement\n\nFor decades, owners of a new construction have received a 10-year property tax grace period on the building, meaning they only pay taxes on the land. When those 10 years are up, their checks to the city get much larger.\n\nThe city moved last year to phase out the tax abatement gradually, proposing to give new owners a full tax abatement in the first year, and then cutting their tax break by 10% each year until the resident is paying the full amount. That phase-out was scheduled to start Dec. 31, our partners at the Philadelphia Business Journal reported.\n\nBut City Hall wheeling and dealing pushed back the date of that phase-out. When the package of bills likely passes this month, that will allow for new construction owners who get in before Dec. 31, 2021 to have the full 10 years.\n\nA statement from Clarke's office said allowing the abatement to continue another year helped gather more support from real estate developers, and was seen as a tradeoff for the 1% construction tax.\n\nMany education advocates who spoke in the public comment portion of the meeting called for ending the 10-year residential tax abatement now. So did some councilmembers, including Jamie Gauthier, who said Philly had been \"providing generous subsidies to the real estate industry for many years now, preventing schools from accessing much-needed funds.\"\n\n\"We have been down this road before. Last year, after years of pressure from residents and advocates, Council reached a relatively conservative agreement to phase out the abatement over the course of 10 years. I see no reason to turn back on this now,\" Gauthier said in a statement. \"Our schools are facing yet another drastic budget shortfall due to COVID-19. Why would we sign up for anything that continues to divert money from our schools, even for 12 months?\"\n\nCouncilmember Helen Gym also said she did not support extending the abatement, highlighting in a Twitter thread how some longtime property owners faced tax hikes while new owners' taxes were abated.\n\nIt was for lifelong residents, seniors & others living on limited incomes who are subjected to the largest prop tax hikes in n'hoods where the tax abatement is used the most. It was for preservationists & housing advocates fighting for rehab & affordability. \u2014 Helen Gym (@HelenGymAtLarge) December 2, 2020\n\nA previous version of this story stated the 1% tax would apply to all construction.

This is good news, because Philadelphia students are often deprived of even basic educational necessities.\n\nInstead, the funding is earmarked for the most basic need of all: safe school facilities.\n\nThe White House Coronavirus Task Force reports from November paint a grim picture of the state of the pandemic in Pennsylvania.\n\nStudents should not have to depend on charitable handouts just to learn in a safe building. And while every dollar counts, these funds will be insufficient to achieve even this most basic promise. Estimates have put the cost of bringing Philadelphia school buildings up to code at around $4.5 billion .\n\nThe White House Coronavirus Task Force reports from November paint a grim picture of the state of the pandemic in Pennsylvania.\n\nAnd this isn't just a Philadelphia problem. A 2014 school facilities study of roughly 1,194 of the 3,100 public school buildings in the Commonwealth found that 66 percent of them were constructed before 1970, making it likely that they contain asbestos.\n\nMeanwhile only a fraction of schools in the Commonwealth have been tested for lead as our state testing program is entirely voluntary.\n\nStill, during the 2018-19 school year, more than 100 school buildings in 32 Pennsylvania school districts that voluntarily tested were found to have drinking water with unsafe levels of lead. These schools were located in rural, suburban, and urban areas all across Pennsylvania.\n\nIt doesn't have to be this way. Schools would not have to depend on charity if the Commonwealth adequately funded public education, including funding existing programs specifically designed to address school maintenance. Last year, with the enactment of Act 70 of 2019, the General Assembly created a new Maintenance Project Grant Program (MPGP) within the long-established approach to state reimbursements for school construction, known as PlanCon.\n\nUnder the new MPGP, school entities could be reimbursed by the state for projects related to health and safety upgrades, including emergencies related to asbestos and lead.\n\nIn a recent report from Research for Action, State Funding to Ensure Safe and Healthy Facilities: Lessons for Pennsylvania, we found the that MPGP program was similar to programs in our neighboring states.\n\nSo, if we have a solid program to help Pennsylvania school districts already established in state law, what's the problem?\n\nThe problem is that the General Assembly created the program but has refused to fund it. The legislature has not provided any funding for the MPGP, and it has instituted a moratorium for several years on all new PlanCon applications for school construction reimbursements.\n\nOne might think that school buildings free from environmental hazards like asbestos and lead would be guaranteed to all students in Pennsylvania; especially since our state constitution requires the General Assembly to \"provide for the maintenance and support of a thorough and efficient system of public education to serve the needs of the Commonwealth.\"\n\nBut Pennsylvania's policymakers are not providing \"maintenance and support\" to keep students and educators safe and healthy. Apparently, the legislature does not believe safe school buildings are one of the \"needs of the Commonwealth.\"\n\nOur full report includes additional recommendations for how Pennsylvania can improve PlanCon and the MPGP. For now, many of Pennsylvania's school children must rely on insufficient handouts for insufficiently safe school buildings.\n\nMark Duffy is a Senior Research Associate, and David Lapp is the Director of Policy Research, at Research for Action, a Philadelphia-based education research organization.\n\nThis story was originally published by the Pennsylvania Capital-Star.

On some days, the hundreds of sites supplied by the country's largest food bank collectively get 1 million pounds.\n\nAmong the ranks of recipients is unemployed construction worker Herman Henton, whose wife is a home improvement store worker and now the sole breadwinner for their family of five. They tried to get food stamps but were told they only qualified for $25 of federal food assistance monthly.\n\n\u201cAs a man, as a father, as a provider I felt at a low point. I felt low,\" Henton said as he waited in his car near West Houston Assistance Ministries, which gets food from the Houston Food Bank for its care packages aimed at helping feed families for a week. \"In this type of situation there\u2019s nothing you can really do.\u201d\n\nDistributions by the Houston Food Bank now average about 800,000 pounds (363,000 kilograms) daily after reaching the unprecedented 1 million pound mark for the first time in the spring, a level that the organization still delivers periodically.\n\nBefore the coronavirus struck, the group's average daily distribution was 450,000 pounds (184,000 kilograms), said Houston Food Bank President Brian Greene.\n\nThen workers in Houston and millions around the country were suddenly thrown out of work and forced to rely on the handouts.\n\n\u201cIt had that feeling of a disaster, like the hurricanes in the Gulf,\u201d Greene recalled. \u201cIt was shocking how the lines exploded so quickly.\u201d\n\nAlmost overnight, one of America's most ethnically and racially diverse cities became a symbol of a desperate need as the food bank scrambled to take in enough milk, bread, vegetables and meat from multiple sources to feed the hungry.\n\nMany people in Houston and around the U.S. live paycheck to paycheck and were caught off guard by the economic fallout from the coronavirus that initially cost the nation 22 million jobs, with10.7 million that haven't come back.\n\n\"Forty percent of households have less than $400 in order to weather a storm,\u201d Greene said, referring to a Federal Reserve survey. \u201cSo, when this crisis hit the number of families who needed assistance was immediate and very large.\u201d\n\nAfter Henton was laid off, he and his wife ate one meal daily so their three children could have all three.\n\nHis family is one of about 126,500 that the Houston Food Bank has helped with boxes of food every week since March via its system powered by workers and volunteers who sort, box and pack the food onto trucks that deliver their loads to distribution centers throughout greater Houston's suburban sprawl.\n\nNationwide, the charitable food distribution \"surge has stayed at a surge level,\u201d said Katie Fitzgerald, executive vice president and chief operating officer of Feeding America, a national network of 200 food banks.\n\nHer group boosted the amount of food it distributes to 2 billion pounds (907 million kilograms) from April through June, up from 1.3 billion pounds (590 million kilograms) during the January-March period.\n\nThe federal government has helped meet demand with programs such as one that buys farm goods like vegetables, meat and dairy originally produced for now shuttered restaurants and gives it free to food banks and the distribution groups they work with.\n\nBut the money set aside for the U.S. Agriculture Department's multibillion-dollar Farmers to Families program runs out at the end of October.\n\nIndividual food banks also get 20% to 40% of the food they distribute from other government programs, including one that helps farmers hurt by foreign tariffs by buying their produce, beef, pork and chicken and ensuring that producers get paid while edible food doesn't end up in landfills. That program is funded so far through 2020.\n\nThe food banks get the rest of what they distribute from supermarket or farmer donations or buy it with donated cash.\n\nFitzgerald said the nation's food banks have enough food to meet U.S. demand for now, but said distributors \u201care concerned about the future\u201d as winter approaches.\n\nDemand for food in the Houston area, long subjected to the volatility of the oil industry, will probably continue without more government relief for jobless workers, said Mark Brown, CEO of West Houston Assistance Ministries, which gives food to nearly 2,000 people each week.\n\n\u201cI think we will have an elevated need in our community for at least two years,\u201d he said.\n\nThe charity was founded in 1982 to help people during an oil bust that eliminated 225,000 jobs and toppled the city's real estate market. The group also helps people pay their rent and find work.\n\nOn one recent food distribution day, many people waiting in their cars with the tailgates open so bags could be easily loaded in their vehicles in a socially distant way were reluctant to speak about their economic misfortunes or other reasons for lining up.\n\nUnemployed stagehand Priscilla Toro said she was embarrassed at having to resort to the free food line but added: \u201cWe have to get by. We\u2019ve got to eat.\u201d\n\nHenton said he was simply thankful that he and many others can feed their families with the extra help.\n\n\u201cIt can happen to anyone,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nSnow reported from Phoenix.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nOn Twitter: twitter.com/asnowreports, twitter.com/JohnMone", "title": "Feeding Houston's hungry: 1M pounds of food daily for needy", "dataset": "['manual_google_by_location']", "labels": "['food', 'inequality']", "annot_city": "['Houston']"}, {"id": 8788, "city": null, "url": "https://communityimpact.com/houston/heights-river-oaks-montrose/parks-recreation/2020/11/03/city-announces-parking-security-plan-ahead-of-houston-open-at-memorial-park/", "text": "City and Houston Open officials announced the return of the golf tournament to Memorial Park for Nov. 5-8.

The new location will eliminate a couple of problems \u2014 navigating downtown traffic and searching for a place to park \u2014 and will likely raise the public profile of the endowment, long known as a backbone of the city\u2019s philanthropic community.\n\nThe new building will better accommodate modern work styles, with huddle rooms and meeting spaces and the kind of natural light that fuels the energetic staff of its president and CEO, Ann Stern.\n\nCreated in 1937 by entrepreneur Jesse Jones and his wife, Mary Gibbs Jones, the Houston Endowment is one of the city\u2019s oldest foundations and one of the country\u2019s wealthiest place-based endowments, with a current value of $1.87 billion.\n\nTo help For more information on Houston Endowment go to houstonendowment.org.\n\nRead More\n\nEach year, the endowment distributes $100 million to nonprofits that are here or benefit people who live here. Residents may frequently hear of new grants or donations they\u2019ve made, but they\u2019ll never hear of a fundraiser, since the endowment was fully funded by the estate of the Joneses, which included his many business interests, including owning a majority share of the Houston Chronicle, which was sold to Hearst Corp. in 1987.\n\nJones believed that the people of Houston had helped him prosper, and he wanted his wealth to help create and nurture organizations that would, in turn, benefit the city and those who live here.\n\n\u201cHaving been here 84 years, we have a certain reputation, one of independence and objectivity,\u201d Stern said. \u201cMost people view us as having no other agenda than benefiting the people of Greater Houston.\u201d\n\nWhile there\u2019s virtually no sector of the city\u2019s nonprofit community that goes untouched by the endowment, its major focus is in two areas: prekindergarten through 12th-grade education and civic engagement and participation, with about half of its annual budget going to initiatives in those broad areas.\n\nThe remainder of its money goes to a vast lineup of nonprofits that include arts and culture, college scholarships, greenspace and parks, literacy, housing, homelessness, food assistance, domestic violence and mental health. And some money is always available for emergencies, such as disaster relief during 2017 and 2018 or today\u2019s coronavirus pandemic.\n\nWhile the dollars it puts into the community are meaningful, the money comes with the intellectual capital of the endowment\u2019s staff and important connections to others who can help with information or collaboration.\n\n\u201cWe ask what can we do that adds particular value?\u201d Stern said. \u201cWe almost never give only dollars. We give nonfinancial assets. People will call us and say, \u2018Will you convene a group to start exploring a particular issue?\u2019 We see people working on it and we pull them together in a way that\u2019s more efficient and more effective.\u201d\n\nOne example of that is when former Mayor Annise Parker launched a citywide effort to reduce the homeless population. Houston Endowment contributed about $15 million to that cause, Stern said, but also pulled together others who could be part of the solution.\n\nWhile homelessness will always be an issue, that collective effort was a success and made Houston a national example that other cities used as a model to address their own homeless problems.\n\nOn the education front, Houston Endowment and the Kinder Foundation contributed money for a new initiative \u2014 Good Reason Houston, which launched publicly in March 2019 \u2014 with a goal that every child attends a great school, with \u201cgreat\u201d being defined as schools scoring \u201cA\u201d or \u201cB\u201d in Texas accountability rating systems.\n\n\u201cEvery child in every neighborhood should have access to a world-class education because that will allow them to thrive, but only 21 percent attain that. For children of color, it\u2019s 10 to 15 percent, and for boys of color it\u2019s less than 10 percent. So you can see the disparities growing,\u201d Stern said. \u201cSome 265,000 children in Houston are learning in schools rated \u2018C,\u2019 \u2018D\u2019 or \u2018F.\u2019\u201d\n\nGood Reason Houston estimates that 70 percent of students are reading below grade level, and the city\u2019s average ACT score is significantly below the national average.\n\nAlex Elizondo is CEO of Good Reason Houston, the group that hopes to improve the quality of education by growing better schools. They help in whatever way school districts ask for help, she said. They improve teacher evaluation systems and assist with strategic planning, and shift top performing teachers and principals to low-performing schools in turn-around efforts.\n\nWhen they sought school districts interested in their help, Aldine ISD was one of several that raised its hand. There, they are using an extended-day schedule so students get more academic time in literacy and math. There\u2019s a focus on social and emotional development so children are in a safe environment where they can learn, and after-school activities such as sports or events bring in parents to engage in what their kids are doing.\n\nThey can see significant change within a couple of years, Elizondo said, and student test scores should improve in three to four years. Good Reason Houston\u2019s goal is that by 2025, 60,000 more children will be learning in top-rated schools.\n\n\u201cI thought it was going to be harder to build relationships with districts, but they know their jobs are really hard, and with COVID-19, it\u2019s even harder,\u201d Elizondo said. \u201cThey want skilled expertise with things they need help on. We come to them with shared goals and as problem solvers.\u201d\n\nAnother Houston Endowment-funded group is Houston in Action, which has been around for about two years. Executive director Frances Valdez brings together people and organizations to reduce systemic barriers to civic participation and to increase civic participation in communities that have been marginalized \u2014 young people, people of color and people living in poverty.\n\nOne project has been improving the 2020 Census Count, an effort hampered by the limitations of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\u201cThe Houston Endowment isn\u2019t just funding. Its program officers work with us and guide us and make introductions. Even in the relationships I\u2019ve built with local officials \u2014 everyone knows the endowment, and it is seen as a trusted partner,\u201d Valdez said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s endless, the amount of work that needs to be done. It isn\u2019t about a campaign or a political moment. It is about people, and this summer we saw the history of this country bubbling up \u2026 in racial tension,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have to undo all of the barriers that have been intentionally put in place to keep people from participating.\u201d\n\nThat opportunity is not lost on Stern. The endowment\u2019s funding process is nimble enough to assist with disaster relief after Hurricane Harvey or help out during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nWith racial injustice in the forefront, Stern is hopeful the endowment\u2019s dollars can make progress there, too.\n\n\u201cThe COVID-19 pandemic exposed so many of the frailties in our social safety net, whether it\u2019s education or health or housing or mental health. We do not want to miss this moment to talk about that and raise awareness about that,\u201d she said. \u201cThen layer George Floyd\u2019s murder and the awakening to the racial injustices that are structural across our communities and also having an impact there.\u201d\n\nSome $25 million will be deployed over three to four years to Black-led organizations that have been addressing these issues for a long time.\n\n\u201cThat is incredibly exciting for our staff. We see so much potential for impact because it intersects really beautifully with our civic engagement and participation work,\u201d Stern said.\n\ndiane.cowen@chron.com", "title": "Houston Endowment is a big backer of city\u2019s nonprofits", "dataset": "['manual_google_by_location']", "labels": "['philanthropy']", "annot_city": "['Houston']"}, {"id": 8792, "city": null, "url": "https://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/transportation/2020/09/04/381061/city-is-planning-major-changes-to-busy-southwest-houston-corridor/", "text": "The project is designed to enhance safety for pedestrians, cyclists and transit riders in a neighborhood where many people don\u2019t drive.\n\nPedestrians and cyclists in Houston\u2019s Gulfton neighborhood are invited to give input on safety improvements to Hillcroft Avenue.\n\nHouston Public Works has launched a survey to better understand safety concerns. City officials say the feedback will be used as designs are made for new sidewalks, safer crossings, access to public transit, protected bikeways and improved lighting.\n\nA 2018 study from Rice University's Kinder Institute found about a third of the streets in Gulfton didn't have sidewalks, while others were in poor condition.\n\nMany of the apartment complexes in Gulfton were built in the 1970s to house young professionals who moved to the city to work in the booming oil and gas industry. Like many neighborhoods with clusters of apartment complexes, they were designed primarily for cars.\n\nNow in 2020, Gulfton is home to many immigrant families who have come to Houston from all over the world. Many of those new residents get around by foot or by bus, but they're forced to negotiate a challenging landscape.\n\nOn Gulfton's commercial thoroughfares pedestrians have to dodge vehicles entering and exiting parking lots, like one mom who told us back in 2018 about a scary encounter she had while walking her kids home from school.\n\nTo remedy some of those issues, the City of Houston is finalizing design work on a series of improvements along Hillcroft. That project would extend from Bellaire Boulevard to the complex intersection at Westward Street and High Star Drive.\n\nFor one, the city wants to reduce traffic on Hillcroft from eight lanes to six. A new traffic signal at Dashwood Drive would also help slow down traffic. Other improvements include wider sidewalks, protected bike lanes and new crosswalks. Designs also include a pedestrian plaza on Hillcroft at High Star.\n\nSpeaking during an online public meeting about the project, Suzane Abedi with Houston's Complete Communities initiative said the Hillcroft project will allow everyone to use the road safely.\n\n\"The mayor emphasizes how we constantly need to strive for more equitable Houston and elevating communities that really, really require it,\" said Abedi.\n\nRight now Public Works is taking community input on the project. The city says it would like to start work this fall.\n\nSubscribe to Today in Houston Fill out the form below to subscribe our new daily editorial newsletter from the HPM Newsroom.

The city of Decatur and coastal Savannah improved their standing on the Human Rights Campaign's annual analysis after both passed local laws shielding their LGBTQ residents from work, housing and public accommodation discrimination.\n\nThe new local ordinances are part of a recent trend in Georgia, which does not bar discrimination at the state level. Nearly a dozen cities have passed their own local law in the last two years, including more conservative places like Dunwoody and Statesboro, and about a half dozen others may follow suit, according to the report. Advocates see the growing patchwork of local laws as part of a bipartisan push to convince Georgia lawmakers to pass a statewide discrimination ban. Lawmakers have historically resisted, but they did include sexual orientation in a hate crimes law that passed this year. Georgia had been one of four state without a hate crimes law.\n\nAtlanta, which passed its anti-discrimination ordinance two decades ago, again scored 100 on the advocacy group's Municipal Equality Index. Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, who recently hired the city's first director of LGBTQ affairs, said in a video statement Thursday that mayors and cities remain the \"first line of defense\" on equality.\n\n\"2020 has been a roller coaster year for everyone, including the LGBTQ community,\" said Bottoms, who is a prominent Georgia ally of President-elect Joe Biden. \"We saw the election of the most pro-equality presidential ticket in our nation's history and the affirming of the rights of LGBTQ people in the workplace.\n\n\"However, we also saw record high numbers of incidents and deaths for trans-Americans and recently a federal court overturned a life-saving conversion therapy ban,\" she added.

The handcuffs came off. Boston police Detective Robert Tully was going to get away with it.\n\nIt seemed like a clear-cut case of drunken driving: The motorist almost hit an MBTA Transit Police car on Route 3 and sped away. When the transit cop caught him, the driver allegedly smelled of liquor, acted belligerently, and threatened to sue.\n\nThird in an occasional series. Read part one and part two .\n\nBoston police sent three officers 15 miles south of the city to collect their man, who on that night in 2009 had recklessly and dangerously driven a department car, antagonized a transit cop, and tried to evade arrest, according to documents obtained by the Globe.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLater, the police report on the incident would be sealed. Potential criminal charges disappeared in a secret court hearing. There was no investigation, no discipline, no paperwork. Officially, it never happened.\n\nAnd so Tully was free to drink and drive and endanger again.\n\nAlmost five years later, just before Christmas in 2013, he was once again behind the wheel of an unmarked cruiser with alcohol on his breath when he crashed into a nurse driving home from work. The nurse, Danielle Coughlin, spent four days in the ICU with a broken sternum, a lacerated liver, and a head injury.\n\nAgain, Tully got away with it, thanks to Boston police, Boston City Hall, and the Rockland police, a coverup detailed in a Globe investigation published last month. He faced no consequences, remained on duty, and retired, in 2014, on his own timetable and with pension intact.\n\nNow, long-buried documents recently unearthed by the Globe detail the concealed 2009 case, making it clear that Tully has benefited from two police coverups, in 2009 and 2013. The documents illustrate how quickly law enforcement can close ranks, and just how broad \u2014 and lasting \u2014 the blue wall of silence can be.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWho\u2019s he going to hit next week? A family of four coming home?\u201d asked Coughlin, the nurse, when the Globe told her of Tully\u2019s 2009 brush with the law. \u201cIt\u2019s just disheartening. It\u2019s disgusting.\u201d\n\nTully declined through his attorney to comment.\n\nThe Globe report last month on how Boston police officers accused of crimes are often shielded from criminal or professional consequences drew expressions of concern but no sweeping action from Mayor Martin J. Walsh of Boston and his police commissioner, William Gross; both said officers should be held to the highest standards.\n\nThe tone shifted somewhat when the Globe asked this week about the 2009 incident and coverup. Gross said the department would immediately launch an investigation into the case and its handling.\n\n\u201cEvery person, regardless of their job, must be treated the same under the law,\u201d Gross said in a statement. \u201cThe alleged actions of Mr. Tully do not represent the Boston Police Department, and are unacceptable and unbecoming of an individual whose duty is to protect and serve.\u201d\n\nGross declined to be interviewed, as did the mayor. Walsh issued a statement, which did not mention Tully by name but said \u201cany officer who breaks the law and breaks their community\u2019s trust must be met with swift and thorough action.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe latest revelations about Tully drew outrage from Suffolk District Attorney Rachael Rollins, who has long pushed for greater police accountability and oversight.\n\n\u201cWhy are police officers allowed to be above the law? Because it is other police officers that make the decision as to whether or not they get arrested,\u201d Rollins said in a statement. \u201cIt is almost beyond belief that Boston police allegedly knew about this 2009 incident with Detective Tully and did nothing. But even more insulting and infuriating is that in 2013, in yet another driving episode, Detective Tully\u2019s BPD-issued vehicle crossed the center line and he seriously injured a woman.\u201d\n\nOthers said the findings underscore some of the systemic problems within policing across the nation.\n\n\u201cThe culture of that blue wall of silence actually damages communal trust,\u201d said the Rev. Willie Bodrick II, senior pastor elect at the Twelfth Baptist Church. \u201cTo the community, it seems like there is a different code and a different law and a different status of citizenship for those who are police officers.\u201d\n\nThe BPD declined to make Captain Wayne Lanchester, who as a lieutenant was the highest-ranking supervisor notified when Tully was stopped in 2009, available for an interview. The department and the city declined to answer specific questions about the case, and noted that it occurred under the previous administration. Former police commissioner Edward F. Davis said he did not remember this case, but said his administration did things \u201cby the book,\u201d and nobody got a pass.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTransit Police Chief Kenneth Green, whose agency\u2019s officers chased Tully in 2009, called the case concerning. He noted that because the officers involved have retired, the department is limited in its ability to conduct an investigation. Nonetheless, he ordered a review.\n\n\u201cTransit Police officers are expected to treat all citizens with the same discretion and fairness regardless of one\u2019s status or position,\u201d Green said.\n\nBecause Tully faced no consequences, he\u2019s a prime example of the high public cost \u2014 in pain and suffering, broken trust, and lifetime pension payments for offending officers \u2014 of a police culture that protects troubled cops.\n\nIf Tully had been treated like an ordinary citizen, and had been convicted in the 2009 case and the 2013 case, he could have lost his taxpayer-subsidized retirement. Instead, his record is clean. He has already collected more than $430,000, and the monthly checks will continue for the rest of his life.\n\n***\n\nBoston police Detective Robert Tully's chase by the Transit Police ended in this Home Depot Parking Lot on Jan. 22, 2009. John Tlumacki/Globe Staff\n\nAt around 10:25 p.m. on the night of Jan. 22, 2009, Transit Police officer Lawrence Culbert was headed south on Route 3 in Hingham in an unmarked Ford Expedition when a black Chevrolet Impala got so hot on his tail that he lost sight of the car\u2019s headlights. Culbert turned his blue lights on, and the Impala almost hit him, then sped off, according to documents obtained by the Globe.\n\nCulbert turned on his siren. The Impala repeatedly slowed down then took off again just as Culbert got close, once getting off the highway and stopping long enough for Culbert to jump out of his car before the other driver hit the gas.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Impala then pulled into a Home Depot parking lot. When Culbert caught up, he saw the Impala had turned around and was driving toward him, according to the documents.\n\nCulbert stopped his cruiser and jumped out to confront the other driver, who refused to identify himself. When Culbert told him he would be arrested, the driver allegedly began to drive away and Culbert yanked the man\u2019s arm out of the window and put him in a wrist lock.\n\nIt was then, while Culbert was putting the driver in handcuffs, that the police badge fell out of the driver\u2019s pocket. Culbert checked the man\u2019s ID: Detective Robert Tully. And Culbert learned soon enough that the Impala was a BPD vehicle, which had a department-issued Glock pistol in the trunk.\n\nCulbert didn\u2019t conduct a field sobriety test, according to the documents. Instead, he took off the handcuffs, notified his supervisor, and requested assistance from higher-ups from Transit and Boston police.\n\nTransit Police informed a Boston police lieutenant, and a sergeant and two officers responded to the scene, according to the documents.\n\nCulbert turned Tully, his car, and his gun over to the Boston officers, according to the documents. While he waited for his ride home, Tully urinated in the parking lot.\n\nCulbert wrote Tully two citations for a handful of civil and criminal motor vehicle infractions, including failure to stop for police \u2014 but nothing for drunken driving. Ultimately, the citations didn\u2019t matter. They disappeared in a clerk magistrate\u2019s hearing in Hingham District Court, according to the clerk\u2019s office, which has no records at all of the incident. No criminal charges were issued. The only entry on Tully\u2019s driving record from the incident is a civil citation for a signal infraction.\n\nCulbert did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nBoston police didn\u2019t open an internal affairs investigation against Tully, who was at the time listed as a director of his union, the Boston Police Detectives Benevolent Society, according to state records. The BPD didn\u2019t even stop Tully from driving a take-home city vehicle in the future.\n\n***\n\nThe failure to take the first incident seriously would clear the way for the next.\n\nOn Dec. 11, 2013, Tully was in his police department Honda when he swerved across the centerline on a residential road in Rockland. As the Globe reported last month, he slammed into Danielle Coughlin as she slowed her car to turn into her driveway, sending them both to the hospital. Medical records obtained by the Globe showed that Tully was slurring his speech and had alcohol on his breath. Nearly three hours after the crash, his blood alcohol level was still almost 2.5 times the legal limit.\n\nThe aftermath of a crash Dec 11, 2013, in Rockland that sent Danielle Coughlin to intensive care. Coughlin's Toyota RAV4 was hit just before midnight by a city-owned car driven by off-duty Boston police Detective Robert Tully.\n\nRockland police say they didn\u2019t notice. Despite pleas from Coughlin\u2019s father, the agency never tried to get Tully\u2019s blood alcohol test results from the hospital. The Rockland police chief said his department handled the crash correctly, and that only Plymouth District Attorney Timothy J. Cruz\u2019s office could request blood alcohol results.\n\nCoughlin\u2019s father called and asked the DA to do exactly that.\n\nThe Globe obtained e-mails through a records request that show Cruz\u2019s office briefly looked into the case a little more than a year after it happened.\n\n\u201cIt sounds like Rockland PD might have let this guy go despite the fact it could have been OUI, bc he\u2019s a Boston cop,\u201d read an internal e-mail sent Jan. 14, 2015. \u201cSo, we might get some resistance in getting the file initially.\u201d\n\nBut then the e-mails stop. Nothing ever happened.\n\nCruz\u2019s office redacted the names of the employees that sent and received the e-mails. In a statement, the office said they were powerless because Rockland police had failed to pursue criminal charges.\n\nTully\u2019s son, Brad Tully, briefly worked as a prosecutor for the Plymouth DA in 2010 and 2015. Brad Tully did not respond to requests for comment; the Plymouth DA did not respond to questions about whether his role in the office had any impact on the case.\n\nFor their part, Boston police did not open an internal affairs investigation into the 2013 crash for three years. By then, Tully had retired and was receiving his pension.\n\nThe BPD has said it relied on Rockland\u2019s report on the crash, which did not mention alcohol.\n\nWhen Coughlin tried to sue Tully in civil court, the city\u2019s law department falsely said he had been acting \u201cin the scope of his employment\u201d at the time of the crash. Payroll records show Tully had been off duty for almost eight hours. But the city\u2019s claim had the effect of protecting Tully from civil liability.\n\nCoughlin has tried to put the crash behind her, but she still suffers from chest pain, and anxiety while driving. She now wonders what might have been different if Tully had been charged and prosecuted in 2009. Would he still have hit her? Would she have made it home safely?\n\nShe\u2019s not surprised that police protected Tully years before she encountered him.\n\n\u201cIt just goes to show,\u201d she said. \u201cThey can do no wrong.\u201d\n\nEvan Allen can be reached at evan.allen@globe.com.

As Osgood said, bus infrastructure has been a focus of the city and the T because it\u2019s much cheaper and easier than adding train routes or capacity, for which major projects can cost in the billions.\n\nThe order approved by the council is for \u201cconstruction and implementation of dedicated bus lanes and similar bus priority measures in various locations within the City of Boston.\u201d Boston Transit Team Director Matt Moran said this money is supposed to last for two or three years of projects.\n\nA T spokesman insisted that this wasn\u2019t simply the cash-strapped transit agency dumping more money over to Boston \u2014 it\u2019s meant to be a different way of accounting for for the joint projects Boston and the MBTA have begun doing, as the T owns the buses and the Hub owns the roads.\n\nMBTA General Manager Steve Poftak said in a statement, \u201cThere are a number of opportunities that have great potential to improve daily bus service for tens of thousands of people. We look forward to working with the City of Boston to plan and implement more projects, pending public engagement processes. This funding agreement is a critical step in allowing us to deliver bus improvement projects in a timely and effective manner.\u201d\n\nThe city and the T have partnered to put in bus lanes on Brighton Avenue in Allston, Washington Street in Roslindale, and \u2014 in the uniquely Boston style of confusing roads \u2014 the city\u2019s other Washington Street in the South End. Officials said the next places the city\u2019s looking are Blue Hill Avenue in Mattapan, North Washington Street downtown, Hyde Park Avenue near the Forrest Hills T station and Columbus Avenue, Malcolm X Boulevard and Warren Street in Roxbury.\n\nThe T\u2019s currently eying significant service cuts after ridership plummeted during the pandemic, but Osgood said ridership has been more resilient on the bus system than the subways in general, and the lines they\u2019re focusing on for bus lanes are ones that have remained in demand.\n\nOsgood said he didn\u2019t believe there\u2019d been any instance when the city had started down the road toward adding a bus lane only to abort it due to community backlash. He said the city\u2019s first bus lanes have been in places where there\u2019s particularly high bus ridership, so it\u2019s generally been welcomed.\n\nMoran said it\u2019s not yet clear how many projects this new money will go toward funding, though for reference the Brighton Avenue project, which created less than a mile of bus lanes, cost $600,000. He said projects cost more when they require significant changes to the curbs, which Brighton Ave. did not.\n\nThe city officials insist that data shows these lanes improving bus service, regulating ride times. Moran said the Brighton Avenue bus lane has seen a 7-8% increase in ridership \u2014 though data is \u201cfuzzy,\u201d as it started amid the pandemic \u2014 and Roslindale lane, which is a bit older, has seen the higher outliers of commute times largely go away, and about 170 more passengers show up for the morning rush hour.\n\n\u201cIf you make the bus more reliable, then more people will be taking the bus,\u201d Osgood said.", "title": "Boston will have access to $30M in MBTA money for bus lanes", "dataset": "['manual_google_by_location']", "labels": "['transportation']", "annot_city": "['Boston']"}, {"id": 8803, "city": null, "url": "http://jamaicaplaingazette.com/2020/12/04/city-of-boston-to-offer-two-hours-of-free-parking-on-saturdays/", "text": "As a way to support Boston\u2019s small businesses during the holiday season, Mayor Martin J.

Durkan, City Council President M. Lorena Gonz\u00e1lez, Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda, and Councilmember Tammy Morales today announced a new $5 million relief package to support small businesses and workers impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. In response to recent statewide restrictions needed to slow the surge of COVID-19, the $5 million will be directed toward small businesses and workers in the hospitality industry. $2.5 million will be granted to restaurants and bars, and $2.5 million will be granted to hospitality workers. This budget action will be introduced and considered by the City Council on Monday, December 7.\n\n\u201cIn response to skyrocketing cases in our region and state, Governor Inslee rightly implemented statewide restrictions to curb indoor gathering and slow the spread of COVID-19. But there\u2019s no denying these restrictions have impacted our small businesses and workers, who have been reeling from the pandemic for almost a year now,\u201d said Mayor Durkan. \u201cThese emergency grants are intended to provide a lifeline to small businesses and workers most recently impacted. While these grants are a necessary aid, ultimately, real relief must come from the federal government. Congress must act next week to finally pass an overdue COVID-19 relief package. Every day they fail to act, more small businesses close their doors for good, and more workers lose their jobs.\u201d\n\n\u201cMembers of the restaurant industry and their families are carrying the heavy financial burdens of this pandemic. Many continue to face uncertainty about the long-term impacts to this industry. I am proud that here, in the City of Seattle, we are stepping up and working collaboratively to fund relief for this industry, at a time when expanded unemployment benefits are set to run out and relief from Congress is not immediately on the horizon,\u201d said Seattle City Council President M. Lorena Gonz\u00e1lez(Position 9, Citywide).\n\n\u201cWe know local governments that invest in standing up supports during economic downturns recover faster. While Seattle has invested millions of dollars in small business supports, we must do more to close funding gaps and invest further in our small businesses, especially as our city undergoes another round of COVID-related closures. What\u2019s best for our local economy, our working families, and our recovery is to ensure as many small businesses as possible are able to survive this pandemic and make it out to the other side,\u201d said Councilmember Teresa Mosqueda (Position 8, Citywide).\n\n\u201cPart of building community wealth is creating opportunities for small businesses to thrive in the places their owners and workers live. As another wave of COVID infections hits Seattle, we know some small businesses that barely survived the first shut down won\u2019t be able to this time. The demand for small business financial support is only increasing, and I\u2019m proud Seattle is meeting the challenge by investing another $5 million in aid. By prioritizing businesses in areas of high displacement, we\u2019re providing community members and business owners support to further avoid disaster gentrification,\u201d said Councilmember Tammy Morales (District 2, South Seattle and the C/ID)\n\nThe $2.5 million in new grants for small businesses will target restaurants and bars that have been financially impacted by COVID-19. The City will not open applications for small business grants; instead, it will identify eligible grantees from the current pool of Small Business Stabilization Fund (SBSF) applicants. The most recent round of SBSF grants closed on November 30, and an initial analysis by the City\u2019s Office of Economic Development shows that approximately 1,100 restaurant or bar owners applied for grants. All eligible applicants will receive grants to support continuing operations including outdoor dining, takeout, and delivery. Restaurants and bars who receive grants through this newest round will remain eligible for up to $10,000 SBSF grant as well.\n\n\u201cRestaurants and bars are central to Seattle\u2019s soul. The COVID-19 pandemic is crippling our small business community, and local restaurants and bars are doing their part to stem the spread of the virus as we all endure this unprecedented challenge,\u201d said Jessica Tousignant, Executive Director of Seattle Restaurants United. \u201cI am glad to see the City stepping up and providing immediate relief to restaurants and bars and their workers, and I urge Congress to also meet the urgency of this moment and provide immediate financial relief for small businesses and workers.\u201d\n\nAn additional $2.5 million in grants will go to cash assistance to hospitality industry workers who have been financially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. To be eligible for a grant, workers would need to demonstrate that they have been financially impacted by the pandemic, whether that\u2019s through a layoff or reduction in hours. Cash assistance will be determined commensurate to need, up to $1,000, with higher amounts going to those who are housing insecure. The City\u2019s Human Services Department will contract with a third-party agency to conduct the application process and distribute the grants. More information on the agency will be available in the coming days.\n\nTo date, the City has invested $8.6 million in small businesses through its emergency Small Business Stabilization Fund.

Brooks recently took a lead role in funding the establishment of the Running Industry Diversity Coalition (RIDC), officially launched in October.\n\nThe RIDC, a group of brands, retailers, and individual runners, coalesced over the summer to help increase the running industry\u2019s equity and inclusion with regard to race, religion, gender, sexuality, ability, immigration status, and socioeconomic status. With grants from Brooks and shoe and apparel brand Hoka One One, the RIDC aims to make industry gains in diverse representation, employment, ownership, and access, as well as education on anti-Blackness and historical injustice.\n\nThe coalition was born as runners across the country grappled with racial injustice following the death of Ahmaud Arbery. Arbery was running near his home in Satilla Shores, Georgia, when he was fatally shot after being pursued by two white men. His death forced many industry leaders to reckon with the reality of racial injustice. They all faced the same question: How do you translate all this awareness into systemic change?\n\nShannon Woods, senior manager for Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) at Brooks, has ideas for how to answer that query. Woods is a native Seattleite; she loves the Southern restaurant Junebaby and running in Seward Park, though her favorite trail circles Mountain Lake on Orcas Island. She now sits on the leadership team at the RIDC, and while the coalition remains in its early stages, she spoke to Seattle Met about its initial efforts. The following conversation, held over Zoom, has been edited for clarity.\n\nHow did the leadership team at the Running Industry Diversity Coalition (RIDC) come to found the organization?\n\nIt was really sparked by the [co-]owner of Gazelle Sports in Michigan, Chris Lampen-Crowell. He was very personally affected by the death of Ahmaud Arbery. At that time, he started having conversations with his industry friends\u2014just reflective conversations [of] like, \u201cWhat can we do as an industry?\u201d After the death of George Floyd is when he took that next step from having conversation [to] putting it into action. So he reached out to Alison D\u00e9sir, and there was a chain reaction of people being reached out to and [they] came up with wanting to start this coalition to really address racism within the running industry and really wanting to make change. As a white man, he felt a responsibility to help create that change.\n\nIn that collaboration, they reached out to Jim Weber, the CEO of Brooks Running, and Jim sat in on the first couple of meetings of that coalition, then graciously handed the seat to me.\n\nHow did he decide to reach out to Jim [of Brooks Running] specifically?\n\nAs much as I can speak to that via Chris, Brooks has a really strong reputation for years of customer service. We\u2019re primarily a wholesaler; we only have two stores. We have our trailhead in Fremont, Seattle, and we have an outlet store in Bothell. So we're mostly a wholesaler and we sell to specialty retail stores. We've always put people first and runners first, so we\u2019ve had these really, really strong relationships. And Brooks was a smaller company for a while. We've gotten fairly bigger; over the last 10 years or so, we've grown quite a bit. But really, relationships have always been at the heart of our business. So Jim and some members of our leadership team and our sales team are very close with a lot of the specialty run[ning] retail owners.\n\nAnd this conversation was taking place over the summer?\n\nYeah, I jumped in on the coalition in the beginning of August. There were a couple meetings that happened in July, so June/July is really when the coalition formed.\n\nShannon Woods, senior manager of DEI at Brooks Running. Image: Courtesy Brooks Running\n\nThe goals of the coalition right now are targeting so many different areas. Which ones stand out to you [and others across the industry]?\n\n\n\nI think that one thing that is very unique about this coalition is that it brings together brands and retailers and individual runners. The coalition itself is very diverse. And it may be the most diverse team in the running industry right now, with majority women and majority BIPOC on the team. It\u2019s unique in the way that we\u2019ve got two brands [Brooks Running and Hoka One One] coming together. Typically, we are so competitive. Typically, we [don\u2019t] share information or come together on something. The idea that we\u2019ve got brands coming together to work collectively towards a goal for the greater good I think is unique in this space.\n\nWhen we look at the running community, the running community itself\u2026could be more diverse, but it is somewhat diverse to begin with. Where we see the biggest disparity is when we look at the running industry and those businesses that are making money off of runners. That is where you see that it\u2019s mostly white.\n\nThere\u2019s still a lot of research that needs to be done looking at those numbers and those metrics. One study that we found looked at the top 15 running brands and their leadership was less than 1 percent. Like, 0.5 percent of leaders are BIPOC. So that is where we see the biggest disparity.\n\nSo we have a leader like Chris [Lampen-Crowell], who is affected by the events of this year and was thinking about what he could do and wrestling with the industry\u2019s complicity. Beyond the coalition, I wonder what that conversation looks like. Outside of Chris and outside of the coalition founders, were there other opportunities to examine those disparities in leadership, and did we see that across the industry?\n\nI think that you see it across the industry. The events of Ahmaud Arbery being murdered\u2014I know for the leaders at Brooks, it really was shocking to them. And then as the months went on, Breonna Taylor was murdered, then we all witnessed George Floyd being murdered. I think it was shocking to some people. All of a sudden, there\u2019s all this attention coming to light even though it was not a new issue. I think for runners, Ahmaud was like, wow, he\u2019s just like me. There was a bit of being able to relate to him that really affected people.\n\nThe conversations in the industry have been challenging, but I think those events allowed those conversations to happen in a different way than they\u2019ve happened before. There have been people working on diversity, equity, and inclusion for a very long time. There\u2019s been people who have been working individually in different companies on diversity, equity, and inclusion for a long time. But I think it just allowed more people to [come] into that conversation.\n\nWere there flash points or memories from that period of time that changed the way you personally were experiencing all of the news?\n\nYeah, it was such an emotional time. I mean, it still is. It was a little bit different for me. When I think about the question of flash points, it\u2019s hard for me to think about what\u2026that moment [was]. I\u2019m mixed. I\u2019m African American and white. So none of this is new to me. When I think of a flashpoint I think maybe for me, it was Trayvon Martin and he was murdered. I have three boys and one of them is the same age as Tamir Rice. So that was so heartbreaking. For me to, at that time, look at my own son, who was 12 years old, who\u2019s brown, it\u2019s just devastating. I also have another son who\u2019s the same age as Ahmaud Arbery. My heart breaks for his mother, being able to relate as a mom.\n\nWe\u2019ve been saying all these things, and we\u2019ve been working towards that. Why are you all of the sudden listening? For me, it was hard to understand.\n\nYou know, I\u2019ve been working on DEI for many years and I\u2019ve been working with Brooks on DEI for many years. Over the summer, after George Floyd, one of those flash points for me was trying to understand why everyone is paying attention now. I\u2019ve been out there protesting for Black lives for many years. I\u2019ve been telling leadership and companies; I\u2019ve also worked in DEI in education in Seattle. I\u2019ve been saying\u2014or I shouldn\u2019t say I\u2014but the group of people that I work with, we've been saying our company needs to be more diverse, we need to hire more people, we need more people in leadership. We\u2019ve been saying all these things, and we\u2019ve been working towards that. Why are you all of the sudden listening? For me, it was hard to understand, because this was the first time it\u2019s happened. It\u2019s not the first time it was caught on video. So trying to unpack like, why is everyone here now? You haven\u2019t cared this much over decades. That was my struggle.\n\nIn my frustration, I have to credit my mother for helping me move along from that. She said to me, \u201cWell, now you have their attention. What are you going to do with it?\u201d I was like, \u201cOkay, yeah. I hear you. Let\u2019s figure out how to move forward.\"\n\nWhen you sit with that question, how is that shaping your thinking now, both at Brooks and in the broader coalition? What is your vision as senior manager of DEI at Brooks, and what are you looking to focus on in the coming year?\n\nI think my vision for Brooks, as the senior manager of DEI, is that Brooks can be a leader in diversity, equity, and inclusion. In our workplace, with runners, and in our community.\n\nHow do those two look different? What would be the specifics within the workplace? Do you have quantifiable goals or are their [qualitative] learning objectives that you want to communicate?\n\nWe are looking at some bold goals around hiring, around education within our company, and expanding on what the workplace looks like. Does the workplace just mean within our four walls? Or does it also mean who we\u2019re doing business with, who we\u2019re partnering with outside of our walls?\n\nDiversity, equity, and inclusion are three very different things. So [first] realizing that if we can hire people to the extent that we want to create a really innovative, creative company. But how do we keep people at our company? [Then] looking at our equitable policies and practices, and then also inclusion. Inclusion is hard because that is how people feel. It\u2019s a hard one to tackle. You could hire, hire, hire, but if you don\u2019t have a great, inclusive culture, people aren\u2019t going to stick around.\n\nRight. Do you see that as the major challenge? I\u2019m understanding [that] it\u2019s such a massive issue and even tackling it, doing the work itself is the major challenge. But in terms of roadblocks, things that are difficult, would you say that inclusion is the major one? Are there other challenges you anticipate ahead?\n\nWell, I have this philosophy about everything: We\u2019re a company of very smart, creative people, so a lot of times I feel like our biggest obstacle is ourselves. We just have to say \"yes\" and prioritize it and then we can figure out how to do it.\n\nI think [for] a lot of companies, their first initial reaction is to start with representation. That\u2019s how we\u2019re going to be diverse is putting BIPOC people in our ads, on our social media, and representation is so important. It\u2019s really important for runners to be able to see themselves in the sport and [for] young people to have role models in the sport. One of the challenges is recognizing that we are more than runners and models. We are also photographers and cinematographers and stylists and engineers and leaders. Representation is important, but if you don\u2019t hire people to run your business, then you\u2019re not actually creating systemic change.\n\nThat\u2019s the piece of just opening up and influencing people to expand their own networks. I think that where we see hiring challenges, it\u2019s not that there aren\u2019t BIPOC people out there [who are] skilled in different areas. But traditionally, how corporations and businesses hire is through who you know, and if your own network is very homogenous, it just perpetuates into your business. So getting people to stretch themselves and reach out to broader networks of people and meet new people, there\u2019s a bit of that that has to be done on a business level. Your business can do strategic outreach, but then every individual person within that business also has to broaden their own network.\n\nThat makes sense, and also really gets to what you said about inclusion. I\u2019m wondering what the concrete goals are for creating that inclusive environment. It seems like with more and more hiring, you can reach a tipping point to where there is enough community there [for people to] really feel at home. Are there other concrete goals you would look to in the inclusivity [of] a company\u2019s culture? Would that look like creating spaces for conversations or BIPOC-specific spaces?\n\nFor sure. We do have an employee resource group right now that\u2019s called the Diversity Working Group. That\u2019s a group of employees that tackle DEI topics within Brooks. We are also looking to formalize and support affinity groups within our organization. We do have forums and speaker forums: We currently have a Women at Brooks speaker forum and a DEI conversation forum. So that is internally and for employees.\n\nThat women\u2019s speaker series has been going on for four years. That brings sometimes internal, but also external people into Brooks to speak about their experiences. We\u2019ve made a lot of progress with women in leadership over the years. We have a mentorship program within our organization.\n\nI think that Seattle has a progressive label that sometimes people hide behind. I think that Seattle definitely needs to recognize the racism that happens within our city. There\u2019s probably a lot of really good conversation that could happen.\n\nIn 2017, we joined the Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index. That is an index that rates companies from zero to 100 on policies and practices around LGBTQ equality. We are now rated one of the best companies to work for for LGBTQ equality. We flew a pride flag, the progress pride flag, on our building this year; we participated in Seattle Pride. All of those things help for inclusion for sure.\n\nWe also supported our employees to have flexible work schedules to celebrate Juneteenth and also participate in the Black Lives Matter protests\u2026 When Black Lives Matter King County had a day of strike, Brooks Leadership came out and said, \u201cAnybody who wants to participate in this, we fully support you.\u201d\n\nShifting the conversation to the Seattle-specific events of this year, is the conversation in Seattle different than the national conversation in any way?\n\nYeah, that\u2019s a really good question. The RIDC hasn\u2019t tackled by region, but that\u2019s a really interesting question to think about. We are embarking on a research project around diversity in the running industry which I think could include some differences by region. It\u2019s a little hard for me to say. The conversations I have within the RIDC and with the RIDC network of people\u2014so it\u2019s people from all over the country\u2014I definitely find that there are similarities in the conversations. People want to know, what can I do? What can I do now? How are we going to change this?\n\nI grew up in Seattle, so I\u2019m a native of Seattle. I\u2019ve traveled a lot, but I think that Seattle has a progressive label that sometimes people hide behind. I think that Seattle definitely needs to recognize the racism that happens within our city. There\u2019s probably a lot of really good conversation that could happen with that; I think that we are progressive in the sense of our public governance, but when it comes to private businesses and corporations and the day-to-day experiences of BIPOC within our city\u2026 We have a history. We have racist history, we have a history of redlining, which you can certainly see in the segregation of neighborhoods within the city. I think there\u2019s a lot of conversation to be had around that in the city of Seattle\u2026 I often hear from people, after Ahmaud Arbery, \u201cOh that stuff only happens in the South, that wouldn\u2019t happen here.\u201d And it\u2019s interesting to me, because we all walk through our own worlds, right? We experience things, but I do think there\u2019s a lot of people that don\u2019t know the things that BIPOC people experience on a day-to-day basis, even here in Seattle.", "title": "How Can Seattle Lead the Way to a More Inclusive Running Industry?", "dataset": "['manual_google_by_location']", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Seattle']"}, {"id": 8813, "city": null, "url": "https://www.capitolhillseattle.com/2020/12/amid-seattles-big-issues-around-policing-community-meeting-digs-through-the-nitty-gritty-of-2020-crime-in-the-east-precinct/", "text": "Beneath the \u201cdefund\u201d push to redirect Seattle Police spending to social and community programs and the political maneuverings around removing the wall outside the East Precinct and reopening Cal Anderson Park, the nitty gritty of neighborhood crime concerns was at the forefront Thursday night for the monthly meeting of the East Precinct Advisory Council.\n\nProperty crime is on the rise in the East Precinct, SPD leadership told community members Thursday evening, with car theft, arson, and burglary up compared to 2019.\n\nSPD crime prevention coordinator Joe Elenbaas joined the East Precinct Advisory Council to outline ways to prevent mail and car theft. Recommendations included signing up for the United States Postal Service\u2019s Informed Delivery program, which lets recipients know what mail they\u2019ll be receiving so they can pick it up quickly, anti-theft devices in cars, and hiding electronics that might indicate there are expensive items in the vehicle.\n\nElenbaas said that they are hearing of increased package theft from East Precinct residents but that victims are apparently not bothering to report the crimes.\n\nThe community meeting highlighted several areas of concern from SPD including arson, vehicle thefts, and property crime at Seattle University and businesses.\n\nThere were 15 arson offenses in the East Precinct area, which includes the area stretching from Montlake to I-90 on the east side of I-5, last year. In the first 11 months of this year, SPD has counted 34 cases of arsons. One person died this week in a fire in a vacant building on 21st and Denny.\n\nThere were also 466 motor vehicle thefts last year; 564 so far this year. Burglary is up to 1,528 cases from 1,168 in 2019.\n\nThe only type of property crime that has decreased this year is personal property theft, or larceny, down to 2,585 reports from nearly 3,400 last year.\n\nCHS\u2019s report on summer crime trends showed overall crime down as the pandemic had radically shifted people\u2019s behaviors and activities but the core, most serious crimes up 12% in a surge that began in January well before the pandemic and protests set in.\n\nFocusing on the most serious crimes that SPD uses for its statistical analysis like assaults, burglaries, and vehicle related crimes, CHS showed crime was down 4% through August in 2020. In June during the height of CHOP, crime \u2014 including everything from animal cruelty to street robberies \u2014 dropped 14% from recent years across the precinct.\n\nBur burglaries were still surging, especially in the Pike/Pine area.\n\nSince the summer, SPD says property crimes have only gotten worse.\n\nCapitol Hill\u2019s Seattle University has seen increased property crime, the school\u2019s assistant director of operations Nikki Maryanski said Thursday night. Maryanski noted, for example, more feces in garage stairwells and a broken window at the law school in late November on the same night demonstrators targeted a nearby Starbucks.\n\nThe Safeway grocery store on 15th and John has also seen several spates of crime, with, for instance, shoplifting turning into more serious robbery, police said.\n\nVictoria Beach, chair of the African American Community Advisory Council, said that her neighborhood has seen \u201cnonstop\u201d car damage for years.\n\nBut there are bigger worries.\n\nHomicides have seen a big jump in 2020 according to East Precinct Capt. Eric Sano. SPD reports nine murders here so far in 2020. There were five East Precinct homicides in all of 2019 and three the year before. That trend has carried across the city where SPD says there have been 41 homicides in 2020 \u2014 up from 28 last year.\n\nGun related crimes have also climbed.\n\n\u201cVery, very troubling for all of us,\u201d he said.\n\nSano also noted that interim police chief Adrian Diaz has recently been going over a report on bias and hate crimes in Seattle that will be released soon. Experts from the King County Prosecutor\u2019s Office said this week that hate crime reports are up this year in the county during the coronavirus pandemic, from 30 in 2018 and 38 in 2019 to 51 so far this year.\n\nSano expressed hopes that the East Precinct building and nearby Cal Anderson Park could be officially reopened soon, but it remains difficult to remove homeless encampments in the Capitol Hill park during the coronavirus pandemic. Mayor Jenny Durkan has said efforts at Cal Anderson would focus outreach, not sweeps but it remains to be seen how the city\u2019s new homelessness resources will be brought to bear at the park.\n\n\u201cWe are trying to get back to a semblance of normalcy,\u201d Sano said. \u201cWe can go in and continue to clean up these parks, but unless we give these people an alternative, a viable alternative to go to, they\u2019re just going to come back into the park.\u201d\n\n$5/MONTH?

Including the parkets,\" said Cardamone.Many parents and children in San Franciscan were also struggling with the thought of a second stay-at-home order which mean: no playgrounds.\"First of all, school very frustrated and now I hear I can't even come and bring my kid to the park. Very frustrated,\" said parent, David Penney.\"It's devastating because I think they still remember how it was before things opened up,\" said parent Sarah Kliban.It's even harder to break the news to the little one.\"I think is very sad,\" responded 6-year-old Erly Penney.\"Well I think it's a bummer but at least I'll have my skateboard,\" said 8 year old, Antonella Germano.\"Very, very frustrating.

It\u2019s a costly, ambitious plan that could potentially make a dent in the city\u2019s unrelenting homeless crisis, if it succeeds.\n\nBut if the department falls short, hundreds of people with medical issues, mental illnesses and drug addiction could wind up back on the streets, and unravel the progress they might have made while living indoors the past few months.\n\n\u201cThis is a very difficult balancing act that we\u2019re trying to attempt,\u201d said Abigail Stewart-Kahn, interim director of the Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing. She said the department needs to take care of people in the hotels, while also expanding resources for the many still on the streets.\n\nOn Friday, the department released its most detailed proposal yet on how it will gradually wind down the hotel program and move people into longer-term housing. According to the proposal, all of the city\u2019s 25 hotels will close by November. That\u2019s a longer timeline than the department\u2019s initial plan to close the hotels by June.\n\nThe report also details the city\u2019s housing inventory and rent vouchers \u2014 and what it still needs to meet the demand.\n\nThe city has leased 25 hotels for the homeless during the pandemic, spending between $15 million and $18 million a month on the program. The city expects the majority of the costs to be reimbursed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, but it\u2019s unclear when the FEMA funding will run out.\n\nThe department said it needed to begin winding down the program because it is not financially sustainable without the FEMA funding. The city controller has warned that the reimbursement could run out with short notice.\n\nService providers and supervisors have sharply criticized the department over the past few months for what they said was a hasty wind-down that would leave many people without stable housing. Following the backlash \u2014 as well as an extra $10 million in state assistance \u2014 the department took a step back and revised their proposal.\n\nAccording to the proposal, the first 476 people will be gradually moved out of seven hotels by the end of March. Some residents will be placed into housing beginning in January. The department will consolidate those still waiting for a housing placement into other hotels.\n\nBut a look at San Francisco\u2019s available housing options shows the challenges ahead.\n\nThere are about 520 permanent supportive housing units set aside for the first phase of closures \u2014 but not all are available, or even funded. That funding depends on the Board of Supervisors approving a spending plan that taps the city\u2019s Proposition C funds, a business tax that was passed in 2018.\n\nStewart-Kahn said it\u2019s essential that the department can use the Prop. C money to pay for more permanent supportive housing and rental vouchers. Without that money, she said, the department will struggle to offer all hotel residents long-term housing.\n\nThe Our City Our Home committee \u2014 which oversees the Prop. C funds \u2014 will make recommendations to the board on how to spend the money. The Board of Supervisors will then vote on the spending plan this month.\n\nJennifer Friedenbach, director of the Coalition on Homelessness and a member of the Prop. C advisory committee, said there is \u201ca lot of positive stuff\u201d in the report, and she is pleased the department listened to the community and extended the timeline for the closures.\n\nBut, she said, she is worried the plan is over-reliant on Prop. C funds.\n\nIf the department uses the Prop. C fund as outlined in the report, she said it would not leave enough money to address the hundreds \u2014 maybe thousands \u2014 of people who are still living on the streets.\n\nShe said she would rather the city use Prop. C funds to be able to get \u201canother couple hundred people off the streets\u201d by, for example, buying more hotels. The city has bought two hotels so far, which it plans to turn into permanent supportive housing.\n\nSara Shortt, director of policy and organizing at the Community Housing Partnership, said the new plan was a \u201cvast improvement\u201d from the previous one and she is glad the city will have more time to figure out where to place people.\n\n\u201cHowever, the information about housing options for residents still leaves a lot of uncertainty,\u201d she said.\n\nAs San Francisco slows down the closures, officials in Alameda County are facing criticism for their plan to close most hotels for the homeless by February.\n\nSeveral supervisors in San Francisco also proposed legislation this week that would halt the wind-down process, unless FEMA provides written notification that it would stop providing funding to the city.\n\nSupervisor Hillary Ronen, a co-sponsor of the legislation, said she is glad \u201cthe mayor and her staff finally realize that it makes no sense to close the (shelter-in-place) hotels in the middle of the worst COVID surge during the dead of winter.\u201d\n\nBut Ronen said she still wanted more details to ensure that \u201cno one currently living in the hotels is returned to the street and that there continues to be places for people to go that are living on the streets today.\u201d\n\nTrisha Thadani is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

The teams will then connect them to services supported by the city\u2019s Department of Public Health and ensure follow-up care, Breed\u2019s office said.\n\nThe team includes behavioral health peer specialists, who are people who have surpassed homelessness, substance use and, or mental health issues and become skilled to help others experiencing such situations, according to Breed\u2019s office.\n\n\u201cThis new program can help us break the cycle that all too often keeps people going in and out of our emergency rooms and our jails. When the Street Crisis Response Team responds to a call for someone in crisis, they\u2019ll be able to help with compassion and clinical skills to get people the care and support they need,\u201d Breed said. \u201cChanging the way we respond to non-violent calls is going to take works and it\u2019s going to take time. The SCRT is an important first step in our long-term effort change how we respond to people suffering on our streets.\u201d\n\nUnder the program\u2019s first phase, the teams will operate in the Tenderloin Monday through Friday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. The city then plans to add more teams in the coming months, with six teams by March 2021. The city hopes to then expand the teams to operate citywide, seven days a week.\n\nThe program was created through a partnership between the DPH and the city\u2019s Fire Department and is part of Mental Health SF, an ongoing effort to revamp the city\u2019s responses to mental health and substance use problems.\n\n\u00a9 Copyright 2020 CBS Broadcasting Inc. and Bay City News Service.

There's a chance the county may not be able to keep up with the surge in cases.\n\nSan Francisco had been reaching about 80% of those who'd tested COVID positive. But, with the surge in cases, even with additional staff and new technology, they simply may not be able to keep up.\n\nPublic health experts say contact tracing, contacting people tested COVID positive and tracking down the people they'd come into contact with, is a critical part of battling the pandemic.\n\n\"It is an effective way, if we're doing it well and everyone is engaging in it, the public works with us on it, it allows us to stop the ongoing cycles of transmission,\" said Dr. Susan Philip from San Francisco's Department of Public Health.\n\nUntil recently San Francisco had been talking to about 80% of COVID patients to track down and notify their contacts that they may have been exposed. Those contact tracers are now handling three and a half times the number of cases than a month ago.\n\nIn the last week San Francisco's Department of Public Health added an additional 100 contact tracers to the 200 the county already had in place, and has adopted the state's mobile contact tracing platform.

They point to that new mobile platform, they say 40% of those they reach out to respond to the messages about isolating themselves and share data on who've they've come in contact with within 20 minutes of the first text message.\n\nThose who work with contact tracers playing a critical role in combating coronavirus.\n\n\"One thing the public can do is limiting the number of close contacts that you have,\" said Dr. Philip. \"Now is not the time to go into a large party and have 100 close contacts.\"\n\nThe increase in cases which those contact tracers are tracking down still doesn't including the expected surge of new COVID cases health experts are expecting will follow Thanksgiving holiday when many people traveled to visit family and friends.", "title": "San Francisco\u2019s ability to contact trace could soon reach breaking point", "dataset": "['manual_google_by_location']", "labels": "['health']", "annot_city": "['San Francisco']"}, {"id": 8819, "city": null, "url": "https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2020/12/05/protest-in-support-of-indian-farmers-slows-traffic-on-bay-bridge/", "text": "SAN FRANCISCO (CBS SF) \u2014 A caravan of protesters trying to raise the awareness of a showdown in India between farmers and the government clogged up traffic on the busy San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge Saturday afternoon.\n\nPosts on social media show the protesters, traveling in a car caravan from around the region, demanding support for Indian farmers who are on strike.\n\n\u201cWe stand with farmers\u201d signs displayed on cars during a car caravan on the bay bridge.

Here\u2019s a Guide.\n\nThe perfect pandemic activity is becoming a tree guru\n\nPhoto: Lingxiao Xie\n\nIn the three blocks between my home and the nearest coffee shop, there are over 20 species of trees from six continents. There\u2019s the adorably short fig tree in my neighbor\u2019s yard, a silver tree that glistens under the sun, and a cork oak with a squishy trunk. There\u2019s also a grapefruit tree, a row of Marina strawberry trees, a Japanese blueberry tree, and an Indian hawthorn. All live and thrive on a single street in San Francisco.\n\n\u201cSan Franciscans enjoy unusual stuff,\u201d says Mike Sullivan, author of The Trees of San Francisco and one of three organizers of the Covid-19 tree tours that first sparked my love for my street\u2019s trees. \u201cPeople choose to be unusual here. We love diversity in human beings and diversity in our trees.\u201d\n\nUnlike most major cities, San Francisco allows residents to plant their own street trees, resulting in an urban forest as diverse as the people who live here. Though the city\u2019s Mediterranean climate can be hard on trees, nearly 125,000 of them live here with more than 500 species from all over the world.\n\nSince stumbling upon a self-guided Covid-19 tree tour organized by Sullivan and fellow tree nerds Jason Dewees and Richard Turner, getting to know my street trees has become a favorite pandemic activity. At first, I followed chalk markings left by the trio on sidewalks, detailing the common and Latin names of those they found noteworthy. Then I ventured out on my own, using Sullivan\u2019s book and the app LeafSnap to identify trees in my neighborhood.\n\nI felt as if I had acquired a new pair of eyes. Street corners and front yards I\u2019ve walked past hundreds of times suddenly had new meaning. Instead of feeling trapped in my neighborhood because of the pandemic, I saw how expansive it was. Not only did I get the best workout in months from the hills of San Francisco, getting to know my street trees has given me a sense of purpose. Instead of wandering around my neighborhood and letting my worries consume me, I learned to stop and observe. Tall and unwavering, the trees are a reminder to pause and appreciate what\u2019s right in front of me.\n\nIn addition to their beauty, urban trees are also highly functional. They provide habitats for birds, bees, and butterflies, reduce the heat-island effect in the city, help filter stormwater, and improve air quality by storing carbon dioxide. In other words, we couldn\u2019t live without them.\n\nIf you think of trees as nothing more than green blurs on the side of the road, here are a few common ones in San Francisco to learn so you can get started on a new-found appreciation:\n\nLondon plane tree\n\nFrequently seen in San Francisco, London plane trees can also be found at the Civic Center, welcoming visitors to City Hall.\n\nNew Zealand Christmas tree\n\nNative to New Zealand, these trees with crimson flowers thrive in San Francisco.\n\nWater gum/small-leaf tristania\n\nThese hardy and resilient trees are native to eastern Australia.\n\nPurple-leaf plum\n\nOnce the most commonly planted trees in San Francisco, the purple-leaf plum has an early bloom and early leaf drop.\n\nUrban tree watching, in addition to the personal and societal benefits it provides, feels surprisingly intimate. I now know that a neighbor is hoping to harvest figs, that another has a garden full of native Californian plants, and yet another has possibly the only bloodwood tree outside of the San Francisco Botanical Garden. Getting to know the trees feels very much like getting to know my neighbors themselves. The plants in their yards offer a glimpse of their likes, dislikes, and the amount of care they dedicate to living beings. In a time when we have to stay apart to keep each other safe, getting to know our neighborhood trees is the perfect reminder that we are all part of something much bigger.", "title": "Do You Know Your Neighborhood Trees in SF?

That means standing up and doing something, and every little bit helps.\"\n\nShabazz is among the countless Detroit community activists who work, often without fanfare, to improve the quality of life for residents. In the nation's most violent city, that usually means addressing crime, either directly or indirectly.\n\n\"There are many different ways of dealing with these issues, such as providing alternatives to crime, and things like utility assistance, help with jobs and schools \u2014 but it all starts with love,\" Shabazz said. \"We can't solve these problems in the inner city without love. Jesus Christ teaches us that.\"\n\nThrough the years, Shabazz has organized citizen patrols, passed out flyers about unsolved crimes and missing persons, and led protests of drug houses. He, along with motivational speaker and ex-felon Raphael B. Johnson and the late Angelo Henderson, a former Detroit News reporter and radio host, founded the Detroit 300 patrol group in 2010, after a series of home invasions and sexual assaults of senior citizens.\n\n\"A lot of people are running their mouths and not doing anything, but Malik has been out there, and he's effective,\" Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan said. \"At personal risk, he and his group have stood outside drug houses and banged pots and pans, trying to drive them out of business.\n\n\"He's been critical of the Police Department sometimes, but he's also worked with the police when they've been sincere about trying to catch murderers and the like, and I think with the current administration, there's no doubt he's been a great partner,\" Duggan said. \"He can get out there in the community and say and do things the police can't do.\"\n\nMovements like Shabazz's can help make Detroit safer \u2014 even if their efforts aren't always directly related to curbing crime, said Luther Keith, a former Detroit News editor and director of Arise! Detroit \u2014 a nonprofit that helps secure funding and provides other services to the city's community groups.\n\n\"Any program that helps young people is an anti-crime program,\" Keith said. \"They're not thought of that way, but that's exactly what they are, because these programs are giving young people alternatives. Same thing with any program that does things like organize neighborhood cleanups \u2014 it's all related.\"\n\nHow police view efforts\n\nMany police officials agree with the philosophy. In law enforcement, it's called the \"broken windows\" theory, which holds that ignoring visible signs of crime and antisocial behavior creates an environment that allows those problems to fester.\n\nDetroit Police Chief James Craig said he appreciates Shabazz's efforts.\n\n\"There's no question, he and others like him have been a great help toward what we're trying to do, which is keep this city safe,\" Craig said.\n\nThe chief credits the efforts of Shabazz and others with helping the city avoid looting and property damage during a summer of protests over the death of George Floyd from a Minneapolis police chokehold.\n\n\"We've established strong relationships with groups like his, which is why, while other cities burned, Detroit didn't burn.\"\n\nKeith said efforts to improve Detroit are often carried out in obscurity.\n\n\"A lot of times, these groups are out there working, and they get no recognition,\" he said. \"These organizations don't have PR firms, so they don't get much publicity, but they are as crucial to Detroit as anybody.\"\n\nRashaan Mix agreed. The 46-year-old Detroit resident was one of about a dozen people who joined Shabazz recently in Dequindre-Grixdale Park on the city's east side to search for possible witnesses to a hit-and-run homicide.\n\n\"I don't care about fanfare; I love my city, and I love my people,\" Mix said. \"You see rapes and murders, and all these other crimes that go unsolved, and I want to help find the people who did it, so the families can have some peace.\"\n\nShabazz, Mix and the rest of the small group gathered under a park gazebo to pray and eat hot dogs before passing out Crime Stoppers of Michigan flyers that offer a $2,700 reward for information leading to the arrest of the driver who ran down 27-year-old Steven Radcliff about 1:32 a.m. on March 17.\n\nRadcliff had just picked up a pack of Newport 100 cigarettes and was walking home southbound on Dequindre just outside Dequindre-Grixdale Park when a white 2011 or 2012 Ford Escape struck him. The driver sped away, police said.\n\n\"I just want to find out who did it,\" said Radcliff's mother, Beverly Winfrey. \"I've been passing out flyers, and I paid for two billboards (enlargements of the Crime Stoppers flyers). It's so wonderful to have other people come out to help. It means a lot.\"\n\nWinfrey's longtime friend Dorina Andrews said the support is helping.\n\n\"When you're going through what she's going through, any little bit can help sometimes,\" Andrews said. \"I know it's not the biggest story in the world, a hit-and-run, but the person who did it needs to be held accountable. Stand up and admit what you did. Ease this woman's pain over losing her son.\"\n\n'We're responsible' for 'our city'\n\nAt one point as Shabazz addressed the group, a breeze blew a candy wrapper near his foot. He reached down and picked it up, along with other pieces of trash, which he threw into a nearby garbage can.\n\n\"The can is empty, and the garbage is on the ground,\" he said. \"How would you feel if someone dumped trash in your yard? This is our city. We're responsible for it.\n\n\"My great-grandmother lived in a house in Virginia with a dirt floor, and she'd sweep the dirt,\" Shabazz said. \"We'd ask, 'Why are you doing that?' and she'd say, 'I'm keeping my dirt clean.' You have to be responsible for what's yours.\"\n\nShabazz said he'd like to see more people come out to events like the one at Dequindre-Grixdale Park.\n\n\"Sure, sometimes it gets discouraging,\" he said. \"I think all people get discouraged sometimes. But I get a lot of love, too. Elderly people come up and hold our hands, and give us cookies.\n\n\"I do this because I love Detroit, and because I'm a Christian,\" he said. \"Love motivates me.

Action News spoke with Ralph Godbee who is the Chief of Staff to Pastor Kinloch Jr.\n\n\"In the black community there's a lot of skepticism,\" Godbee said. \"And, it's somewhat of a catch 22 because if they're [blacks] not offered the vaccine first then there's an insensitivity towards the disproportionate effect on the black community.\"\n\nRELATED: https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/06/04/black-americans-face-higher-covid-19-risks-are-more-hesitant-to-trust-medical-scientists-get-vaccinated/\n\nDetroit's Mayor Mike Duggan aims to vaccinate 5,000 people a day once the vaccine becomes readily available. Duggan called it an enormous challenge.\n\nMeantime, studies show black people face higher COVID-19 risk but are more hesitant to trust the vaccine. Godbee believes decades of mistrust and abuse is the cause.\n\n\"That goes back the Tuskegee experiment and a number of things that has disenfranchised black and brown people in the US,\" Godbee said. \"This is where credibility matters in this conversation.\"\n\nOn Friday, during President-Elect Joe Biden's remarks from his campaign headquarters in Wilmington, Delaware, he spoke briefly on how his administration would coordinate the rollout of the vaccine.\n\n\"Blacks and Latinos are 3 times as likely to die if they get COVID-19. So, the communities of color it's a mass causality event,\" Mr. Biden said. \"And so, we have to figure out how we make sure we get the vaccines to those communities... delivering a large number of vaccines to the Wal-Mart's and other major drug chains does not get you into a lot of these neighborhoods and it does not guarantee it gets around.\"\n\nMeanwhile, leaders at Triumph Church are providing the congregation with resources to make an informed decision on whether or not to get the vaccination.\n\nAdditional Coronavirus information and resources:\n\nClick here for a page with resources including a COVID-19 overview from the CDC, details on cases in Michigan, a timeline of Governor Gretchen Whitmer's orders since the outbreak, coronavirus' impact on Southeast Michigan, and links to more information from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services, the CDC and the WHO.\n\nView a global coronavirus tracker with data from Johns Hopkins University.\n\nSee complete coverage on our Coronavirus Continuing Coverage page.\n\nVisit our The Rebound Detroit, a place where we are working to help people impacted financially from the coronavirus.

Saxophonist De'Sean Jones and guitarist Sasha Kashperko were on a midwest tour with Jones's group Knomadik, and during one of their friendly \"arguments\" the question came up of how musicians incorporate protest into their art. If one is not on the front lines at the marches, then the best way to showcase \"your resistance is to let it come out in your music and let the music and art do the talking for you,\" says Jones.Little did they know that their conversation would spark an 11-volume set of recordings that would specifically deal with the pandemic, as well as the political and social unrest of 2020. The first volume, titled, which dropped on Nov. 6, is a combination of genres from jazz to hip-hop and rock, complete with heavy drum and bass elements all meant to illustrate the turbulent state of the world.Jones leads the fusion ensemble De\u2019Sean Jones & Knomadik, and he has a stress-tested reputation in Detroit with his artful blending of jazz, heavy metal, hip-hop, and techno music. He's worked with big-league acts such as Karen Clark Sheard and Kierra \"KiKi\" Sheard, Christian McBride, and Rick Ross.Kashperko's resume is fat too. He\u2019s built an international reputation, having run the streets with the likes of Common, Robert Glasper, Karriem Riggins, Black Milk, and Robert Hurst. Jones and Kashperko clicked musically around 2015 and Kashperko joined Knomadik in 2018.Jones feels their collaboration has been the perfect marriage. He\u2019s drawn to Kashperko\u2019s composing and is in awe of his production acumen. Over the years, Kashperko has quietly regarded Jones as sort of a musical big bro. \"I'm very fortunate to be a part of the group, they have been heroes of mine for a while,\" Kashperko says.Anti-Philosophy is both the name of the album series and the group which Jones and Kashperko started this year. Their name is a play on the Associated Press, as they see their music as a news outlet for current events.\"It's definitely a sonic representation of these events and this past year. Our song titles are sort of like conversation starters\u201d says Kashperko. \"I would say we're trying to be somewhat unbiased, but definitely pointing to these topics that are conversations that are brewing in our community. And the sound, you can see how we feel by just listening to it. And the chaotic state of the music kind of matches the chaotic state of the uprising.\"With songs such as \"Lament for George Floyd\" and \"Arrest the Cops who Murdered Breonna Taylor,\" Jones and Kashperko did not mince words when it came to voicing their thoughts on the racial injustice that stemmed from those two incidents. The piercing notes and virtuosic timbres let you know where they stand and that they are serious about seeking justice.There are also quite a few songs that reference the COVID-19 pandemic (\"Social Distancing,\" \"Safer @ Home Orders\"...). Jones and Kashperko are just two of the many people who have been affected both professionally and mentally by the pandemic. During the shutdown, both musicians were unable to perform and bring in the income that normally comes from live performances. Jones and Kashperko were both going through a deep depression and found the recording sessions for the album to be cathartic because it provided a creative outlet for the group to express themselves. The music, Jones says, \"saved me from my own insanity.\"\"We were both in search of a sound that could really encapsulate how we felt and what we were going through creatively. At this point we were not obligated to make any specific type of music, we were free to do anything we want. We are not musicians for hire, so we were liberated to let our imagination run wild.\"Over the course of a two week period, Anti-Philosophy went into the studio and came out with several albums worth of material. Their political discourses are what triggered the innovative sound they developed. They stumbled upon a unique formula of creating a simple melody line and then just going crazy with it.The first LP,serves as more of an experiment of what the group could accomplish creatively in terms of forming a new genre.While the sound is very much influenced by protest music and jazz, the group says the music is \"unapologetically Black,\" and it is music for the future.\"The message that you are making today is not going to be interpreted until tomorrow. We are making this music as a protest, but this is also a warning of like, in the future please don't let this happen again,\" says Jones.\"Don't let our climate get so bad that an entire continent is on fire. Try not to poison Black cities' water like they did in Flint. Lets not have Black bodies shown on social media as being killed like its daily news. It's a protest but it's not singularly a protest.\"Throughout the volumes, there will be an evolution of sounds that sonically represents opposition but also a call to action as solutions are starting to take place.The next volume, titled,, will be more politically charged and focus on the stimulus and the election. Look for it to be released before the end of the year.Even though it's only been a few weeks sincedropped, the group says they have been getting positive responses from musicians and the public, who felt the album hit close to home and they were able to identify with the abrasive sound.Over the course of the next few months, Anti-Philosophy plans to push a wave of songs into the universe.They are not looking for accolades, but if anything they want their music to make people think and to generate heavy discussions about how messed up this world is.\"We are literally making this music because we love art, not because we are trying to win a Grammy or trying to make money,\" says Jones. \"It was this genuine passion for the creative process and out of that genuine effort something really beautiful emerged that we can proudly say came out of Detroit and it comes from what we experienced as Detroiters.\"", "title": "Detroit jazz duo Anti-Philosophy make music for these tumultuous times", "dataset": "['manual_google_by_location']", "labels": "['entertainment', 'indirect_city_relation']", "annot_city": "['Detroit']"}, {"id": 8827, "city": null, "url": "https://www.deadlinedetroit.com/articles/26810/detroiter_bribed_homeless_woman_with_coney_for_help_in_fraud_scheme", "text": "\n\nDavid Budd.

This compromise provides a path forward toward a better San Diego providing more homes for San Diegans.\u201cThe new licensing, regulations, and enforcement will improve the quality of life across our city. I look forward to working with city staff on reviewing the Commissioner\u2019s amendments to this plan and bringing forward the best version possible to Council so we can pass lasting and reasonable regulations.\u201d\u201cThe ordinance will make everybody unhappy, which is our only successful option,\u201d said commissioner Vicki Granowitz. \u201cIt is not realistic to think that how land use worked 20 years ago will work today. Following the existing rules means things will continue to go unregulated. This compromise at least starts to deal with some of the problems. This ordinance will allow us to review it and make changes.\u201d\u201cThis is an incredibly difficult and polarizing issue,\u201d noted commissioner Kelly Moden, who characterized the tackling of it as \u201cvery courageous.\u201d\u201cWe need regulations to be put in place so we can have enforcement, which we don\u2019t have now,\u201d said commission chair William Hofman.Commission vice chair James Whalen noted they received more than 200 written public comments, the majority opposed to Campbell\u2019s compromise.\u201cBut we also need to consider that a lot of people are depending on the income from renting out their homes,\u201d Whalen said. \u201cThe challenge comes in dealing with those who are doing [short-term rentals] as a business.\u201dSeveral beach-area residents testified at the Dec. 3 commission Zoom hearing.Gary Wonacott of Mission Beach testified against the compromise proposal.\u201cSpeculators and investors will take over Mission Beach with a carve out,\u201d he argued.Another opponent from La Jolla dubbed the compromise plan as a \u201cTrojan horse\u201d calling it an invitation to \u201cput hotels in every neighborhood, which will become hotel circles.\u201dPacific Beach activist Tom Coat liked the compromise plan. \u201cEnforcing the code is not a workable solution,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need a solution now.\u201dJohn Thickstun of La Jolla said the commission\u2019s questions from its previous continued meeting in October were not properly addressed.\u201cThe commission raised eight questions, and not one of them has been changed in any way since the last meeting,\u201d Thickstun said adding, \u201cShort-term rentals are currently illegal under the (City) municipal code.\u201dAndrea Schlageter, Ocean Beach Planning Board chair, described the current compromise proposal as \u201ca giveaway to investors who may or may not be residents of San Diego.\u201d She suggested Short-term rentals should be channeled away from residential areas and into commercial zones.Back in October, following a presentation by Molina, commissioners had asked City staff to address several questions they had concerning licensing and implementation of the proposed ordinance before returning to them for final action.The issue will be now forwarded to the City Council \u2013 which will have five of nine new board members \u2013 for review and action sometime next year.", "title": "City Planning Commission supports proposed short term rental ordinance", "dataset": "['manual_google_by_location']", "labels": "['housing', 'policy']", "annot_city": "['San Diego']"}, {"id": 8838, "city": null, "url": "https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/courts/story/2020-12-06/san-diego-da-investigating-at-least-5-million-in-suspected-unemployment-fraud-by-local-inmates", "text": "The San Diego County District Attorney\u2019s Office is investigating inmates in local jails and the state prison for committing as much as $5 million in unemployment benefits fraud, part of an emerging statewide scandal of widespread fraud by prisoners totaling at least $400 million and likely far more.\n\nIn a statement, Public Affairs Officer Tanya Sierra said the agency is in the \u201cvery early stages\u201d of investigation into the benefits program administered by the state Employment Development Department.\n\n\u201cWhile the complete scope of the fraud is not clear at this time, early indications are that as much as $5 million in fraudulent payments were made to inmates at the RJ Donovan Correctional Institution alone,\u201d she wrote in the statement Friday, referring to the state prison in Otay Mesa.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNews of the probe comes just days after state officials revealed $400 million in unemployment benefit claims were wrongly paid to state prison inmates, including more than 100 condemned prisoners on death row.\n\nOn Thursday, San Diego County District Attorney Summer Stephan signed on to a letter, along with eight other district attorneys, to Gov. Gavin Newsom, contending that as much as $1 billion in payments may have been sent out of state \u2014 and that the total fraud from the scam might grow even larger.\n\nLocally, investigators from the DA\u2019s office are working with the county Sheriff\u2019s Department, the state prison system and EDD to uncover how much fraud has occurred here at both Donovan and the county jails, and \u201cidentify suspects and determine what evidence exists that can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt and lead to appropriate criminal charges,\u201d Sierra said.\n\nShe could not say how many inmates may have been involved. Stephan said that it will also take time to unravel the extent of the scheme.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s outrageous that taxpayers will be on the hook for these fraudulent payments and that a system was not in place earlier to alert authorities and prevent such fraud,\u201d Stephan said. \u201cA forensic investigation will take time and resources but is necessary to hold individuals responsible for gaming the system at a time when our economy and our communities are already hurting amid the ongoing pandemic.\u201d\n\nIn the letter Stephan and her colleagues wrote they had received \u201cunverified information that EDD has distributed at least $1 billion to out-of-state claimants.\u201d The letter called on Newsom to give the district attorneys emergency funds to investigate and prosecute the fraud, and have state agencies join forces with an existing federal task force and a statewide task force of local DAs that have been investigating for months.\n\nIt also asked for an order allowing the cross-matching of inmate data such as Social Security numbers, names and birthdays with EDD claims, to sort out bogus payments. They urged Newsom to use his sweeping power under the state Emergency Services Act, which gives the governor broad authority during a state of emergency and which was invoked at the start of the pandemic in March, to order that cross-matching.\n\n\u201cThere is perhaps no greater need to protect the resources of the state than to immediately prohibit payment of unemployment benefit claims made in the names of state, federal and local inmates,\u201d the prosecutors wrote. \u201cFurthermore, there is critical and urgent need to provide financial assistance to those legally entitled to these benefits.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWith the significant backlog of EDD claims pending, immediately implementing a cross-match system will expedite and assist in aiding the payment of legitimate claims to those in urgent need of financial assistance.\u201d\n\nThe letter said there is a belief among state agencies that state laws and regulations prohibit the sharing of this data among agencies. The letter said that is incorrect, but added that if there are any limitations to sharing the data they can be swept aside via an executive order under the emergency powers law.\n\nWithout action now, the district attorneys said they were concerned the fraud could grow \u201cexponentially.\u201d\n\nThe allegation that funds have been sent out of state comes at a time when the EDD is under intense criticism for not issuing payments to hundreds of thousands of state residents with valid claims stemming from the economic devastation caused by the pandemic and resulting lockdowns.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe fact that an out-of-state payment has been issued is not evidence it is fraudulent, since some residents may have lost their job, made a claim and since moved out of state temporarily. Prosecutors say the cross-matching will allow them to begin to separate out legitimate claims from bogus ones.\n\nSome prosecutors who have been investigating the scheme said it might be the biggest taxpayer fraud in state history. The depth and breadth is not known yet, but some counties have said how many inmates they suspect could be involved.\n\nIn Amador County, the district attorney there told the Los Angeles Times some 500 inmates at Mule Creek State Prison may have accounted for up to $2 million in claims. Riverside County DA Michael Hestrin said some 1,500 inmates there could be involved and his office is still unraveling the extent. In Lassen County, District Attorney Susan Melyssah Rios told The Times that 900 inmates at Mule Creek State Prison are implicated in $4 million in fraud, so far.", "title": "San Diego DA investigating at least $5 million in suspected unemployment fraud by local inmates", "dataset": "['manual_google_by_location']", "labels": "['not_sure']", "annot_city": "['San Diego']"}, {"id": 8839, "city": null, "url": "https://timesofsandiego.com/business/2020/12/05/average-san-diego-county-gas-price-drops-slightly/", "text": "Share This Article:\n\nThe average price of a gallon of self-serve regular gasoline in San Diego County dropped four-tenths of a cent Saturday to $3.152, one day after decreasing one-tenth of a cent.\n\nSupport Times of San Diego's growth\n\nwith a small monthly contribution Become a supporter\n\nThe average price is three-tenths of a cent less than one week ago and 62.8 cents lower than one year ago but one-tenth of a cent more than month ago, according to figures from the AAA and Oil Price Information Service.

Elliott slideshow\n\nThe San Diego City Attorney\u2019s Office has filed criminal charges against a man accused of harassing multiple women at the Westfield Mission Valley shopping mall and holding some against their will by climbing under their cars and refusing to come out. Three misdemeanor counts were filed against Orlando J. Chavez of San Diego: two for false imprisonment, and one for criminal assault and battery.\n\nChavez approached most of his victims in the parking lot of the mall, according to the court filings. He reportedly grabbed one woman by the arm and told her, \u201cYou can flatten me out any time.\u201d He followed another woman into her workplace, and approached yet another victim as she waited to pick up her children at school. He was investigated for stalking that woman for nearly two years, and slashing the tires of her husband\u2019s car, according to police.\n\n\u201cEveryone has the right to feel safe when going to work, shopping, or picking up their children at school,\u201d City Attorney Mara W.

The first incident cited in the court filings took place in 2018, and the most recent on Aug. 13.\n\nIn one of the more recent cases he told a woman and her supervisor, whom the victim had called for help, \u201cYou girls are so pretty and should come with me,\u201d according to the police report. One of the incidents was even observed by an off-duty San Diego Police Officer, who saw Chavez climb under a woman\u2019s car. The officer ordered Chavez to come out from under the car at least five times before he did, then yelled that he wasn\u2019t doing anything wrong, got into his truck and drove away. At least twice Chavez reportedly harassed women and then followed them in his truck as they drove out of the parking lot.\n\nChavez, who is 72 years old, has a criminal record with multiple convictions for crimes including weapons violations and burglary.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Park and the Mall, a park along the Midtown Greenway in Uptown. The three encampments account for 53 tents, up from the 37 that were counted on Nov. 18, Bangoura said.\n\nEncampments have been in city parks since the summer, when people began moving to Powderhorn Park in south Minneapolis after the uprising following the killing of George Floyd. They spread to more than 40 park sites during the summer, after which the Park Board voted to reduce the number of permitted sites where people could stay.\n\nHaving encampments during the winter could result in tent fires from people using propane and setting bonfires, Bangoura said. It happened at the Mall twice and at an encampment in St. Paul last week, when a recreational vehicle parked at the encampment caught fire.\n\nLast week, outreach workers asked encampment residents if they were interested in five shelter beds that were available, Bangoura said. Residents at all three encampments said no.\n\n\u201cIt is extremely concerning that most of our offers over the last two months have been declined by those living in the parks,\u201d Bangoura said, adding that Hennepin County would not hold more beds that week because of the cold and existing demand.\n\nEarlier, Park Board officials had signaled that the encampments would be cleared by October before the freezing weather returned. Most of them have been disbanded, with some dwellers going to shelters, hotels or pitching their tents elsewhere.\n\nNew shelters are expected to open this month, including beds for Native Americans near the Franklin Avenue light-rail station and inside the Strong Tower Parish in northeast Minneapolis.

Public comments have been pouring into City Hall about whether to redirect some of the Police Department\u2019s funding.\n\nAdvocates for a smaller department see it as a crucial opportunity to divert police resources into mental health services and alternative responses to nonviolent emergency calls. Others say they support funding those initiatives, but will not sacrifice police spending amid a worrisome spike in carjackings, homicides and other crimes.\n\nThe issue of policing has opened a gaping divide on the City Council, and a vote could come as early as Monday, even as some members appear entrenched in their positions.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if the goal should be common ground,\u201d Council Member Steve Fletcher said last week. \u201cI think we might disagree on some things and it might be good to vote that way and just show people where we are.\u201d\n\nIn recent days, Minneapolis\u2019 elected leaders were consumed by the issue as they weighed competing public safety proposals and sat through nearly eight hours of emotional public testimony.\n\nOn Nov. 27, Fletcher, Council President Lisa Bender and Council Member Phillipe Cunningham previewed a plan to take nearly $8 million from Mayor Jacob Frey\u2019s recommended 2021 budget for the Police Department and use it to pay for mental health crisis teams, violence prevention programs and other initiatives.\n\nFrey called the proposal \u201cirresponsible,\u201d saying he supported the concepts, but that they should not be paid for from the Police Department\u2019s already crimped budget.\n\nThe debate comes amid a national reckoning over racism and policing sparked by Floyd\u2019s death in May. The City Council drew widespread attention when a majority of its members pledged this summer to \u201cbegin the process of ending the Minneapolis Police Department.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard for people to imagine something different beyond policing when all they know is the police state,\u201d said Miski Noor of Black Visions, a driving force behind the push to reduce the department\u2019s funding. \u201cWe do have the power to actually bring our own imaginings, our own conjurings to life, around structures that could fully keep all of us safe.\u201d\n\nNoor worries some of the city\u2019s leaders are \u201cfeeding into the fearmongering and the outright lies and misinformation around increased violence.\u201d\n\nMore than 500 people have been shot in Minneapolis this year, according to Police Department statistics. There were more than 125 carjackings in two months.\n\nAfter 23 years living in north Minneapolis, Sondra Samuels says she has never experienced crime like she has this year. It\u2019s spurred some of her neighbors to seek therapy or anti-anxiety medications, she said. Multiple shootings have directly affected people she knows.\n\n\u201cPolicing is not going to solve all of our crime and safety issues. But we also know that without it, at the height of crime and safety issues, your citizens will remain unsafe,\u201d said Samuels, who is president of the Northside Achievement Zone. \u201cMore are going to die, more are going to be carjacked.\u201d\n\nSamuels wants to see a \u201cboth-and\u201d approach to the problem that funds the Police Department while providing more services like mental health and housing support. To help reform the department, she says the state must change arbitration rules so the chief can more easily terminate bad cops.\n\n\u201cWhat they\u2019re trying to do is to dismantle the police. And in so doing they are dismantling the city,\u201d Samuels said.\n\nA Star Tribune/MPR News/KARE 11 poll of Minneapolis residents this summer found that 40% of residents supported reducing the size of the city\u2019s Police Department. But nearly two-thirds supported redirecting some department funding to social services. Since more than three-quarters of the department\u2019s budget pays for salaries, wages and fringe benefits, however, it is challenging to redirect funding without reducing the size of the force.\n\nCompeting ideas\n\nFrey is pitching a roughly $1.5 billion spending plan for the city that includes $179 million for the Police Department. That\u2019s about $14 million less than the city initially approved for 2020, in part because the city is trying to reduce spending amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe plan written by Bender, Fletcher and Cunningham would primarily use money earmarked for officer overtime to redirect an additional nearly $8 million. The details of these new mental health teams remain fuzzy. Some are advocating the creation of a fund to run public safety pilot programs, saying they wanted to have more detailed plans in place before launching efforts like new mental health crisis teams.\n\nA slower approach with more planning is supported by some experts in the field.\n\n\u201cThis vague language makes it really hard to understand,\u201d said Sue Abderholden, executive director of NAMI Minnesota.\n\nHer organization is encouraging city officials to expand mental health crisis teams that already exist, such as Hennepin County\u2019s COPE program, as opposed to creating new ones.\n\nMeanwhile on Thursday, Frey and local business leaders announced the creation of a new, private fund to help support efforts to change public safety. Frey described it as an effort to implement some of the council members\u2019 ideas, without cutting police funding.\n\nBender said in a public meeting Friday that she also hopes they will make changes during the city\u2019s budgeting process, and not rely solely on outside organizations.\n\n\u201cI would feel pretty heartbroken if we couldn\u2019t find a way to increase our investments in gun violence prevention from city funds ... when we\u2019re investing in so many other things,\u201d she said.\n\nSo far, advocates on both sides are standing firm, and frustration abounds.\n\n\u201cThis proposal is the bare minimum that council members should support after MPD murdered George Floyd and our city rose up,\u201d Zola Richardson, of advocacy group Reclaim the Block, said in a statement. On the other side, the anti-crime group Operation Safety Now, says this is not the time to cut police funding. Eric Won, one of the group\u2019s leaders, said a fundamental problem is that society hasn\u2019t reviewed the role of police since the 1960s.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think we have the capacity at this time to look at the problem in a more organic fashion, build it up from the beginning,\u201d Won said. \u201cOne thing we can\u2019t do is turn off the engine on this airplane, because we\u2019re flying.

The plan\u2019s central argument is that the city needs more homes, especially since Minneapolis doesn\u2019t have sufficient affordable and supportive housing for our most vulnerable community members. Decades of racist and exclusionary zoning policies have made Minneapolis one of the most segregated cities in the United States. These same zoning policies allowed the richest and whitest wards of the city to avoid building their fair share of housing. This drove development into low-income neighborhoods. The mayor and a majority of the city council, along with many neighborhood organizations, and nonprofits all agree that Minneapolis needs more housing. The 2040 plan should have created an environment where desperately needed homes could be built. So why has the 2040 Plan\u2019s cap on the numbers of stories in residential zones interfered with the construction of three dedicated affordable housing complexes in a neighborhood that strongly supported the proposals?\n\nWhittier is a thoroughly mixed-income neighborhood, in spite of its recent reputation for rampant market-rate development and gentrification. Almost half of residents are considered \u201crent-burdened\u201d\u2014meaning they spend over 30% of their income on rent\u2014which is a good indicator there is not enough affordable housing located in the neighborhood. Earlier in the summer, unsheltered neighbors camped long-term in Washburn Fair Oaks Park and at the end of Nicollet Avenue until they were forcibly evicted by the police. Although there are already two shelters operating in Whittier, there is a clear need for more long-term and transitional housing for our unhoused neighbors.\n\nIn light of the need for more affordable and transitional housing in Whittier, several organizations proposed developing affordable homes and transitional housing in the neighborhood earlier this year. They include a Simpson Housing project that will be a five-story building with two floors reserved for emergency shelter and two floors for permanent affordable housing. Nonprofit developer Common Bond and St. Stephen\u2019s Human Services also proposed building affordable and supportive housing in the neighborhood. These three proposals in Whittier aim to create over 120 new dedicated affordable homes and over 70 shelter beds, and are currently blocked. These buildings are surrounded by permitted construction sites for four or five story buildings, but the new affordable projects are limited to three stories due to the 2040 plan definition of Interior 3 that includes most of the Whittier, Philips, Dinkytown, and Wedge neighborhoods. Without an additional story, dozens of homes and shelter beds will not be built, and the subsidy for each person housed will be bigger. It\u2019s possible this limit may cause one or both of the projects to fall though, and no one will be housed. The proposals were enthusiastically supported by residents, neighborhood organizations, and other community members, and are sorely needed so that vulnerable community members can enjoy the stability of a quality, affordable home. Those supporters were told that because of the cap of three stories in Minneapolis 2040, the plan would have to be amended before the affordable homes could be approved.\n\nOf these three proposed affordable housing developments, only Simpson Housing has managed to successfully amend Minneapolis 2040. This amendment has allowed the developers to build a five story building \u2013 one that would have been allowed prior to implementation of Minneapolis 2040. Now, height above three stories isn\u2019t allowed, even for dedicated affordable housing. This is true in spite of the mayor\u2019s and city council\u2019s stance that these neighborhoods need more supportive and affordable housing.\n\nFortunately, the Simpson Housing development was able to navigate the amendment process to get an amendment and build the affordable homes they planned. But the complex, months-long process raises concerns that other neighborhood organizations, like Common Bond and St. Stephens, won\u2019t be able to build affordable and supportive housing projects that are currently in the pipeline, even though they comply with the former height limits in the neighborhood.\n\nA cap that limits new buildings to three stories in parts of Whittier delayed the production of 124 affordable homes and over 70 beds of emergency shelter, against the wishes of the neighborhood and affordable housing advocates. These limits are actually lower than they were in pre-2040 Plan zoning regulations. In one neighborhood, in one year, lower height limits have impacted three separate affordable housing projects. If left unchanged these rules will continue to block affordable housing projects all across the city of Minneapolis. We must fix these proposed rules before they are adopted. The affordable housing incentive in Interior 3 needs to allow an extra story on the condition of providing affordable homes.\n\nPlease take two actions. First, comment on the proposed Built Form Rezoning Study. Second, contact the planning commissioners. Ask them to allow for an affordable housing Premium that allows the same affordable buildings as were allowed prior to the 2040 Plan. We must make sure the rules implementing Minneapolis 2040 live up to the promises of the plan: allowing more people to live near transit and amenities, and giving everyone access to an affordable home. If the final version of the 2040 Plan contains rules that block four and five story affordable homes, even in neighborhoods where they were previously legal to build, Minneapolis 2040 will fail.\n\nShare this: Email\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nReddit\n\n", "title": "Why are Building Height Limits in Minneapolis 2040 Delaying Affordable Housing in Whittier?", "dataset": "['manual_google_by_location']", "labels": "['planning_&_design', 'housing']", "annot_city": "['Minneapolis']"}, {"id": 8851, "city": null, "url": "https://kstp.com/news/minneapolis-city-leaders-continue-debate-police-funding-time-ticks-down-on-full-budget-vote/5941894/", "text": "The \u201cSafety for All\u201d plan is an 11-part amendment to the mayor's proposed budget.\n\nMinneapolis city councilmembers propose 'Safety for All' budget plan to revamp city's public safety system\n\nIt reduces the number of police officers from 770 to 750 after next year. it also cuts nearly $8 million from the department and moves those funds to crisis management and crime prevention programs.

Unfortunately, HART had to eliminate that service by 2017 since there was not enough ridership to serve that route, according to Plan Hillsborough.\n\nHowever, Lott said when he rode the route during that time, it took more than an hour to get to Downtown Tampa.\n\n\u201cThe individuals in the city, who would be a larger user, would drive out of the city to a church lot\u2026 It would zig-zag down and go down through Brandon and S.R. 60 and then back to downtown,\" Lott told fellow Hillsborough Metropolitan Planning Organization leaders at a meeting on December 1, 2020.\n\nHe said that the whole route took more than an hour, which is just too long.\n\n\u201cNo one expects to be on a bus for over an hour to get from Plant City to Downtown Tampa,\u201d Lott said.\n\nIn speaking with citizens, Lott said the big desire now is express service from Downtown Plant City to Downtown Tampa.\n\nLott said local leaders have already been looking at a few possible sites as a connection in the I-4 corridor route.\n\n\u201cEven though we have more people coming to Plant City to work than leave, we still have a large population that comes to the Downtown Tampa and West Shore area,\u201d Lott said.\n\nIf you look at Plant City, we are now a little over 42,000 people within city limits. However, within the metro area, there are 125,000 people, according to Lott.\n\nHe said there is a desire to discuss an option of an \u201con-demand\u201d service, similar to the Downtowner in Downtown Tampa.\n\nOther Hillsborough County leaders agree the more transportation in the Plant City area is critical to maintaining and supporting jobs and the economy.\n\n\u201cPeople who do not have a car are not able to get to work or do many of the things that they need to do,\u201d said Commissioner Kimberly Overman of Hillsborough County. \u201cAs Plant City has grown and invested a great deal of effort in bringing jobs into the city area, it\u2019s critically important that those individuals who do not have a vehicle are able to go to work.\u201d\n\nHowever, funding remains a stumbling block. The operating costs for the proposed express route, among other new transit options for Plant City, are supposed to be paid for with the All for Transportation Tax Money that voters approved back in 2018.\n\nThat money remains tied up in a legal battle as Hillsborough County awaits a decision from the state's supreme court.", "title": "Plant City families hoping for new express bus route to Downtown Tampa", "dataset": "['manual_google_by_location']", "labels": "['transportation']", "annot_city": "['Tampa']"}, {"id": 8858, "city": null, "url": "https://www.fox13news.com/news/suspect-in-murder-of-80-year-old-tampa-woman-arrested-deputies-say", "text": "article\n\nThe man accused of fatally shooting an 80-year-old woman in Tampa earlier in the week was arrested, deputies announced Friday morning.\n\nThe Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office said 61-year-old Timmy Allen Keene was located and booked in Polk County Jail.

Rents in the new complex will start around $1,400.\n\nRelated also \u201cdoes intend to bring a national/regional grocer to the project,\u201d Milo said.\n\nIn an interview with the Tampa Bay Business Journal, Related president Jon Paul \u201cJP\u201d Perez said it would be a Publix.

Other aspects of the West River redevelopment project are also aimed toward that same goal, including the future construction of a multi-tenant office building, and possibly a hotel, south of Main Street, he said.\n\nThis newest phase of development follows the rehabilitation of the 150-unit Mary Bethune High Rise Apartments and the ground-breaking of the three Boulevard Towers, which each have at least 80 percent of their units priced for lower-income residents. Those three towers are still under construction, and other residential buildings are scheduled to begin construction within the next three to six months said Milo, of Related Group.\n\nAll in all, there are nearly 1800 units that are either under contract, funded completely or \u201cwill be reasonably funded within the next year,\u201d Moore said, including 820 public housing units plus a mix of market-rate and affordable housing.\n\nMuch of the new construction is in the space left behind by the now-demolished North Boulevard Homes public housing project that used to occupy the area. Other projects on nearby land owned by the city could add to the total number of new housing units, Moore said.\n\nTimes staff writers Sara DiNatale and Christopher O\u2019Donnell contributed to this report.", "title": "Is a new Publix part of next phase of Tampa\u2019s West River project?", "dataset": "['manual_google_by_location']", "labels": "['planning_&_design']", "annot_city": "['Tampa']"}, {"id": 8860, "city": null, "url": "https://www.tampabayparenting.com/article/a-new-way-to-see-tampa-bay-a-family-cargo-bike/", "text": "Exploring Tampa on a bike just got a lot easier for my family. We laugh together as we ride to Hyde Park Village, The Riverwalk, Armature Works and Julian B. Lane Riverfront Park. We ride at the same pace. I can see them all the time and no one is left behind. That\u2019s because we are riding together on a Bunch Family Cargo Bike.\n\nThis family adventure started when I was driving down a South Tampa street and saw a man pedaling along effortlessly on what looked like a bike with a bucket in the front. In it were two kids strapped in with seat belts. I\u2019ll never forget the contagious smiles on the kids\u2019 faces. My mouth dropped open. I slowly followed them in our car until it was safe enough to ask the magic question, \u201cWhere did you get that bike?\u201d Little did I know that soon, I would be answering that same question for others.\n\nYou see, I am a mommy who loves family travel. In fact, for the last eight years I\u2019ve used my journalism skills to make videos inspiring families to travel the world with their children. It\u2019s my passion! But 2020 obviously had a different plan for us. I wondered how as a family we could still enjoy exploring new places together in a socially distanced and safe way. I had visions of my kids smiling and laughing too. We couldn\u2019t bike very far if we got individual bikes, since my littlest one is still learning. And, honestly, I hadn\u2019t ridden a bike for an extended length of time in years.\n\nI did my research on Family Cargo Bikes and decided to get a Bunch Bike with electric assist. The Bunch Family Cargo Bike has a wooden cargo box in the front with bench seats facing each other and enough seatbelts to safely seat four children. There\u2019s cargo space underneath the seats for groceries or anything you pick up along the way. It has electric assist which obviously makes it easy to ride. It has 5-levels of speed but trust me, the 48v battery has so much power you probably won\u2019t go past three. Once I ordered the bike from the Texas company, it arrived in a few weeks already assembled and delivered to my front door. It was an investment, but one of the best I\u2019ve ever made. We aren\u2019t spending all our time in the car anymore, because we can use the family cargo bike for small errands too. It will travel 35 miles on a single charge.\n\nThis family purchase couldn\u2019t have come at a better time. The city of Tampa recently announced they received a grant for a major expansion of the Riverwalk which will include new bike lanes stretching to nearby neighborhoods. And personally, for us it was a life saver. We wanted to explore together again in a safe way and now we are doing it in our own city. So be on the lookout for us as we zoom by you with smiles on our faces. If we are going too fast to answer you, I\u2019ll just tell you now: It\u2019s called a \u201cBunch Bike.\u201d\n\nFOLLOW: Facebook @TheGreatEscapePlan | Instagram @TheGreatEscapePlan1", "title": "A New Way to See Tampa Bay: A Family Cargo Bike", "dataset": "['manual_google_by_location']", "labels": "['indirect_city_relation', 'bicycle']", "annot_city": "['Tampa']"}, {"id": 8861, "city": null, "url": "https://www.tampabay.com/news/crime/2020/12/04/tampa-men-now-face-federal-charges-in-october-robberies/", "text": "TAMPA \u2014 A federal grand jury has indicted two men accused of conducting a series of armed robberies in Tampa and Hillsborough County in October.\n\nThe indictments were recently unsealed against Jeffrey Davis Jr., 22, and Tyee Spike II, 18, the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in Tampa announced Friday.\n\nThe two men were first arrested on state charges, but court records show those charges were dropped Thursday by the Hillsborough State Attorney\u2019s Office.

Eventually, the young man decided to take Lawson up on that offer. So Lawson called the city's Support Team Assistance Response truck, which pairs a mental-health worker with a paramedic; the STAR team soon came to pick up Jesse and take him to a crisis center, where he could work with staff to contact out-of-state relatives.\n\n\"I felt really good about the interaction and feel good that we were able to help him take the next step to bettering his situation,\" says Lawson. \"I\u2019m proud of Jesse, because he had the courage to discuss his struggles and his situation, and he was willing to listen to and consider the options we were sharing with him.\"\n\nEXPAND The Early Intervention Team meets for a debrief before going out each morning and after spending the day doing outreach. Conor McCormick-Cavanagh\n\nA second man at the encampment decided to accept an offer from another Human Services worker to spend the night at a homeless shelter at the Denver Coliseum.\n\nThe Human Services workers are part of the Early Intervention Team, a new city initiative. For the past month, team members have been visiting encampments that have just popped up, usually gatherings of five tents or fewer, with the goal of nipping them in the bud before they grow larger.\n\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic descended on Colorado in March, homeless encampments in Denver have increased in both number and size. This past summer, encampments grew to massive sizes in Lincoln Park in front of the Capitol and around Morey Middle School in Capitol Hill, eventually leading to sweeps by Denver police and other city employees and contractors.\n\nDespite protests and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines advising municipalities not to perform sweeps so as not to further spread COVID-19, the city has continued to clear encampments. Denver is currently facing a federal lawsuit over these sweeps during the pandemic.\n\nAnd encampments have continued to pop up throughout the city.\n\nIn September, during a series of meetings with his chief of staff, Alan Salazar, and Murphy Robinson, the executive director of Public Safety, Mayor Michael Hancock expressed his belief that the city needed to get innovative in the way it was dealing with encampments.\n\n\"I want to make sure we have alternative responses other than just going to these large encampments. We have to be able to meet folks where they\u2019re at with services to meet their needs and before small encampments turn into larger ones,\" Robinson recalls the mayor saying.\n\nWith that mandate, Robinson tapped Armando Saldate to oversee a team that would focus on this challenge. Saldate, a former Phoenix cop and onetime FBI agent who tracked financial transactions of terrorist organizations, had been with the Denver Department of Public Safety for two and a half years; prior to that, Saldate worked on internal affairs and data-science issues in the Denver Sheriff Department.\n\nSaldate issued calls for city employees to volunteer to be part of the new program; some specialists were assigned. Lawson, for example, came to the team as the lead for the Human Services component; he'd previously worked on child-welfare issues. The budget for the project came from a reallocation of resources from other departments, too.\n\nThe Early Intervention Team was launched at the end of October, following two weeks of training that included a session on how to ease into a discussion with those living in encampments from Chris Conner, director of homelessness resolution at the Department of Housing Stability, which coordinates the city's work on homelessness issues.\n\nThe initial focus has been in District 6 of the Denver Police Department, which includes such neighborhoods as Capitol Hill, the Golden Triangle, LoDo and Five Points. During business hours on weekdays, between fifteen and twenty city employees assigned to the Early Intervention Team from the departments of Public Safety, Human Services, Fire and the DPD, as well as some substance-abuse navigators from Denver Health, hit the streets. They split into four or five sub-units and head out in unmarked Toyota Priuses to visit small encampments.\n\nThe team takes a largely non-enforcement approach, trying to connect with those staying there and directing them toward services and more stable living conditions.\n\nDuring the first month of operation, the team hasn't had a lot of success getting individuals to agree to help. Some people aren't interested in chatting. Or if they want to chat, they're not interested in services at the moment, says Saldate.\n\nBut they keep trying. No one expected this to be easy.\n\nEXPAND Workers with the city's Support Team Assistance Response (STAR) truck respond to calls from the Early Intervention Team. Conor McCormick-Cavanagh\n\n\"Building relationships, rapport, trust and respect is and will continue to be the foundation of our outreach efforts and are critically important,\" explains Lawson.\n\nOn that cold Tuesday, Lawson and other members of the Early Intervention Team visited another encampment at Acoma Street and Fifth Avenue. There were around seven tents at the location, an increase from the two spotted there just three weeks earlier.\n\nLawson spent over twenty minutes talking with a middle-aged man named Damion who was staying in a tent. As he had with Jesse, Lawson told Damion about the option of staying in a shelter. But most of the conversation was casual, as the two passionately debated who was greater, LeBron James or Michael Jordan.\n\nDamion ended up staying at the encampment, declining the proposed offering of shelter for the night.\n\nLawson plans to follow up with Damion over the next few days. \"Building that relationship comes down to multiple things. It comes down to talking to people, getting to know them, listening to their stories, listening to their situations, and helping where you can and are invited to help,\" he says. \"It comes down to following through with what you say you\u2019re going to do. It\u2019s not always easy for someone to talk to us right off the bat. We have to follow through with what we say we\u2019re going to do. I try to find ways to connect with people because I genuinely care about them and want them to be successful.\"\n\nBut he also knows that the man might be moving on soon, since DPD officers had gone to the encampment the night before he visited and told its residents that they would have to clear out.\n\nThat's the \"current policy landscape\" that the team needs to work within, says Conner, who's continued advising its members since he provided initial training with the Department of Housing Stability.\n\n\"An outreach worker can\u2019t issue a lawful order,\" he notes, \"but lawful orders are going to be made around encampments, so it's important being there, adding a presence there where it\u2019s like, 'I\u2019m not here telling you what to do. I\u2019m not here being the boss and telling you that you have to move. I\u2019m here to tell you that we need a plan here, and being resourceful as I can be to help contemplate what that plan can be for you.'\"\n\nSome of the smaller encampments visited by the Early Intervention Team pop up after sweeps of large encampments. The day before the Early Intervention Team visited the sites by Denver Health, the City of Denver had swept a large homeless encampment in RiNo.\n\n\"We are going to see displacement from that location,\" Saldate says.\n\nThe Early Intervention Team isn't involved in sweeps. Instead, as the name implies, it takes an earlier, easier approach. \"We don't touch anything,\" Saldate notes. \"Something that might look like trash could be treasure to someone else.\"\n\nEven as the city launched the Early Intervention Team, some nonprofit service providers have been pushing for sustained outreach at large encampments.\n\n\"The hope is that we can build up some rapport with these larger encampments and move people into housing and other spaces more quickly because we're not the city,\" says Cathy Alderman of the Colorado Coalition for the Homeless, which is partnering with Urban Peak and the St. Francis Center on the effort.\n\nStill, she appreciates the softer, non-enforcement actions of the city's Early Intervention Team. \"I think that's great if they're taking that approach,\" Alderman says.\n\nBut she also hadn't heard about the team during its first month of operation. Saldate, Robinson and other city leaders were so focused on getting the program up and running that they hadn't made a concerted effort to share the plan with all of the other entities in the city working with the homeless, Saldate says.\n\n\"That has been one of the deficiencies in the standing up of this, and then just the day-to-day operations of this. It\u2019s something that we\u2019ve talked about,\" he admits. Another thing they've talked about: Whether the team's ties to Public Safety might affect its effectiveness.\n\n\"People's concern in these encampments is often the distrust that they have of the city because the city has moved them around so much,\" Alderman explains. \"To the extent that we can collaborate, it's great. But it's also important for us to have an independent entity so it doesn't appear like we're an arm of the city.\"\n\nSaldate hopes that as the Early Intervention Team continues with its mission, others will come around.\n\n\"People equate us with enforcement, and I always have to overcome that,\" he says. \"Even with Chris Conner, there was reticence about us being involved. I\u2019m hoping to do my best to overcome that. It doesn\u2019t matter what city department is leading that effort. Safety is the one that got involved and stepped up.\"\n\nRobinson points out that he was \"the chief operating officer for the mayor before I was Public Safety director. The mayor knows that when I get a project, I get it done. It is not a fully Public Safety entity. The Public Safety personnel help run it. But it is a citywide entity that has the capability of enforcement as a last resort but is really focused on service providing. Most of the team members are not people who would do any enforcement.\"\n\nSaldate plans to reach out to service providers in the coming month to explain the team's purpose and methods. Conner says he'll be drilling down in January on how to best coordinate between the various city agencies and service providers that are all working on resolving homelessness issues.\n\n\"I think we hear a lot from protest voices that the city is an enemy or that people don\u2019t want to talk to the city, but when I\u2019m in the encampment environment, and whether it\u2019s a park ranger or employee from the Department of Transportation and Infrastructure or whether it\u2019s an officer, we\u2019re not hearing that folks won\u2019t engage with them or won\u2019t be forthcoming with what their needs are,\" Conner explains. \"In some ways, they\u2019re not getting the credit for the ways that they are able to engage.\"\n\nSaldate and others on his team recognize that not everyone is suited for shelters. For example, couples can't enter a shelter together; dog owners have to split up with their pets. Others are worried about being indoors during the pandemic. That's why Saldate is feeling optimistic about one of the ways the city is altering its approach to homelessness during the pandemic.\n\n\"We need a safe outdoor space. We need a large one,\" says Saldate. \"When we have safe outdoor spaces, we can see how effective my team might be in addressing these small encampments.\"\n\nLocal\n\nCommunity\n\nJournalism\n\nI Support Support the independent voice of Denver and help keep the future of Westword free.

There will also be periodic trash pick-up, visits by a mobile shower truck, and 24/7 staffing.\n\nSaldate thinks that his team could even set up a program on the site for people who need IDs, one of their biggest obstacles to accessing services.\n\nA second safe-camping site, with a capacity for forty people, both men and women, will be coming online later this month in a parking lot outside the Denver Community Church at East 16th Avenue and Pearl Street.\n\nAnd Saldate hopes that more will follow. \"Safe outdoor spaces will concentrate our ability to deliver services,\" he says.", "title": "Denver New Early Intervention Team Focuses on Small Encampments", "dataset": "['manual_google_by_location']", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Denver']"}, {"id": 8865, "city": null, "url": "https://denver.cbslocal.com/2020/12/06/denver-community-fridges-food/", "text": "Broncos Fall To Chiefs On Sunday NightThe Broncos fell to the Chiefs 22-16.\n\nWho Was The Broncos MVP On Sunday Night?Who was the best player in Sunday night's loss.\n\nDrew Lock Fined By Denver Broncos, Says Missing Last Week's Game 'Hurt My Heart, Hurt My Soul'As Kendall Hinton was thrusted into the starting quarterback role for the Broncos last week, the team's full-time starter was watching the blowout loss from home.\n\nCOVID In Colorado: Parents Upset After Football Championships Moved To PuebloA coronavirus hot spot and very limited capacity is riling up Colorado parents as the state football championships get underway.\n\nFormer CU Buffs Linebacker Coach Brian Cabral Talks About Nate Landman's Spectacular SeasonThe Dick Butkus Award is annually given to college football\u2019s top linebacker.

The Denver Art Museum hosted the largest Dior collection outside of France in the 74-year history of the fashion house and major fashion conglomerate, VF Corp, recently relocated its headquarters to Denver.\n\nAs Denver continues to make a name for itself in the fashion industry, it\u2019s important to take a look back. People like Jack Weil of Rockmount Ranch Wear, longtime South Broadway fashion businesses and current fashion trailblazers Florence M\u00fcller (the Denver Art Museum (DAM) Avenir Foundation Curator of Textile Art and Fashion), and local designers are all bricks within the foundation of Denver\u2019s fashion identity. Much like the pioneers of the city itself, there are modern pioneers of Denver\u2019s fashion history. It behooves us to collectively explore the cultures that formed how we, as a community, express ourselves today.\n\nRockmount Ranch Wear\n\nWhen you think of Denver fashion of years past, western wear probably comes to mind. Colorado ranchers and farmers needed functional clothing and 75 years ago, the Weil family started Rockmount Ranch Wear on Larimer Street to fill that void.\n\n\u201cWestern fashion as we know it largely began in the 1940s and movies and music helped popularize it. Early [Western] fashion started out handmade and then became commercial with Rockmount and other companies,\u201d said Steve Weil, president and chief creative officer of Rockmount, as well as Jack\u2019s grandson. He continued, \u201cThe fabrics were natural for the most part \u2014 wool, cotton and rayon. This changed with the advent of synthetic fabrics in the \u201960s and peaked with the [release of] Urban Cowboy in the early \u201980s with something very costume-like. This was when Western became mainstream for the first time.\u201d\n\nAs we look at Denver fashion and the evolution of Rockmount Ranch Wear through a modern lens, the words that come to mind are not simply \u201cnostalgia\u201d but \u201cinnovation\u201d as well. Rockmount clothing is not only featured in the Smithsonian and the Autry Museum of the American West for its significant place in history, but celebrities like Eric Clapton, Robert Plant and David Bowie were Rockmount customers. The brand\u2019s \u201cCannabis Cowboy Western Shirt,\u201d embroidered with the Mile High City\u2019s unofficial foliage, also garnered the brand national attention in recent years. It\u2019s clear that Rockmount has been reinventing itself for decades and is now a brand known, worn and sold in countries around the world. \u201cFashion is organic and evolving, same as always. Rockmount has over 100 shirt styles so there is something for everyone,\u201d said Weil.\n\nThe Influence of Florence M\u00fcller\n\nIn 2015, Florence M\u00fcller officially joined the DAM as the Avenir Foundation Curator of Textile Art and Fashion, a job that required her to relocate from France to Denver. She was familiar with our fair city as she curated the Yves Saint Laurent Retrospective at the DAM in 2012. During her first stay, M\u00fcller was impressed by the spirit of the city, noting in an interview with the DAM, \u201cDenver is a city full of fresh energy and vitality, connected with its traditional roots.\u201d As the DAM\u2019s Avenir Foundation Curator of Textile Art and Fashion, M\u00fcller oversees the Neusteter Textile Collection housed at the Textile Art Gallery. Part of her strategy is to grow the museum\u2019s collection and bring in more modern costume and fashion from the 20th and 21st centuries.\n\nM\u00fcller has a very full resume, to say the least. She is a fashion historian (specializing in the culture of fashion and history of costume), former director-curator of the Union Fran\u00e7aise des arts du Costume and associate professor at the Institut Fran\u00e7ais de la Mode. Throughout her career, M\u00fcller has curated more than 100 exhibits in Europe, Asia and the US, This includes several Dior exhibits that paved the way for the DAM\u2019s recent exhibit, the largest ever outside of Dior\u2019s home country of France.\n\nThanks to M\u00fcller\u2019s contributions to the DAM, bringing international fashion exhibits to Denver has elevated the city in the eyes of the broader fashion community. Not to mention, exhibits like Shock Wave: Japanese Fashion Design, 1980s\u201390s, Yves Saint Laurent: The Retrospective and Dior: From Paris to the World offer Denverites the opportunity to experience fashion in a way we might not otherwise have access to.\n\nIn 2012, M\u00fcller was hand-selected by Pierre Berge, Yves Saint Laurent\u2019s longtime partner and co-founder of the house, to curate Yves Saint Laurent: The Retrospective. The DAM was chosen as the only venue in the US to house this exclusive and all-encompassing exhibit. The retrospective was a look back on the designer\u2019s 40-year history and featured more than 200 haute couture garments along with numerous photographs, drawings and films. These priceless pieces illuminated the history of the designer\u2019s work and the development of his signature style.\n\nThe scale of the exhibit was immense, but the archives to choose from were even more massive. M\u00fcller whittled the exhibit collection down from 15,000 pieces to 500, while simultaneously keeping Saint Laurent\u2019s story intact. Every piece in the exhibit was flown from Paris and it took M\u00fcller and her team over two weeks to install all of the artwork, textiles and accessories. \u201cGoing through the archives was a long and passionate journey,\u201d explained M\u00fcller in her DAM interview. \u201cTo understand how this process is exceptional, you have to imagine that there is no other example of a museum devoted to one couturier with such a large archive.\u201d\n\nTo date, there have been two other YSL retrospectives in North America since 1980 \u2014 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1983 and the other in 2008, shown at the Fine Arts Museum of Montreal and San Francisco\u2019s de Young Museum. What set the Denver exhibit apart from its predecessors is the breadth of the display.\n\nFor this, M\u00fcller\u2019s intention was to show the entire Yves Saint Laurent picture \u2014 the man and the house and tell its incredible story. At the time, it seemed Denver was the best place to tell the story of a man that was larger than life. When asked about why DAM was chosen, M\u00fcller explained in an interview with the museum, \u201cDenver seems to have no limits; the sky is gigantic; the light intense. There is a strong feeling of freedom with the unlimited scale of the landscape \u2014 one can feel small in the immensity of the world.\u201d\n\nFrom the fall of 2016, through the spring of 2018, the DAM hosted another M\u00fcller-curated exhibit, called Shock Wave: Japanese Fashion Design, 1980s\u201390s. The exhibit showcased work by Japanese designers who started a fashion revolution in Paris during the 1980s and 1990s. More than 70 looks from iconic designers such as Issey Miyake, Kenzo Takada, Kansai Yamamoto, Yohji Yamamoto, Comme des Gar\u00e7ons and Junya Watanabe were featured in the exhibit. M\u00fcller played with the intersection of tradition and modernity, the influence of pop-culture on the designs, the use of oversized and abstract shapes and showcased collaborations between contemporary artists and fashion designers.\n\nMore importantly, through these designers\u2019 work, M\u00fcller demonstrated how Japanese designers interpreted the work of their European predecessors and influenced a new class of designers into the \u201890s and beyond.\n\nShock Wave was M\u00fcller\u2019s first exhibition in her current role at the DAM and showcased her pull within the fashion history world. The exhibit displayed 20 recent acquisitions for the DAM\u2019s collection and featured loans from the fashion collections of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the de Young Museum in San Francisco, as well as from local and national private lenders.\n\nLast year, the DAM hosted the largest-ever Dior exhibit in the United States and due to high demand, Dior: From Paris to the World, was extended for two additional weeks, proving Denverites have an appetite for couture fashion and iconic designers.\n\nThroughout the exhibition, M\u00fcller, was surprised by the range of attendees, attributing Denver\u2019s response to the sense of collaboration at couture fashion\u2019s core. \u201cAn audience that you wouldn\u2019t think would be attracted to [Dior] came to see the exhibit. They appreciated the beauty, the know-how, the passion, the work, the couturiers. Couture is an art form that speaks to our time. Painting is solitary, while couture is a huge team. It\u2019s collaborative.\u201d\n\nM\u00fcller explained that even though Dior\u2019s \u201cNew Look\u201d in the 1940s was a nostalgic nod to fashion\u2019s past, Christian Dior was fascinated by modernity and contemporary architecture. \u201cIf Christian Dior was still alive, exploring a new territory like Denver would have intrigued him.\u201d She went on to say that the contrast of Dior\u2019s historic silhouettes, set against a backdrop of contemporary architecture was the perfect setting for the exhibit.\n\nAccording to M\u00fcller, Denver is a fashion city in progress and will continue to grow as \u201cpeople are traveling so much these days and shopping online. People enjoy fashion here. They want to look better, they want to be fashionable and are proud of their look\u201d.\n\nThe DAM has become more internationally inclined and will likely continue to draw in more international fashion influence. This is, in large part, thanks to the work M\u00fcller has achieved in the short time she has graced our city with her presence.\n\nDenver Fashion Week\n\nForbes named DFW \u201ca trusted alternative to New York as a platform for emerging talent\u201d and all signs point to the show continuing to gain momentum. Former DFW co-producer and Denver hairstylist, Charlie Price, explained, \u201cWe are beginning to get international recognition and coverage, plus more and more designers from all over the world are reaching out to show with us.\u201d\n\nREAD: Denver Fashion Week Was Named An Alternative to New York Fashion Week By Forbes\n\nDenver designer and DFW participant, Tyne Hall, sees the show as a pillar of the art community. \u201cDFW has become a fixture, not just of Denver fashion, but of the arts and cultural scene. It has strengthened the arts in Denver and created a space for so many artists to showcase their work,\u201d she explained.\n\nDFW aims to celebrate all the artists involved \u2014 designers, hairstylists, models, photographers and makeup artists. DFW is a performance and that entertainment factor is catching on. Hall continued, \u201cI think what is really unique about DFW is the recognition of everyone in the show. You see not only the designers\u2019 work being elevated but also that of the hairstylists, makeup artists, models and photographers. It\u2019s truly a week of brilliant artistry.\u201d\n\nPrice and Hall went on to call out the unique talent of DFW designers. \u201cI love the creativity and ingenuity of Denver designers. We are always looking to be the most creative and unique rather than chasing what you see in mainstream fashion. Every designer has a sense of who they are.\u201d Price echoed this sentiment noting, \u201cI love seeing fashion designers develop their style and point of view. In Denver, I think there is an independent streak \u2014 we are in the Wild West after all.\u201d\n\nAs the event continues to grow in attendance and popularity, the national exposure of Denver\u2019s talented designers grows as well. After his near-win on Project Runway in 2010, local designer, Mondo Guerra, brought Bravo\u2019s digital spin-off show, Runway Remake, to Denver in 2019, which brought even more of a national fashion gaze onto the city. Price attributes this recognition from outside authorities to the success of DFW. \u201cIt has given local sartorial talents a unique platform on which to shine for all the world to see.\u201d\n\nDenver Fashion Week serves as a platform to uplift local designers and provide a stage for many talented people to showcase their work. As a result, local designers have the opportunity to jumpstart their careers and further cement Denver\u2019s fashion identity. Electric Bubblegum designer, Mariah Hodges, explained that she began her line here because of her family, but stayed because of the creative atmosphere. \u201cEven though I started this brand here because of family, I felt it would be a great place to grow an up-and-coming fashion brand. And Denver fashion week has been a great support!\u201d\n\nThe Future: New Designers\n\nAs outside forces continue to pour into the city, bringing new takes on food, architecture and of course, fashion, it\u2019s important to highlight the designers that continue to transform the landscape. These designers stand on the foundation of what these early pioneers built and allow this spirit to live on in their own creations.\n\nDenver fashion would not be what it is today, without the creativity of POC-owned brands and POC designers. Crystal Lee, founder of C.R. Lee, has been recognized abroad for her designs and featured on numerous runways and in fashion magazines. When Lee was starting out, she was looking to uplift women who didn\u2019t feel seen. \u201cAs a new designer, I just wanted to create the things I wish existed. That meant good quality, unique, fun and innovative ready-to-wear. At first I focused on \u2018real women\u2019. At that time \u2018real women\u2019 meant curves.\u201d Now, thanks in large part to her work, the definition of real women has expanded to mean any and all women, of all shapes and sizes. Lee has brought an international gaze upon Denver fashion, further laying the groundwork for Denver\u2019s expansion as a fashion city with a strong identity.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited about Denver fashion,\u201d said Lee. \u201cI think as Denver gets even more comfortable as a major city and with all of the migration here, I believe our fashion scene will truly be unique and ones to watch.\u201d\n\nWith support from people like the Weil family, Florence M\u00fcller, designers who call Denver home and so many others, Denver\u2019s fashion identity continues to evolve, much like the city itself. Denver fashion was created out of utility and practicality and while it maintains these roots, it has started to flourish, thanks to the opportunities coming to our city. \u201cI think events like DFW and the fashion exhibits at the Denver Art Museum have really helped to bring attention to the fashion industry, both on a local and international level\u201d said fashion stylist, editor and Denver native, Georgia Alexia Benjou, who is also working to grow the industry here, launching a brand new concept with business partner, Kristin Priou, called Short Story.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s important to mention the increase in new residents from all over the country (and beyond) that contribute their own unique style to our city. Price explained that Denver fashion \u201cfeels like Denver itself. The pioneer spirit comes through. We aren\u2019t trying to be anything other than ourselves: unpretentious, confident and free in spirit.\u201d\n\nAs we reflect back on Denver\u2019s identity, it\u2019s important to look back on the people and events that have led us to this point and contributed to our modern identity. Denver\u2019s pioneer spirit can still be seen in the evolution of Western wear, the growing authority of DFW, the local designers who started it all and the fledgling designers who made a new home here. Denver\u2019s fashion identity is a unique blend of elements that could only happen right here, right now. Functionality, utility and plenty of self-expression, not to mention international influence and a spotlight on local art, blend to create the soul of Denver fashion.", "title": "How Denver Developed Its Fashion Identity", "dataset": "['manual_google_by_location']", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Denver']"}, {"id": 8867, "city": null, "url": "https://denver.cbslocal.com/2020/12/04/denver-public-schools-sexual-assault-rape-culture/", "text": "DENVER (CBS4)\u2013 Some high schoolers in Denver Public Schools are starting to make progress in their campaign for drastic changes to the sex education curriculum. This, after they claim to have been sexually assaulted by fellow students, some even during school hours on school campus.\n\nFollowing meetings with students concerned about a rape culture in the school system, Thomas Jefferson High School Principal Mike Christoff has implemented several changes.\n\n\u201cFor us, it\u2019s addressing what are the concerns from the kids, listening to them, listening to their conversations, educating them on what consent is, and moving forward,\u201d Christoff said.\n\nDespite challenges of the pandemic, Christoff has added voluntary lectures to the students\u2019 advisement classes, which are daily 30 minute virtual social/emotional learning classes. Some guest lecturers so far have been experts from the Denver District Attorney\u2019s Office and Denver Health, as well as a school social worker.\n\nChristoff also says the school has partnered with a student group from the University of Denver to create a female empowerment group called Project Like A Girl.\n\nThis week, the school news broadcast also made an announcement about a youth leadership project called Let\u2019s Get Real.\n\n\u201cThe goal for Let\u2019s Get Real is to support youth leaders who will in turn promote healthy relationships and a culture of consent. These leaders will determine project activities which can involve designing social media campaigns, writing letters to editors, and testifying at the capitol on any legislation affecting youth and the issues related to abuse and violence,\u201d the announcement reads.\n\nThe push for change has been therapeutic for some students, like Fania Swadener, a senior at Thomas Jefferson High School, who met with Christoff in September about making the changes.\n\n\u201cBy working on this movement, and by helping and talking to other girls who have been through so many of these experiences, I feel way, way, way safer about my story and my mindset,\u201d said Swadener.\n\nShe says she was sexually assaulted by a popular boy in school in March 2019. She says the boy forced himself on her underneath a staircase on campus during school hours.\n\n\u201cIt was like I had to say no, until I had to say yes,\u201d said Swadener.\n\nShe said just two hours after it happened, she reported the assault to school administrators. She says a school resource officer interviewed her without first calling her parents.\n\n\u201cOnce I was talking to the school about it, I ultimately said,\u2019 I don\u2019t want to report, I don\u2019t want to go any further with this,\u2019 because the reactions of the administration and even the other kids that I had told about it were already negative, were already questioning my experience,\u201d Swadener said. \u201cIt was just immediately being questioned, being asked what I thought of it as, and you know, I was crying, I was in shock.\u201d\n\nShe says nothing happened to the boy.\n\n\u201cI had two classes with this person, every single day, I think I failed out of both of them,\u201d Swadener said. \u201cIt was a complete violation of my rights, my privacy, my permission, and I think for me, it took a very long time to even feel comfortable going to school.\u201d\n\nSchool administrators were unable to comment about the allegations due to privacy laws, but said they follow strict policies to report allegations to police and provide support measures for students.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a process that we have to follow, and so all of those things are documented, and we have to work with Denver police,\u201d Christoff said.\n\nAsked if sexual assaults on campus were common, Christoff said, \u201cI\u2019d say no, it\u2019s not a common thing that we deal with, allegations are made, it happens, unfortunately it does happen in high school.\u201d\n\nSince then, Fania has been sharing her experience with other high schoolers in DPS, learning she\u2019s not alone.\n\nThis summer, dozens of allegations spread across social media about several sex assaults of East High School students by several classmates. Those allegations prompted more than 100 students to protest in front of the school, calling for better sex and consent education training, and for the boys who are accused to be banned from school activities until an investigation is complete.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s so frightening, that coming in as a freshman, you\u2019re taught consent, but you\u2019re taught it in a way that you\u2019re able to laugh at it, and I don\u2019t think consent should be laughed at. It\u2019s something that shouldn\u2019t be overwhelming, it should just be a clear and simple yes,\u201d said East High School sophomore Lillian Jordan, who also serves on student council.\n\nAlso speaking at those protests was DSST Byers senior Valerie Boutwell. She says she too was sexually assaulted by a classmate, who allegedly raped several other girls in her class.\n\n\u201cFor us, the policies at our school that had been put in place around that were helping the perpetrator more than they were helping the survivor, and so we all felt like we were being attacked and we were being blamed rather than the school was trying to help us,\u201d Boutwell said.\n\nShe said there are no counselors at her school for survivors to turn to.\n\n\u201cWe could go to our deans or we could go to our college counselors, and for survivors, that\u2019s often times really scary, because you don\u2019t want to be telling the person who is going to be writing your letter of recommendation for college about this experience you had, because they might have a bias,\u201d Boutwell said.\n\nDSST Byers Director Elin Curry says the school has been working to provide better resources to students.\n\n\u201cOne of the ways we\u2019ve committed to that over the last five years is to reallocate some of our funding towards a bigger mental health team, and we do have a larger mental health team on our campus than most other schools in DPS, so we\u2019ve got three full-time social workers that work with us to address student needs, and also a team that\u2019s working really hard to make sure we have pipelines outside of school resources for students who do need ongoing counseling and support,\u201d Curry said.\n\nWhile there have been some positive steps, Boutwell, Swadener, and Jordan feel that more could be done. They would like the school system to implement mandatory consent education classes all four years of high school.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just say that okay, now that something\u2019s happened now it\u2019s over, because there\u2019s still a lot of problems, there\u2019s still a lot of things that DPS, administration, and teachers don\u2019t know how to address,\u201d Swadener said.\n\nDenver Public Schools sent a written statement that reads:\n\n\u201cWe understand the importance of creating a culture of consent and helping to prevent sexual misconduct. We know that this is a big concern to many of our students. We hear them, and we agree. DPS has developed comprehensive curriculum on health education that includes education on consent. Currently, schools are not required to offer health, and each school determines the classes they offer outside required classes. We know that many of our schools are doing amazing work in this space. We are working on strategies to include comprehensive health educational programs across K-12 grades in all schools so that all students receive the knowledge and skills they need to make healthy decisions.\n\nAs educators, one of our goals is to nurture the whole student. All of our students deserve to feel safe and secure in their bodies. When a student comes forward with a concern related to inappropriate sexual contact, either harassment or assault, we focus on identifying what actions and services are needed for each student. We also work with law enforcement to address any legal issues that may arise in specific cases of alleged misconduct. Additionally, we are engaged in ensuring that our educators are trained on sexual misconduct, consent, dating violence, and reporting obligations under Title IX. This includes assuring that everyone involved, including students accused of misconduct, will be treated fairly and receive due process.\u201d", "title": "Students In Denver Public Schools Working With Administrators To Eradicate \u2018Rape Culture\u2019", "dataset": "['manual_google_by_location']", "labels": "['rape', 'crime']", "annot_city": "['Denver']"}, {"id": 8868, "city": null, "url": "https://www.denverpost.com/2020/12/03/denver-homeless-community-church-uptown/", "text": "Denver\u2019s second sanctioned homeless encampment will be in the parking lot of a church in the Uptown neighborhood.\n\nThe city\u2019s Community Planning and Development Department said Thursday that it has issued a temporary zoning permit for an encampment at Denver Community Church, 1543 and 1595 N.

Transportation, shelter and job counseling for families with children will cost nearly $200,000 per year, according to the news release.\n\nThe city of Riverside CARES grant program awarded the group $18,000 to help them launch.\n\nMuch of the organizing for Family Promise of Riverside is centered at Riverside\u2019s Magnolia Presbyterian Church, which has hosted community meetings and has donated materials and funds.\n\nFunds raised will help finance repairs and renovation to a house behind Riverside City College that Family Promise will use as a day center for families who are looking for jobs or need a place to be during the day. Funds will also pay for an executive director with a social work background and for a 15-passenger van that will ferry children to school or parents to work as they get on their feet and find a home, according to the news release.\n\nFor Deanna Cohen, launching Family Promise of Riverside is a family affair. Her husband, Aaron, a real estate agent, is also a board member and their children Kierstyn, 15, Caitlyn, 12, and Parker, 5, are involved in the effort.\n\nKierstyn is chairman of the communication team and Caitlyn has dropped off hundreds of flyers at houses of worship in Riverside. The Cohen children have also helped their mother as she organized volunteers to create flyers, brochures, a website, presentations at church events and a fundraiser that put concrete Raincross statues in people\u2019s gardens.\n\n\u201cWe really wanted something we could do as a family, not just sending money, somewhere that allowed our children to build relationships and understand that we are all more alike than different,\u201d Deanna Cohen said in the news release. \u201cOur kids realize that they can make a difference despite their age.

Both men have pleaded not guilty.\n\n'Intent to bribe...'\n\nElliot Peters, Wessman's defense attorney, initially established his argument to persuade Hopp to dismiss the charges against Wessman late last year.\n\nPeters outlined in a 2019 court filing that the prosecution's case connecting payments made by Wessman to Meaney and then to Pougnet is built on \"inadmissible evidence\" and \"irrelevant information.\"\n\n\"No direct evidence connected Wessman to payments to Pougnet,\" Peters wrote.\n\nSimilarly, Peters argued in court on Friday that the prosecution's claim that a series of emails, in which Pougnet purportedly requested consulting work to supplement his pay as mayor, do not directly incriminate Wessman.\n\nThe scheme, that Wessman paid Meaney to pay Pougnet, is built on speculation, Peters argued, and does not establish the probable cause necessary for the charges against his client to be sustained.\n\nIn short, Peters argued, the prosecution failed to \"clearly show an intent to bribe.\"\n\nHopp was persuaded, in part, by Peters' extensive reference to a case from the 1940s, in which a store owner and his two children were indicted on conspiracy to bribe the city manager of Sacramento.\n\nIn that case, siblings James Dong and Rose Chang delivered to the home of City Manager Bartley Cavanaugh a carton of liquor and an envelope containing cash, a business card and a letter bearing their father's name, Dong Haw.\n\nThe letter was written by the daughter and indicated that the money was a gift for the city manager's vacation and that more gifts would come.\n\nDong Haw's attorney later successfully argued to have the charges against him dismissed, in part, because Dong Haw's children wrote the letter and made the delivery.\n\nPeters similarly argued in his filing that Wessman is not directly or explicitly linked to the payments allegedly made by Meaney to Pougnet.\n\n\"During the time in question, Wessman Development was involved in numerous real estate projects and the downtown project was just one of them,\" Peters wrote. \"Did Wessman sign a stack of checks that were given to him by subordinates? Did he ask what every check was for? Did he find out what every recipient did after they deposited each check?\"\n\nIn addition to questioning Wessman's involvement in the alleged scheme, Peters also highlighted that the city of Palm Springs was so eager for Wessman's company to complete the downtown project that there was no need for a bribe to take place.\n\n\"This downtown project, which is now completed and a smashing success, was wanted by the city,\" Peters said Friday.\n\nWhile Peters persuaded Hopp that the evidence presented by the prosecution to the grand jury did not amount to probable cause for Wessman to proceed to trial, the other defendants weren't as fortunate.\n\nHopp denied similar motions argued by attorneys for Pougnet and Meaney, clearing the path for the two to proceed to trial.\n\nIf convicted as charged, Pougnet could face more than 19 years in prison, while Meaney could face 12 years behind bars. Pougnet would also be barred from ever holding public office again.\n\nWhen asked if he believed his office established probable cause against all three defendants, Hestrin said, \"Absolutely.\n\n\"Respectfully,\" he added, \"I think Judge Hopp got this wrong.\"\n\nMeanwhile, downtown...\n\nSeveral Palm Springs current city council members and City Manager David Ready deferred to City Attorney Jeffrey Ballinger to provide comment regarding the dismissal of Wessman's charges.\n\n\"The city is waiting to review the judge\u2019s ruling, in order to determine the judge\u2019s rationale for the dismissal,\" Ballinger wrote in an email Friday evening.\n\nUnprompted, Ballinger then added that Palm Springs taxpayers benefitted from last year's settlement with Wessman's former company, which is now called Grit Development.\n\n\"Fortunately for the city and its taxpayers, the city resolved its civil case against Wessman\u2019s company last year, resulting in over $40 million worth of real property being transferred to the city, for the benefit of those taxpayers,\" Ballinger said.\n\nBecause of the criminal charges against Pougnet, Palm Springs could have pursued Government Code Section 1090 claims against Grit Development.\n\nSection 1090 bars government officials from holding a financial interest in contracts made in their official capacity.\n\nAs a result, underlying contracts linked to wrongdoing by the former mayor, should he be convicted, would become void. That meant the city could have tried to take back up to $33 million connected to the downtown revitalization project, which Wessman's company was conducting.\n\nIn 2017, after the announcement of criminal charges, Wessman retired from his role at Wessman Development, ending his involvement with the downtown project. His company was subsequently renamed Grit Development and his son-in-law, Michael Braun, took over as one of the leaders of the company.\n\nIn July 2019, Palm Springs City Council unanimously approved a settlement with Grit in which the development firm gave Palm Springs five parcels of land equaling about 120 acres, valued at nearly $37 million.\n\nIn return, according to the settlement, should Pougnet be convicted, Palm Springs agreed to forfeit its right to recoup the $33 million from Grit.\n\nThe case against the former mayor...\n\nProsecutors allege Pougnet pocketed a total of $375,000 between 2012 and 2014 to vote favorably on certain development projects when they came before the Palm Springs City Council.\n\nPayments to Pougnet were allegedly drawn directly from accounts maintained by Meaney's Union Abbey Co. and Wessman Development and additional individuals linked to the developers.\n\nIn March, Hopp unsealed more than 700 pages of grand jury transcripts in the case, which revealed several new aspects of the case.\n\nProsecutors told the grand jury that Pougnet planned to move to Colorado to join his husband and two children when his first term ended in 2011, but the two developers allegedly put him \"on their payroll'' in order to secure his votes on their projects.\n\nPreviously, defense attorneys for the trio sought to have the transcripts, which include testimony from 13 witnesses, sealed until the end of the trial. They argued that reporting on the material might taint the defendants' chances of getting a fair trial.\n\n\"This is a case about political corruption in the city of Palm Springs,'' Riverside County Deputy District Attorney Amy Barajas told 19 grand jurors in August 2019. \"What kind of corruption? Well, one of the oldest stories in the book. Some wealthy real estate developers get a politician on their payroll, and in exchange they get favorable treatment, inside access and large contracts.''\n\nAccording to the prosecutor, Pougnet was hesitant about remaining in Palm Springs and seeking another term as mayor. Barajas presented to the grand jury an email exchange from May 30, 2011, between Meaney and Pougnet, in which Meaney wrote, \"Everything is in place. The big question from everyone ... is what are your plans?''\n\nPougnet's response to the question appeared to indicate their relationship hinged on Pougnet securing a legitimate, by-the-book job.\n\nThe two would later agree to a sum of $225,000, according to an email read aloud by Barajas as she questioned FBI Special Agent Doris H. Webster in front of the grand jury.\n\nOn Friday, former Palm Springs Mayor Rob Moon, who ran for office in the wake of the 2015 FBI raid on Palm Springs City Hall \u2014 part of the agency's probe into corruption allegations \u2014 said that while he is not aware of the details that led Hopp to drop the charges against Wessman, he believes Pougnet should be held to a higher standard.\n\n\"Steve is unique in the group of defendants in that he was elected into a position of public trust,\" Moon said.\n\nHestrin echoed Moon's statement when discussing his office's resolve to appeal to reinstate the charges against Wessman.\n\n\u201cElected officials are held to a higher standard and they have the people\u2019s trust,\" Hestrin said. \"They are required to take precautions to safeguard the people's trust, which the average citizen doesn\u2019t have to do.\"\n\nCity News Service contributed to this report.", "title": "Riverside County DA says prosecution will appeal dismissal of bribery, corruption charges against developer Wessman", "dataset": "['manual_google_by_location']", "labels": "['crime', 'not_sure']", "annot_city": "['Riverside']"}, {"id": 8877, "city": null, "url": "https://www.pe.com/2020/12/02/riverside-city-council-affirms-ethics-violations-by-councilwoman-gaby-plascencia/", "text": "For the first time, the Riverside City Council has confirmed a finding that a city official \u2014 Councilwoman Gaby Plascencia \u2014 has violated city ethics rules.\n\nOn Tuesday night, Dec. 1, the council voted 5-1 and 6-0 to adopt two recent violations found by the city Board of Ethics.

At the time, Plascencia said only 25% of members of city panels were people of color, and she intended to ask others to resign in order to \u201cchange the face of our boards and commissions.\u201d She abandoned the attempt.\n\nRiverside resident Roberta Allotta brought the complaint against Plascencia.\n\n\u201cApparently, it is Councilwoman Plascencia\u2019s mission to fix this problem of too many white men in government,\u201d Allotta testified at the Board of Ethics\u2019 Oct. 15 hearing on the matter.\n\nOn Tuesday, the council voted 5-1, with Councilman Andy Melendrez casting the no vote, to adopt the finding that Plascencia used her position for personal gain, and 6-0 to adopt the finding of discrimination.\n\nCity Clerk Colleen Nicol said the decisions marked the first time since Riverside\u2019s ethics panel began hearings in 2009 that the City Council has adopted board findings of violations. The board is charged with overseeing the conduct of council members, mayors, and members of city boards and commissions.\n\nDuring the October hearing, Plascencia said, \u201cI\u2019ve shown there has been no personal gain. I am continuing to be committed to all constituents in Riverside.\u201d\n\nPlascencia said her intent was \u201cnever to be divisive.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd I\u2019m hoping that we can put this behind us and we can move on to really do good things for all of Riverside,\u201d she said, according to the hearing transcript.\n\nThe council postponed deciding whether Plascencia should be punished, opting to wait to see what comes of a new hearing on the complaint that was sent back.\n\nMayor Rusty Bailey said sanction options include a public apology, sensitivity training, removal from regional committees, removal from the mayor pro tem rotation, restriction on travel to conferences and public censure.\n\nThe council\u2019s adoption doesn\u2019t mean all the members agreed with the board\u2019s conclusions.\n\nCouncilwoman Erin Edwards said she disagreed with the discrimination finding and called it \u201ca much more complex issue than what we have before us.\u201d\n\nEdwards said she would have reached a different conclusion had she been asked to judge the merits of the discrimination complaint.\n\n\u201cThat is not the decision that we are being asked to make here tonight,\u201d she said.\n\nUnder the city\u2019s procedure for handling ethics matters, the council must adopt findings unless it finds the ethics board made a \u201cclear error\u201d or abused its discretion. The council in October tossed out other complaints against Plascencia on that basis.\n\nCouncilman Ronaldo Fierro voiced similar frustration with the procedure.\n\n\u201cEven if we may have drawn a different conclusion ourselves in the exact same hearing with the exact same facts, all we can do at this point is find error with the end goal of rectifying the error,\u201d he said.\n\nFierro said the city\u2019s procedure is \u201cuncomfortable and confusing\u201d and something that may need to be changed.\n\nCouncilman Jim Perry said the council can discuss possible changes later this month.\n\n\u201cThis is a very narrow route or path that we\u2019re on and there are definitely some things that need to be reviewed,\u201d Perry said.\n\nNicol, the city clerk, said the council annually examines the ethics code near the end of the year, and this year\u2019s review is scheduled for Tuesday, Dec. 15.", "title": "Riverside City Council affirms ethics violations by Councilwoman Gaby Plascencia", "dataset": "['manual_google_by_location']", "labels": "['not_sure']", "annot_city": "['Riverside']"}, {"id": 8878, "city": null, "url": "https://mynewsla.com/crime/2020/12/04/pair-accused-in-deadly-shooting-at-riverside-hookah-bar-arraigned/", "text": "Share this article:\n\nTwo men accused of gunning down a customer at a Riverside hookah bar pleaded not guilty Friday to murder and other charges.\n\nDontay Dwayne Davis, 32, of Corona and Andrew Lewis Jones, 28, of San Jacinto are accused in the 2019 slaying of 27-year-old Derrick Carlisle near the intersection of University and Iowa avenues.\n\nAlong with first-degree murder, the men are charged with sentence-enhancing gun and great bodily injury allegations.\n\nThey were jointly arraigned before Riverside County Superior Court Judge Gail O\u2019Rane, who scheduled a felony settlement conference for Feb. 18 at the Riverside Hall of Justice.\n\nBoth are being held without bail \u2014 Davis at the Smith Correctional Facility in Banning, and Jones at the Byrd Detention Center in Murrieta.\n\nDavis was arrested in August after homicide detectives served a search warrant at his home on Homestead Road.\n\nU.S. Marshals tracked Jones to a residence in Scottsdale, Arizona, where he was taken into custody without incident on Sept. 12.

After seeing the way she would dance around the house to the oldies music her father would play, her parents enrolled her in classes.\n\n\u201cMy love for dance came from its ability to surpass even the greatest thought or set of words that I could declare in writing,\u201d said the 27-year-old Guerra, who has lived in Riverside all her life. \u201cDance makes me a better human, because it creates an uncanny sensitivity to yourself and the people around you.\u201d\n\nGuerra started studying dance at Riverside City College, where her first class was with Sofia Carreras, who would go on to have a tremendous influence on the young dancer.\n\n\u201cShe was so detailed in her teaching, every articulation of the hand was just as important as grandiosity of the limbs,\u201d said Guerra. \u201cAnd I still keep her combinations, corrections and teaching method close for when I\u2019m teaching my own classes.\u201d\n\nGuerra would go on to join Carreras\u2019s Intersect Dance Theatre in 2014. When asked about favorite performances, she said every show she ever did with Intersect was her favorite. But there was one performance with the company at ARC Pasadena that stands out because of the venue.\n\n\u201cMuch of Carreras\u2019s work is based in theater and storytelling, which often required more acting than dancing,\u201d said Guerra. \u201cSo the audience was right there. They can see everything. Nothing was hidden or falsified. And as a dancer it is such an honor to see your audience witness you at your most vulnerable self.\u201d\n\nShe also joined an improvisation-based collective called Counterpoint/Shift founded and directed by Sue Roginski, whom Guerra called one of her greatest mentors.\n\nIt was not until 2019 that Guerra began taking classes outside of Riverside.\n\n\u201cI would often take the train out to Los Angeles or Orange County as often as I could to get to a class,\u201d she said. \u201cI might spend three hours travelling for an hour and a half class, but I needed to build up my resume because I was not up to par with the dancers in my class. I used my limitations and insecurities to push me closer to my dream and ultimately the woman I want to be.\u201d\n\nBy the time 2020 began, Guerra was taking advanced classes every day. She also began to feel like she was keeping up.\n\n\u201cI wanted to dance professionally and I was going to do whatever it took to do that, even if it meant creating my own avenue for success,\u201d she said.\n\nGuerra just finished performing \u201cIt Will Be for the Stranger, the Fatherless and the Widow,\u201d a solo piece which premiered during Imani Ma\u2019at Taylor\u2019s \u201cHonoring of Thyself,\u201d an ode to the 2019 passing of Taylor\u2019s father. Guerra described the pieced as being driven by studies of sound, listening and silence. She has continued to develop the piece and is building toward having live musicians perform alongside her.\n\nHer newest piece, \u201cEcho la Culpa,\u201d premiered November 7 with Modcollective of New York.

(Chase Stevens/Las Vegas Review-Journal) @csstevensphoto\n\nKyle Harris, left and Delilah Mejia-Lopez (Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department)\n\nA mysterious burglary that victimized a witness in one of Las Vegas\u2019 most high-profile murder cases has been solved, police said.\n\nA Metropolitan Police Department investigation into the Aug. 7 burglary at the home of Yehuda Sharon, 66, of Las Vegas, culminated in the arrests and prosecutions last week of Kyle Harris, 27, and Delilah Mejia-Lopez, 20, both of Las Vegas.\n\nAuthorities said both have pleaded guilty to felony charges, admitting to breaking into Sharon\u2019s central Las Vegas home and stealing his belongings nearly a quarter-century after Sharon was a central witness in a murder case involving Margaret Rudin, who was suspected of killing her husband.\n\nSharon said he is \u201cvery pleased\u201d with the outcome of the robbery case.\n\n\u201cWhen you invite a friend to your house, you say, \u2018My house is your house,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cBut when you have enemies or burglars like these two, they look at it as if your house is my house. They think they can come in and do whatever they want to do.\u201d\n\nIntriguing background\n\nSharon is a former intelligence officer with the Israeli military. He was also a witness in one of the most high-profile murder cases in the Las Vegas Valley. Sharon was close friends with Rudin, whose millionaire husband, Ron Rudin, vanished seemingly without a trace in 1994. Margaret Rudin, police said, shot her husband as he slept in the couple\u2019s Las Vegas home, then burned his remains in an antique trunk at a cove near Lake Mohave.\n\nDubbed \u201cThe Black Widow\u201d in media accounts, Margaret Rudin fled Las Vegas while under law enforcement investigation. She was on the run until her apprehension in Massachusetts in 1999. She was convicted of murder by a Clark County jury and served nearly 20 years in prison before her release in January. Margaret Rudin denies involvement in her husband\u2019s killing.\n\nSharon, meanwhile, was in the middle of all of it. Police and prosecutors at the time of the murder case voiced suspicion that Sharon was Margaret Rudin\u2019s secret lover and that, perhaps, he had something to do with the disposal of Ron Rudin\u2019s body. In a September interview with the Las Vegas Review-Journal, Sharon said the two were just friends.\n\n\u201cI helped her with taxes,\u201d Sharon said.\n\nSharon was ultimately granted immunity by Clark County prosecutors in the Rudin case, but when he testified before a grand jury, he gave authorities no information of value in the prosecution. Sharon was never arrested or charged in the case.\n\nHe now calls the experience \u201cMy life as \u2018America\u2019s Most Wanted\u2019s\u2019 Secret Lover.\u201d Sharon makes his living these days selling a unique oil to churches.\n\nAugust burglary\n\nSharon said that in late July he traveled to California, then returned to find a break-in at his town home near Maryland Parkway and Russell Road. His Nissan pickup, his credit card, a cellphone and various other belongings were stolen. Las Vegas police responded, documented the burglary and took some fingerprints, Sharon said.\n\nHis stolen credit card was used twice at an area gas station after the burglary. A third attempted transaction was blocked by his credit card company.\n\nThe stolen vehicle was eventually recovered by police at Fashion Show mall, Sharon said, and it was packed with belongings from people he doesn\u2019t know. There were blankets, family photo albums, a FedEx receipt with a man\u2019s name and address on it, a bullet and a man\u2019s driver\u2019s license in the front seat. None of it was Sharon\u2019s, but when police released the truck to him, all of the belongings from other people were still in it.\n\nSharon soon became frustrated and questioned why it was taking so long to make an arrest. He also questioned why police didn\u2019t immediately process several clues left behind at the scene, and he voiced suspicions that police were dragging their feet because of his history in the Rudin case. Police said they were thoroughly investigating.\n\nStolen truck at Target\n\nLas Vegas police said last week that a stolen Toyota recovered in the parking lot of a Target store in the 9700 block of South Eastern Avenue on Nov. 3 helped crack the burglary case.\n\nPolice were called to the store because they saw a woman later identified as Mejia-Lopez breaking a window on the stolen vehicle. The vehicle had a fictitious license plate on it and two stolen license plates in the back seat. Police also found counterfeit money in the vehicle, according to arrest reports for Mejia-Lopez and Harris.\n\nPolice then obtained video surveillance showing Mejia-Lopez and Harris headed to a nearby apartment complex, where they were arrested. An officer handcuffed both, only to have both run from him with handcuffs still on. Harris was apprehended after a foot chase. Mejia-Lopez was found several minutes later by another officer in a Carl\u2019s Jr. parking lot.\n\n\u201cThe female had slipped my handcuffs during her escape, and was contacted without any cuffs on her,\u201d an officer wrote in an arrest report.\n\nOfficer Larry Hadfield said Thursday that detectives interviewed the pair and obtained a confession that led to charges against Harris and Mejia-Lopez in the Sharon burglary. Harris pleaded guilty Wednesday to attempted residential burglary, and Mejia-Lopez pleaded guilty Friday morning to a single count of felony residential burglary. She is scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 13.\n\nHarris has a long criminal history. He was on probation at the time Sharon\u2019s house was burglarized. His probation in a prior case was revoked this week, and he was sentenced to 19 to 48 months in prison, according to District Court records.\n\n\u201cThey should get the maximum,\u201d Sharon said Friday morning, adding he has talked to his neighbors about the arrest and that \u201cthe entire community is thankful.\u201d\n\nContact Glenn Puit by email at gpuit@reviewjournal.com.

We\u2019ve been kept apart from the people we care most about, and from incidental interactions that give life its spontaneity and spice. But we\u2019ve also been denied shared experiences: of going to a theater, or a gallery, or a concert, where you take in a performance or a piece of art with a group of people.\n\nTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor\n\nA lot of us have dealt with that absence by gathering outside by going on walks or going to the park. That\u2019s been nourishing, but for lovers of art, it also leaves something distinctly missing.\n\nPortland\u2019s Third New Angle Music usually programs a variety of forward-thinking live performances with a rotating cast of musicians, composers, dancers, authors and other artists.\n\nBut for these isolated pandemic times, they\u2019ve just begun a new program that bridges the gap between the live experiences we miss and the solo outdoors explorations possible today: it\u2019s a series of soundwalks. You pop in a pair of headphones and take a guided sonic tour through a local park, painstakingly mixed and guided by a local composer.\n\n\u201cWe wanted to do this to motivate people to go out into nature, but we also wanted to create a new listening experience for people,\u201d says Director Sarah Tiedemann, Artistic Director of Third Angle New Music.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so lonely and isolated right now, that this feels really intimate,\u201d she says. \u201cIt may look like you\u2019re walking alone but you have another person whispering in your ear as you\u2019re walking.\u201d\n\nPortland's Mt.

Listeners approach a staircase leading into Portland\u2019s Mt. Tabor Park as a soft voice introduces you to the experience you\u2019re about to undergo.\n\nYou walk through the park, yielding to your narrator\u2019s gentle directions as an ambient mix of field recordings and unseen narrators share impressions of the park. The recorded crunch of the trail and voices mix with your own footsteps, creating a hyper-real sonic environment that mirrors the space you are moving through.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really interested in playing around with the psychoacoustics experience,\u201d says Howard. \u201cWe came up with ways of helping the listener feel like they\u2019re surrounded and in a world. But then again, they\u2019re also really at that space where we did the recordings.\u201d\n\nThe experience is meditative, as you pay close attention to both your surroundings and the absent voices in your ears. It also feels, in a year where we\u2019ve spent so much time alone, unexpectedly communal.\n\nSound artist Branic Howard and writer Gabi Lewton-Leopold recording \"Overlay\" for the 3A Soundwalk Series Branic Howard\n\n\u201cThere were a few places I could sort of feel the people being around me, almost to the point of seeing them,\u201d says Tiedemann. \u201cIt was almost like having the group of people there in such a realistic, tangible way, it just felt like walking through echoes of a moment they had experienced: maybe even more so than if they had been there.\u201d\n\nThird Angle New Music will be releasing a new soundwalk, staged in a different Portland park, on the 15th of each month through August. The series will feature notable local composers like Yuan-Chen Li, Darrell Grant and Amenta Abioto. Each composer will structure their walk differently: some more historically focused, some more musical.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve just kind of given the composers free reign,\u201d says Tiedemann.\n\nTo experience Howard and Lewton-Leopold\u2019s Overlay yourself, go to Third Angle New Music\u2019s website where you can stream or download the audio yourself, as well as a map of the route it will take.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s all you need,\u201d Tiedemann says, \u201cand your earbuds and your own two feet.\u201d\n\nTo hear Tiedemann and Howard\u2019s full interview with OPB Weekend Edition host John Notarianni, use the audio player above.", "title": "Soundwalk series turns Portland\u2019s parks into audio art galleries", "dataset": "['manual_google_by_location']", "labels": "['public_space']", "annot_city": "['Portland']"}, {"id": 8891, "city": null, "url": "https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/2020/12/feds-link-portland-marijuana-farm-to-texas-college-drug-ring.html", "text": "A drug ring largely operated by current and former University of Texas students used apps and social media to sell counterfeit Adderall and Xanax often laced with fentanyl, the Department of Justice announced Friday.\n\nJustice officials said 13 people, including eight current and former students, have been charged with trafficking LSD, fentanyl and methamphetamine pills.\n\n\u201cWhat is particularly disturbing about this case is that what appeared to be extremely well-educated and talented people who had many opportunities in life to choose from, instead focused their business acumen and education in dealing illegal, dangerous and counterfeit drugs,\u201d U.S. Attorney Gregg Sofer said during a press conference.\n\nInvestigators said the defendants were taken into custody Thursday when searches resulted in the seizure of large quantities of fentanyl, LSD, marijuana, Adderall, Xanax and psilocybin, the hallucinogenic substance in magic mushrooms just blocks from the campus in Austin.

TriMet ridership numbers are in the tank and have shown no signs of recovery since the initial pandemic plummet. And transit\u2019s most high-powered champion, City Commissioner Chloe Eudaly, is in the waning weeks of her seat on council after losing her re-election bid last month.\n\nBut the Portland Bureau of Transportation is undeterred. The agency plans to launch an online open house for the Rose Lane Project next week (12/9) as a way to build momentum for the beleaguered mobility mode.\n\n\u201cCovid-19 has had a profound impact on the way we get around, including Portland\u2019s transit system,\u201d a PBOT statement released today said. \u201cThe Rose Lane Project, however, remains a priority for PBOT. It is a down payment on the future we want. As our city recovers from the Covid-19 pandemic and traffic increases, Rose Lane improvements will keep our most important transit lines running smoothly. This will help prevent the kinds of delays transit experienced by riders in the past.\u201d\n\nAt a meeting of the PBOT Freight Committee this morning, TriMet Senior Planner Jeff Owen explained current ridership is at a level similar to when Covid first hit. One reason is because the agency is encouraging people to stay off transit unless they\u2019re essential workers so there\u2019s more room (and less risk) for others. \u201cWe\u2019re ready to work on increasing ridership once vaccines are available,\u201d Owen added. He said federal Covid bailout funds have helped TriMet survive in recent months and hinted, \u201cThere could be some good news on the horizon from additional transit support from the federal level.\u201d\n\nThe vaccine and this additional funding \u2014 if both come through \u2014 could add even more urgency to PBOT\u2019s Rose Lane Project work.\n\nLaunched one year ago, the Rose Lane Project was created by Commissioner Eudaly\u2019s office to put into motion what PBOT envisioned with their Enhanced Transit Corridors plan. Several projects were completed in the first year including prefab bus islands on NW 18th and 19th, and a new bus lane on the Burnside Bridge, SW Madison, and NW Everett. While red, \u201cBus Only\u201d lanes get most of the attention, Rose Lane projects can include a variety of treatments that give bus, MAX and streetcar priority over other vehicles.\n\nWhile transit in Portland has lost Eudaly\u2019s seat on Council, it has gained Commissioner-Elect Mingus Mapps. In an interview last month he told me, \u201cI\u2019m a bus guy\u201d and that he has no plans to erase Eudaly\u2019s legacy.\n\nWhat remains unclear is how the big increase in work-from-homers and general changes in trip patterns might impact TriMet ridership in the long-term. Use of transit has been relatively flat in Portland in recent years and was on a slight downturn before the pandemic hit.\n\nAt their upcoming open house, PBOT says they\u2019ll share plans for several new projects they hope to build in 2021. Hopefully they\u2019ll also address the topic of how bike access integrates (or doesn\u2019t) with transit-focused changes to lanes and signals.\n\nWatch this space for the online open house and project reveals.

St. Mary\u2019s St.\n\nRestaurateur Lisa Wong received conceptual approval from a city commission on Wednesday to demolish most of the old El Mirador building on South St. Mary\u2019s Street so she can build a new home for Southtown staple Rosario\u2019s, which she has owned for 28 years.\n\n\u201cThis project is very important to me and being part of the neighborhood fabric is very important to me,\u201d Wong told the Historic and Design Review Commission (HDRC) just before the board unanimous approved the concept. The HDRC will have to grant the project final approval at a later date.\n\nOverseen by Wong and Douglas Architects, the reconstruction will replace the current one-story stucco structure\u2014a local landmark\u2014with a new 14,000-square-foot, two-story building, which will include a dining room, lounge, rooftop bar, an exterior elevator tower, and outdoor dining and seating areas. Most of the exterior will be clad in brick veneer, decorative metal screens and decorative glass, and a small portion in D\u2019Hanis brick.\n\nThe plan includes relocating the F.L. Dixon House, itself a local landmark and current home to Pig Liquors, to the eastern most part of the property, closer to the existing King William Garden House.\n\nclick to enlarge\n\nWong must submit a landmark designation request for an 1860s stone and caliche structure, part of which faces the parking lot, part of which El Mirador used as a dining room. The structure was originally the Jim Mitchel homestead and was expanded on over the years, \u201cincluding in the 1940s, when a stucco fa\u00e7ade and tower were added for Ward\u2019s New Confectionary and Drive Inn,\u201d the city\u2019s Office of Historic Preservation (OHP) wrote in the HDRC agenda packet.\n\n\u201cAt the time of renovation, a portion of the original interior of the caliche stone structure had been preserved,\u201d OHP wrote. \u201cThe building was further modified after the 1960s to include the front enclosed porch element and the removal of the 1940s tower element.\u201d\n\nThe El Mirador building on the property was designated a historic landmark in the 1980s because of the stone and caliche structure.\n\nHowever, the HDRC only has purview over building exteriors, and Wong plans to enclose the structure by extending the new restaurant footprint over the existing parking lot to neighboring Maverick Texas Brasserie. By designating only the caliche structure, the HDRC will have the ability to oversee it even when enclosed. Additionally, one of the stipulations requires the caliche structure to be used in a publicly accessible space inside the new restaurant in the final version of the project proposal.\n\nWong and Douglas Architects plan to deconstruct portions of the structure, and reincorporate them into the new building.\n\nDuring the meeting, Commissioner Jeffrey Fetzer said Wong should keep it as a dining space.\n\nThe stone and caliche room inside the former El Mirador restaurant.\n\nThe new design will double the size of the current restaurant, providing a more diverse dining experience to patrons, according to Wong. The conceptual plan includes a \u201cCOVID Consideration\u201d section that will create safer gathering spaces for patrons.\n\nBefore seeking approval from the HDRC, Wong and Andrew Douglas, architect and founder of Douglas Architects, worked closely with the Conservation Society of San Antonio, the Lavaca Neighborhood Association and the King William Neighborhood Association during the plan\u2019s development. All three groups expressed support for the redevelopment, while also calling for adjustments.\n\nMargaret Leeds, representing the King William Neighborhood Association, shared a letter from the association\u2019s architectural advisory committee, stating that its support was contingent on receiving an enforceable noise mitigation agreement to offset possible amplified noise levels within the neighborhood. Wong addressed these concerns during the presentation.\n\n\u201cYou have our commitment to continue to work on some of these design elements, as well as, I know there\u2019s some concerns on noise,\u201d Wong said during the presentation. \u201cAs I\u2019ve stated before, I\u2019m a restauranteur. I\u2019m running a restaurant, not an entertainment venue, so I know we can provide the correct language to give everyone the confidence that they can continue to enjoy the neighborhood.\u201d\n\nThe Conservation Society expressed both its support of build and concerns regarding the size of the proposed project, specifically the elevator tower.\n\n\u201cThe Conservation Society remains concerned that the massing of the new building includes a second story canopy and fence that are out of scale with the neighborhood,\u201d Patti Zaointz, the society\u2019s president, wrote in a statement read during the meeting.\n\nShe continued, \u201cThe Lavaca and King William neighborhoods, including commercial frontages, are defined by modest structures and a pedestrian-oriented rhythm of open spaces and building fronts. The long, continuous facade proposed here challenges the setback and massing pattern\u2014this could still be addressed by bearing the setback.\u201d\n\nDuring the meeting, Douglas agreed to reduce the visual impact of the proposed tower elevator.\n\nIn a letter written on behalf of the Lavaca Neighborhood Association, the organization echoed the Conservation Society\u2019s concerns and recommended the exclusion of fencing in the pedestrian right-of-way along the sidewalk.", "title": "Rosario\u2019s plan to demolish majority of San Antonio's El Mirador building receives first approval", "dataset": "['manual_google_by_location']", "labels": "['planning_&_design']", "annot_city": "['San Antonio']"}, {"id": 8897, "city": null, "url": "https://www.ksat.com/news/local/2020/12/05/man-arrested-after-firing-gunshots-into-whataburger-in-downtown-san-antonio/", "text": "SAN ANTONIO \u2013 A man was arrested after firing gunshots into a downtown Whataburger restaurant and throwing his weapon into the San Antonio River, San Antonio police said.\n\nNo injuries were reported in the shooting that occurred Friday night in the 400 block of East Commerce Street.\n\nPolice said they heard 10 gunshots in rapid succession in the area and saw the suspect, 18-year-old Pedro Ortega, running eastbound on East Commerce as pedestrians were yelling that he had a gun.\n\nFour downtown bike patrol officers went after Ortega and arrested him, but not before he was able to throw his handgun into the San Antonio River, according to police.\n\nThe shooting happened Friday night in downtown San Antonio, on E.

Integration occurred peacefully in San Antonio, and I\u2019m proud of it. And I think every San Antonian should be proud of it,\u201d Hardberger said.\n\nA 180-page architectural assessment report on the buildings by John G. Waite Associates of New York supports preservation of all three structures as part of a museum design.\n\nA 48-page report by Trinity University history Professor Carey Latimore on the civil rights movement in San Antonio from World War II to the mid-1960s describes a city struggling to evolve at the time of the peaceful integration, despite having a large military presence that helped open opportunities for Black people.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that stands out about how African Americans sought their civil rights in San Antonio is the fact that initially, the community seemed to strongly favor equal access rather than full integration,\u201d Latimore wrote.\n\nJoske\u2019s integrated later\n\nEven after seven downtown lunch counters peacefully desegregated March 16, 1960, Joske\u2019s did not integrate until that summer, Latimore noted in his report. San Antonio did not pass a nondiscrimination ordinance until 1965, falling \u201cbehind the tone of the nation.\u201d\n\nMembers of the Coalition for the Woolworth Building argue that the prominence of the lunch counter integration is partly borne through remarks by Jackie Robinson, the first Black baseball player in the major leagues. In comments that appeared widely in newspapers in 1960, he said, \u201cSan Antonians are setting examples for the whole nation.\u201d\n\nSarah Zenaida Gould, a coalition member and interim executive director of the Mexican American Civil Rights Institute in San Antonio, said the lunch counter desegregation also advanced access for Hispanics, Native Americans and members of one of the first Chinese American communities in Texas that had formed locally.\n\n\u201cSegregation was all about protecting the so-called boundaries of whiteness. If you were a light-skinned Mexican, you probably could enter into places like that. But if you were a dark-skinned Mexican, you could not,\u201d Gould said. \u201cThat struggle to integrate was a struggle fought by both African Americans and Mexican Americans.\u201d\n\nThe third report, a 26-page study by Alamo history researcher Kolby Lanham, provides archival images of the lunch counters that once existed in the Woolworth and Kress buildings, and it explores why one photo taken at the Kress, which had a linear, cafeteria-style lunch counter with tables in its basement, has at times been misidentified by researchers as the Woolworth counter. The photo was published in the San Antonio News in 1960 without attributing a specific site.\n\nA folder in the San Antonio Express-News archive at the University of Texas at San Antonio Libraries Special Collections contained one exterior photo of the Woolworth Building and eight interior images of the Kress lunch counter. The folder is labeled alternatively \u201cIntegration: African Americans at F.W. Woolworth lunch counter, 1960/03/16\u201d and \u201cRacial integration at a lunch counter in downtown San Antonio.\u201d\n\nOn ExpressNews.com: Historic events collide at site of Woolworth Building\n\nIn his report, Lanham theorized that a photographer initially went to both locations. But the folder lacked details on where all the photos were taken.\n\nAll three reports can be found at thealamo.org. Click on the \u201cConnect\u201d tab, then \u201cResearch & Studies.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Waite report, Woolworth\u2019s U-shaped lunch counter, also shown in photos in Lanham\u2019s report, was in the southwest corner of the building\u2019s first floor. A 1937 ad in the San Antonio Light announced a grand reopening of the building with a \u201cnew modern sanitary lunch department.\u201d The report said the counter likely was remodeled in the 1950s with a red-and-gray color scheme.\n\nThe building now houses two amusement attractions but still has evidence of the lunch counter, including a red-tiled section marking the serving area and round holes in the floor where stools had been bolted, the report states.\n\nBecause of its location in the national Alamo Historic District, the structure is one of 10 Woolworth buildings listed individually or as part of a district in the National Register of Historic Places. It is the second-oldest among the 10. One in Nashville, Tenn., built in 1913, is the oldest. Another built in 1926 in Fort Worth is similar to the one in San Antonio.\n\nStill waiting\n\nA public-private Alamo project to build the museum and renovate the plaza has been in limbo since the Texas Historical Commission voted 12-2 against relocation of the 1930s Cenotaph in September. Since then, five key nonprofit board members or fundraisers have resigned.\n\nThe city continues to study options for altering a lease with the Texas General Land Office to run part of the plaza as an outdoor interpretive space. It\u2019s also likely there will be state legislation proposed that, if passed next year, could affect the project, including an effort to place the Alamo in the custodianship of the historical commission, rather than the Land Office.\n\nCity Councilman Roberto Trevi\u00f1o, who leads the six-member Alamo Management Committee guiding the project, has said the group is \u201cstill talking about the plaza\u201d while \u201ctrying to map out\u201d a way for the project to move forward.\n\nAlamo Trust Chairman Welcome Wilson Jr. has said the reports \u201cdemonstrate our commitment to complete and accurate research\u201d and will be used to \u201cinform the community, our Alamo partners and others as we develop a world-class museum and visitor center that will honor the sacrifice that the brave Alamo defenders made in 1836.\u201d\n\nOfficials have said museum architects have done only preliminary design work. The Conservation Society of San Antonio, which has fought to protect the Woolworth Building, said the Waite report provides strong rationale for preserving all three structures.\n\n\u201cWe would love to see a commitment from the Alamo to retain the buildings,\u201d Conservation Society President Patti Zaiontz said.\n\nOn ExpressNews.com: Global advocate supports preserving Woolworth Building\n\nFor Dream Week, the society plans to hold a webinar Jan. 20 highlighting historic sites tied to people of color, including the Alazan Courts, which are threatened with demolition, and the recently discovered circa-1870s foundation of an early St. James African Methodist Episcopal Church by San Pedro Creek.\n\nThere are plans to restore the lunch counter at the Kress Building, at 311 E. Houston St., a couple of blocks west of Alamo Plaza, as part of a civil rights institute connected with Trinity University. But that project is on hold amid the economic slowdown of the pandemic.\n\nThe conservation society has developed an evolving position paper arguing that the story of the 1960 lunch counter integration should be told at both locations.\n\nGould agrees, saying the struggle for civil rights and equality, which continues today, should not be oversimplified. She believes having it represented at the Alamo, a culturally \u201ccontested site,\u201d would provide context to \u201cour different understandings of what that space means.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis can be a wonderful opportunity to tell a long history of working toward freedom, independence, equality,\u201d she said. \u201cFor all those people for whom the Alamo is a symbol of freedom, we need to remember that it wasn\u2019t freedom for everybody. That lunch counter story is a continuation of this thread of humankind working toward freedom and equality.\u201d\n\nScott Huddleston covers Bexar County government and the Alamo for the San Antonio Express-News.

He posed the question, \u201cWhat\u2019s the most obscure big city in America?\u201d Had it been a joke, the punchline would have been \u201cAnd why did you pick San Jose?\u201d\n\nShockingly, the Twitterverse did not rise up as one and proclaim San Jose as the unanimous selection. People made arguments for Jacksonville, Charlotte, San Antonio and even San Diego as places that live in the shadows much more than the Capital of Silicon Valley. (And no, I don\u2019t mean Palo Alto, smart aleck.)\n\nDon\u2019t they remember when stat-nerd site FiveThirtyEight crunched some numbers and declared San Jose the Most Forgettable Major American City in 2016? If you take our obscurity from us, what will we have left? But San Jose\u2019s reign as the Rodney Dangerfield of cities was seriously challenged by people who didn\u2019t even know we\u2019re the 10th most populous city in the U.S.\n\n\u201cFrom a popular culture standpoint, Houston,\u201d wrote user Mark R. Yzaguirre. \u201cHuge city, but can you name many recent movies or TV shows that depict it?\u201d The lack of pop culture settings was almost mentioned as a reason for Phoenix\u2019s potential obscurity. And just five years ago, that would have covered San Jose, too. But now, it\u2019s the setting of ABC\u2019s \u201cThe Good Doctor\u201d and Mayor Sam Liccardo showed up briefly on HBO\u2019s \u201cSilicon Valley.\u201d But wait \u2014 unlike San Jose, both Phoenix and Houston have teams in the NFL, MLB, and NBA. They\u2019re depicted on a little TV show called \u201cMonday Night Football.\u201d\n\nIndianapolis was described by one respondent as a \u201ctotal mystery\u201d but c\u2019mon, it\u2019s a state capital and it hosts one of the world\u2019s most famous auto races. How much more do you need to know? San Jose, on the other hand, has an actual \u201cmystery house\u201d as its primary tourist attraction. Of course, we also have the San Jose Sharks and everybody\u2019s new best friend, Zoom, is headquartered in downtown San Jose. (Zoom being based in San Jose is a point against obscurity; nobody knowing that fact is a point for. The mind boggles.)\n\nThen you had a group arguing that the Inland Empire \u2014 the giant suburban mess that swirls around Riverside \u2014 deserved the dubious honor. As many, many people pointed out, the Inland Empire\u2019s not a city, but the nickname of an MSA (Metropolitan Statistical Area, if you don\u2019t speak planner). Still, the Southern California region had a legion of fans passionately defending the notion that nobody gave a damn about them.\n\nJosh Kammerer argued for El Paso, as it\u2019s \u201c500 miles from anywhere.\u201d Then without taking a digital breath, he threw in, \u201cYou San Jose people have major league sports and are part of \u2018The Bay Area\u2019 and \u2018Silicon Valley.\u2019 Get off it.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019d love to, but Chloe Meyere, who spent three years on the City of San Jose\u2019s communications team, can attest that not everyone got that memo. In her Twitter response, she said reporters from outside the area would ask her, \u201cHow far are you from L.A. proper?\u201d and \u201cCosta Rica?\u201d In my profession\u2019s defense, nobody goes into journalism because of their strong map skills.\n\nGray, the thread\u2019s originator, said all the \u201ccorrect\u201d answers \u2014 Charlotte, Columbus, Jacksonville, Fort Worth \u2014 were undergoing big population booms and would probably not be obscure in 25 years. But even he said, \u201cSan Jose is absolutely obscure.

The project is tied to a national group called the Levitt Foundation, which has a track record for bringing similar venues to communities throughout the country.\n\nBrian Grayson, a preservationist who serves on the board of Friends of Levitt Pavilion-San Jose, put in perspective the plaintiffs\u2019s claim about the facility\u2019s potential impacts. Though the city\u2019s environmental impact report\u2014called an EIR\u2014evaluated the prospect of hundreds of concerts with thousands of attendees, it\u2019s unlikely that many people would end up going.\n\nUnder the plan approved by the city, the Levitt foundation would have an obligation to host 50 free family-friendly concerts a year before charging anyone to attend an event.\n\n\u201cThe EIR\u2019s job is to examine the max case situation,\u201d Grayson explained in an interview with San Jose Inside. \u201cThe chances of 5,000 people ever happening (at a single event) is very slim. That number was the max given if every activity was going on at the park at once, not just at the pavilion. As for 300 concerts a year? We\u2019re just trying to get to 50.\u201d\n\nGrayson sees the pavilion as a boon for San Jose\u2019s urban core and hopes issues can be resolved to prevent any significant impacts that would threaten St. James district\u2019s historic status. He also understands how a project of this magnitude can elicit strong feelings on both sides.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re certainly within their rights to do this,\u201d he said. \u201cIdeally, it would be great if these things could be solved without litigation, but I understand sometimes this is where it has to go.

The foundation also filed an appeal of the city\u2019s authorization of a historic preservation permit for the project, which the San Jose City Council will discuss at its meeting on Tuesday.\n\nThe foundation focuses on the preservation of the 1893 St. Claire Club building, which sits on the northern edge of St. James Park and serves as home to the second-oldest men\u2019s social club in the state. And, in its lawsuit, the group argues that the pavilion would alter the park to such an extent that it would jeopardize the historic landmark designations on its 127-year old building and that of the St. James Square National Register Historic District, which includes the park and eight other buildings in the surrounding area.\n\nThe foundation\u2019s leaders say they support the city\u2019s efforts to revitalize the shabby park but not the addition of a \u201cproblematic\u201d performing arts and music pavilion.\n\n\u201cWe simply ask the Court to enforce clear requirements of CEQA and the city\u2019s own ordinances that protect the historical integrity of St. James Park and the historic district,\u201d the foundation\u2019s executive director Shawn Atkisson said in a statement. \u201cThe park project should proceed, and our legal action will not prevent it when revised to relocate the Levitt Pavilion to a compatible site without significant environmental impacts.\u201d\n\nSt. James Park, which was constructed in the 1800s, was originally envisioned to serve as a flourishing haven and public square for residents of San Jose. But over the decades, the 7.5-acre park has deteriorated and became afflicted with crime, blight and homelessness.\n\nThe redesign vision of St. James park features a new playground, dog parks, a cafe and an outdoor pavilion that could accommodate 50 to 300 events annually like film festivals, concerts and dance and theater performances. The plans envision that the largest events at the park could accommodate up to 5,000 attendees.\n\nAn environmental impact report released earlier this summer found that the proposed plans would cause \u201csignificant and unavoidable\u201d impacts on the historic character of the park as well as an increase in noise for the surrounding community members. To reduce the amount of noise caused by events at the pavilion, the report proposed ending all events at 10 p.m. and offered alternatives such as building an enclosed pavilion or placing the proposed pavilion in Discovery Meadow at the southern end of the Guadalupe River Park instead.\n\nDespite the impacts related to noise and the historic character of the area, the city council approved the plans and opted against pursuing the proposed alternatives.\n\nIn the lawsuit, the foundation argues that the city violated its Historic Preservation Ordinance, which prohibits approval of a project that is \u201cdetrimental to a historic district or to a structure,\u201d and that it failed to comply with state regulations when rejecting the alternative Discovery Meadow location for the pavilion without a legal basis.\n\nSan Jose City Attorney Nora Frimann on Friday said she had not yet seen the lawsuit but that the city \u201cbelieves that the environmental review was proper.\u201d\n\nAbout five years ago, the Mortimer & Mimi Levitt Foundation \u2014 a national nonprofit organization that has helped transform dilapidated parks across the country \u2014 approached San Jose about interest in building one of its outdoor performing venues in San Jose to hold 50 free concerts for the community each year. Under the program, the foundation pledged to put $500,000 toward building a \u201cLevitt Pavilion\u201d in an urban park in need of revitalization and San Jose was required to assemble a nonprofit board to raise funds to pay for the live entertainment once the project was constructed.\n\nBrian Grayson, a board member on the Friends of Levitt Pavilion-San Jose and a former executive director of the San Jose Preservation Action Council, said if the pavilion was moved to Discovery Meadow, years of planning and crusading by his group would all be for naught.\n\n\u201c(The foundation) looks for spaces that have fallen into disrepair or on hard times but that have potential,\u201d Grayson said in an interview Friday. \u201cIf the city were to relocate (the pavilion) to Discovery Meadow, it most likely would not be a Levitt project, because that area wouldn\u2019t fall into that sort of designation.\u201d\n\nGrayson said he\u2019s holding out hope that the city and the Sainte Claire Historic Preservation Foundation can come out of this with something that appeases everyone, even if it requires litigation.\n\n\u201cGiven the history here, it\u2019s understandable that folks would have some concerns, but we hope that they can be resolved,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2026Based on the information we have at this point, I think the historic resources can be protected and a project like the pavilion can still co-exist with that.\u201d\n\nDespite the foundation\u2019s worries over the impacts of the park\u2019s redesign, building a pavilion of the scope envisioned is still merely a grandiose dream. The city has only secured $7 million \u2014 or less than 15% \u2014 of the project\u2019s whopping estimated price tag of $59.1 million and has yet to determine a funding source for the remaining costs.", "title": "Preservationist group seeks to block plans for performing arts venue in St. James Park", "dataset": "['manual_google_by_location']", "labels": "['public_space']", "annot_city": "['San Jose']"}, {"id": 8907, "city": null, "url": "https://abc7news.com/san-jose-tree-rental-our-city-forest-sj-holiday-rent-ca-reforest-trees/8504975/", "text": "EMBED >More News Videos A Bay Area Christmas tree farm owner says people seem to be buying trees earlier than normal this year to bring some normalcy in their lives.\n\nSAN JOSE, Calif. (KGO) -- The holiday rent-a-tree program run by Our City Forest Nursery and Training Center in San Jose is back this December, with hundreds of potted trees to be offered up for winter festivities.The trees come in tall, short, traditional and non-traditional options for customers, and Our City Forest wants residents to open their homes for the holidays for these unique, leafy visitors.The holiday rent-a-tree program is in its sixth year of operation, working towards the goal of getting residents to rent a potted tree to decorate for the holidays instead of chopping one down just to discard it a month from now.Our City Forest community nursing program manager Gabby Fitts believes the pandemic present a great opportunity to create new holiday traditions that support the environment and family budgets.\"It's a beautiful way to kinda reinvent the holiday tree,\" Fitts says, \"We're living in a weird time so might as well mix up the trees this year.\"Per nursery rules, participants maintain the trees throughout the holiday season before they are planted in Silicon Valley at the start of the new year to combat California's growing deforestation crisis.Maggie Larsen of San Jose came to Our City Forest on Friday to pick out a potted tree with her five-year-old daughter.\"Usually we buy a Christmas tree and throw it out,\" Larsen says, \"and I feel like it's such a waste of money and resources just to grow it and throw it away,\"With regards to the types of trees being offered, Our City Forest said there's something for everyone.\"We do have some traditional, not so much spruces, but there are conifers and evergreens we love to see around the holidays and of course we have the non-traditional trees as well,\" says Fitts.Renting a 5-gallon tree comes with the cost of a $40 tax-deductible donation to the non-profit, whereas 15-gallon trees will run shoppers an $80 donation, and measure between three to six feet tall.\"It encourages residents to rent a living tree that will eventually be planted in Santa Clara County,\" said Fitts. \"It's an effort to reforest and green the places we live and spend 90% of our lives: in urban areas.\"Renters are allowed to place lights, smaller ornaments, and garland on the trees.Our City Forest Nursery and Training Center is located at 1000 Spring St in San Jose.The public can pick up trees from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m. Friday and Saturday from December 4th - 19th.", "title": "Our City Forest nursery in San Jose encourages renting a holiday tree this season", "dataset": "['manual_google_by_location']", "labels": "['sustainability']", "annot_city": "['San Jose']"}, {"id": 8908, "city": null, "url": "https://patch.com/california/campbell/san-jose-bans-natural-gas-new-commercial-buildings", "text": "San Jos\u00e9 Spotlight is the city's first nonprofit news organization dedicated to independent political and business reporting. Please support our public service journalism by clicking here .\n\nThe City Council voted 8-3 on Dec. 1 to approve the ban but in the wake of a public health crisis and not-so-distant memories of PG&E blackouts, lawmakers granted exceptions for hospitals, manufacturing plants, industrial facilities and energy storage companies, which use natural gas to provide a steady stream of fuel in case the grid goes dark.\n\nSan Jose became the largest city in the country to ban natural gas in commercial buildings , but its plan to keep businesses running during a power outage was criticized by activists and lawmakers.\n\nA handful of other California cities have banned natural gas, including Berkeley, Burlingame and Menlo Park. Oakland joined that list Tuesday night, banning it in newly-constructed apartment and commercial buildings.\n\n\"The grid will shut down on us,\" Mayor Sam Liccardo said. \"We are going to have blackouts and when that does happen, it's policies like this that will be the target of scorn. We need to be really clear that we are providing options for those who critically need them.\"\n\nCouncilmembers Raul Peralez, Magdalena Carrasco and Pam Foley opposed the exemptions, specifically for energy distributors. They feared this would promote the continued use of natural gas as an alternate power source.\n\nCOMMENTARY: There's not enough cash in the federal treasury to get over the gut feeling that this former Chicago mayor is bad for America.\n\nCOMMENTARY: There's not enough cash in the federal treasury to get over the gut feeling that this former Chicago mayor is bad for America.\n\n\"I view it as a little bit of step back in terms of our aggressiveness in terms of banning natural gas,\" Romanow said. \"But that step back allows us to move forward more quickly on densification which has other enhanced and steep benefits.\"\n\nKerrie Romanow, director of San Jose's environmental services, Romanow, said the exemptions served to balance the city's climate goals with the needs of San Jose businesses developers.\n\nOlivia Walker with the Natural Resources Defense Council was one of dozens of advocates who spoke in favor of the ban\u2014 minus the exception.\n\n\"This 11th-hour loophole allows unfettered use of fuel cells powered by fracked gas. It's unnecessary and it's counterproductive,\" Walker said. \"A local utility's continuous use of gas-powered fuel cells would compromise the local and global benefits for San Jose's increasingly clean fuel mix, and even create demand for new fossil gas infrastructure\u2013 infrastructure that could not be used for 100% clean energy down the line despite what some have implied.\"\n\nNatural gas burning and fracking\u2014 the process by which the gas is extracted\u2014 are known for releasing toxic compounds into the air which have been linked to respiratory problems and habitat damage, making it unpopular an unpopular electricity source among environmental activists. Yet the gas has been praised for its cleanliness in comparison to fuels such as diesel, which are commonly used to power backup generators.\n\nThe city's goal is to completely eliminate natural gas in the next decade, according to Romanow, but that change needs to take into account how easily the city and businesses can adopt and construct new energy systems.\n\n\"I don't think any of us in the council can claim this is an issue we understand very well,\" Peralez said. \"What I'm most concerned about doing is approving any further exemptions with so little\u2014or what appears to be so little \u2014 analysis and especially when those exemptions come with so much opposition from our environmental advocates that have helped get us to this point.\"\n\nOne San Jose tech company led the charge for the exemption \u2014 Bloom Energy. Its top officials said natural gas and hydrogen can help supply cleaner renewable energy to replace diesel.\n\n\"As a representative of an energy service provider potentially impacted by the policy under discussion, I wanted to reinforce Bloom's value to the businesses in the communities that it serves and highlight the importance of the gas pipeline network to deliver a renewable future,\" said Steven Lamb, director of sustainability for Bloom Energy. \"I want to encourage the council to think of the gas system as an enabler of a renewable future rather than a barrier to it.\"\n\nThe council held an hours-long discussion about fuel cell alternatives, calling on energy experts, a PG&E representative and a professor to explain how the city could provide power during a blackout while also reaching its emissions goal.\n\nCarl Guardino, Bloom Energy's executive vice president of global government affairs and policy, said \"dirty diesel\" is not the answer and that Bloom could provide other fuel options, including battery power and hydrogen power, which the company is piloting in South Korea.\n\nGuardino noted that one in five residents were left without power for almost two days during PG&E blackouts and while diesel generators are effective, they are often placed near schools and in disadvantaged communities, releasing more toxic chemicals than natural gas and causing health problems.\n\n\"That cannot be our destiny for the city of San Jose,\" Guardino said. \"We can do better.\"\n\nCarrasco said the city needed to lead by example by not allowing for the energy supplier exemption. \"Even though it may only be a very small number of cells here, we set the example and it can have a domino effect for the rest of the Bay Area and the rest of the country,\" Carrasco said. \"My concern is that we leave a future for our children that may not be optimal.\"\n\nWhile Carrasco worried about the equity side of environmental issues, Councilmember Diep advocated for business growth.\n\n\"For us to bring Bloom Energy to San Jose and not welcome their products is a concern to me,\" Diep said. \"It's incumbent upon us to allow these innovative companies the space to build that bridge to the future.\"\n\nHe added that Bloom Energy's switch to hydrogen showed its commitment to moving away from natural gas.\n\nJacob Brouwer, a professor at University of California Irvine, said natural gas doesn't have to be a permanent solution for power outages. There is room for hydrogen to move in and become cheaper over time, but only some parts of the city could support it.\n\nThe council will also meet with labor groups and businesses to gather feedback on how best to transition to new energy models and standards.\n\n\"My peers and I were so scared about what's in store that we are spending our teenage years advocating for representatives and leaders to address the climate crisis,\" said San Jose high school student Helen Deng. \"The gas ban is integral to a better future.\"\n\nContact Carly Wipf at carly@sanjosespotlight.com or follow @CarlyChristineW on Twitter.", "title": "San Jose Bans Natural Gas In New Commercial Buildings", "dataset": "['manual_google_by_location']", "labels": "['sustainability', 'energy']", "annot_city": "['San Jose']"}, {"id": 8909, "city": null, "url": "https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2020/12/01/homeless-encampment-goes-up-in-flames-in-san-jose/", "text": "Liam's List Dec. 4: Guide To Fitness, Food, Fun, Staying Connected While Social DistancingKCBS reporter Liam Mayclem will be providing KPIX 5 users with a weekly tip list on how best to survive the current coronavirus outbreak.\n\nHealth Officials Offer Tips For A Safe Halloween In The COVID-19 Era Just days away from Halloween, health officials were offering tips on how to safely celebrate with your children in this era of COVID-19.\n\nLiam's List Oct. 16: Your Guide To Fitness, Food, Fun, Staying Connected While Social DistancingKCBS reporter Liam Mayclem will be providing KPIX 5 users with a weekly tip list on how best to survive the current coronavirus outbreak.\n\nQuarantine Cooking: Your Essential Nonstick Cookware GuideStep up your quarantine cooking with this guide to nonstick cookware.\n\nHow To: 6 Easy Steps To Make Homemade Soft PretzelsLearn how to make your own homemade soft pretzels with these six easy steps!\n\n5 Vodka Sauce Recipes To Try This WeekAnd would you miss it if it wasn't there?", "title": "Homeless Encampment Goes Up In Flames In San Jose", "dataset": "['manual_google_by_location']", "labels": "['accident', 'indirect_city_relation']", "annot_city": "['San Jose']"}, {"id": 8910, "city": null, "url": "https://sanjosespotlight.com/housing-program-for-south-bay-veterans-marks-milestone/", "text": "During the past five years, Destination: Home and its partners have housed 1,940 homeless veterans, making strides towards eliminating veteran homelessness in Santa Clara County.\n\nBy partnering with San Jose, Santa Clara County and nonprofit organizations, Destination: Home said it reached a milestone this year: for the first time, it housed more veterans \u2014 341 \u2014 than those becoming homeless \u2014 259.\n\nBut there\u2019s still much work to do. According to the 2019 homeless count, the most recent available, 653 veterans are still homeless in Santa Clara County. Of those, 68% are unhoused.\n\nThe count also found homelessness is spiking in the county. The county\u2019s homeless population in 2019 jumped to 9,706 people countywide, up 31% from 7,394 individuals two years prior. In San Jose, the overall homeless count was 6,172, an increase of 1,822 over 2017.\n\nStill, Jeff Scott, a spokesperson for San Jose\u2019s housing department, said the city is encouraged to see progress.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great to see we\u2019re moving the needle and making a difference in people\u2019s lives,\u201d Scott said. \u201cIt\u2019s a great real-world success story.\u201d\n\nThe effort is part of the All the Way Home campaign, which was launched on Veterans Day in 2015 by San Jose Mayor Sam Liccardo and Santa Clara County Supervisor Dave Cortese to tackle veteran homelessness in Santa Clara County.\n\nIn 2016, the San Jose City Council set aside $4 million to get the program up and running, Scott said. The investment was used for rental subsidies in the form of grants and forgivable loans for landlords who agreed to rent properties to homeless veterans.\n\n\u201cSome of the landlords we worked with are actually veterans themselves,\u201d Scott said, \u201cso they see it as a way to give back and help fellow veterans, as well as a way to fill their units.\u201d\n\nPartnering with landlords was key to the program\u2019s success. During the past five years, 904 landlords have participated in All the Way Home, some repeatedly.\n\nVeteran Michael Eckhart said he is grateful to have a roof over his head, a shower and food in his refrigerator. Photo courtesy of Michael Eckhart.\n\nMichael Eckhart, 56, and his wife, Jackie Germain, 55, had been homeless for more than 10 years after losing their jobs. Eckhart, who served in the U.S. Navy, said he never expected to be homeless.\n\nBefore being recommended by the San Jose Police Department for permanent housing, Eckhart and Germain lived on $240 a month from her retirement, visiting food pantries and panhandling to get by.\n\nEckhart said he\u2019s grateful for having a roof over his head and being able to shower and eat food from his refrigerator rather than a food pantry. Not having a permanent address made it hard for them to find work, he said.\n\n\u201cWhen doors shut in your face every day, you give up,\u201d said Eckhart, who writes a column about homelessness for this news organization. \u201cBeing housed has put a little bit of faith back into me.\u201d\n\nChad Bojorquez, chief program officer of Destination: Home, said personal well-being and physical and mental health are related to the safety and security of having a home.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most critical thing,\u201d Bojorquez said. \u201cFrom there, you can get a job and be successful. You can have your medical and behavioral health needs addressed and have friends and family and hobbies.\u201d\n\nDestination: Home and its partners also provide veterans with services such as health assistance, reconnecting them with family and procuring military records, birth certificates and driver\u2019s licenses. They also fund career training, drug and alcohol rehabilitation programs, vehicle repairs and childcare.\n\nHomelessness, in addition to suffering, has monetary costs. When people are stably housed, it reduces the need for ambulatory, emergency room and criminal justice system services, Scott said.\n\nIn 2015, Destination: Home and Santa Clara County commissioned an Economic Roundtable study \u201cThe Cost of Homelessness in Silicon Valley.\u201d The study found 104,206 individuals suffered from homelessness at the time.\n\nAccording to the study, from 2007 to 2012, Santa Clara County spent $520 million a year providing services for homeless residents. Health care costs accounted for 53 percent, social services accounted for 13 percent and justice system agencies for 34 percent.\n\nA persistently homeless individual costs the county about $13,661 a year, the study found, and the savings of prioritizing housing for 2,800 persistently homeless people with the highest costs would offset the cost of housing.\n\nFollowing the study, Destination: Home recommended the city and county approach homelessness in population segments. In 2015, as 700 of the existing 7,400 homeless were veterans, it seemed like a good place to start, Cortese said.\n\n\u201cThis was worthwhile and should be continued,\u201d Cortese said. \u201cWe need to keep at it and finish the job. As there will always be veterans coming home, we always need to have a program like this in place.\u201d\n\nBojorquez said the program was helped by receiving political will and community-wide support.\n\n\u201cOur community has done a great job taking accountability and putting together the pieces to support our unhoused community, particularly veterans,\u201d Bojorquez said. \u201cI\u2019m grateful our community has prioritized housing all veterans in Santa Clara County.\u201d\n\nIn addition to connecting homeless veterans with permanent housing, the program partners also placed 114 homeless veterans in motel rooms during COVID-19.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important for people to recognize homelessness is something we can overcome,\u201d Scott said. \u201cWith some commitment, partnership and focused effort, we can make a big difference in our community and in the lives we\u2019re helping.\u201d\n\nContact Lorraine Gabbert at [email protected].\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Jennifer Loving, Chief Executive Officer of Destination: Home, serves on San Jos\u00e9 Spotlight\u2019s Board of Directors.", "title": "Housing program for South Bay veterans marks milestone", "dataset": "['manual_google_by_location']", "labels": "['housing', 'policy']", "annot_city": "['San Jose']"}, {"id": 8911, "city": null, "url": "https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/12/03/from-free-parking-to-delivery-fees-caps-san-jose-considers-new-plans-to-help-its-downtown-businesses/", "text": "From free parking to carry-out drinks to delivery fee caps, San Jose leaders are looking at a wide range of potential policies to aid downtown businesses reeling from the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nSmall business revenue in the San Jose metro area has plunged nearly 40% since January, according to a study from the Harvard University economic tracker.

Goebel said this type of technology is used in hospitals and medical facilities.\n\n\u201cWhat that allows is the bus to continually be disinfecting as it\u2019s traveling down the road,\" he said. \"As I'm breathing or you're breathing, it's continuously being disinfected, killing 99% of viruses, bacteria and mold.\"\n\nAccording to the Barons Bus website, the UV wavelengths used in Far UV lighting are safe for human exposure because they do not penetrate the skin or eyes.\n\nGoebel said they've only been installed in some of the buses currently being used, however, they plan to install the technology on their entire fleet. The total investment will cost nearly $300,000.\n\n\u201cWe have to do this. This is offering the safest ride in the industry. This is what we need to do. This is how we're going to do it - no matter what the cost is to us. We want our riders to feel safe, our employees to feel safe and our drivers to feel safe while they're on the bus,\" Goebel.\n\nGoebel said Barons Bus is the first in the charter bus industry to install this type of UV technology inside charter buses and already they've been taking calls from other companies who are interested in similar moves.\n\n\"This not only helps us, but it's going to help the entire industry move forward once we get past this COVID-19,\" he said.\n\n", "title": "Cleveland-based charter bus company installing UV lighting that continually disinfects buses", "dataset": "['manual_google_by_location']", "labels": "['transportation', 'health']", "annot_city": "['Cleveland']"}, {"id": 8917, "city": null, "url": "https://www.crainscleveland.com/education/cleveland-metropolitan-school-district-fortifies-career-paths-strong-industry", "text": "Eric Gordon, superintendent and CEO of the Cleveland Metropolitan School District, doesn't think of post-secondary options as college or career anymore.\n\nEveryone's preparing for a career; it's just about the path they take to get there.\n\n\"It is career, period. And college is one pathway to career, but the end goal is career,\" Gordon said.\n\nThat idea has led the district to adjust its approach to post-secondary preparation, offering students who don't plan to attend college just as much counseling and support as those who do through its new Linking CMSD Students to Career Pathways and Living Wage Jobs program.\n\nThe program, known as career pathways for short, was first launched in September 2019.\n\nBut this work has been a long time in the making. More than a decade ago, the district reorganized its high schools to put a focus on exploring career pathways. That laid the groundwork for stronger industry partnerships, as the district created advisory boards for the schools.\n\nDespite this foundation, Gordon said there was a gap between the in-demand jobs in the community and the jobs students were pursuing. Students weren't being seen as \"future employees,\" he said.\n\nIn January 2019, the Cleveland Metropolitan School District became part of the Say Yes to Education initiative, which provides support for students, as well as scholarships for those who want to pursue traditional post-secondary education. But when it comes to preparing students for life after high school, that's just one option, and it didn't account for micro-credentials or other direct-to-the-workforce options, Gordon said. The district needed a way to support students taking that path to work, too.\n\nGordon views the district as the convener in the career pathways work, bringing the necessary parties together. It's an \"ecosystem,\" he said, one that includes everyone from industry partners to employer-serving agencies to foundations.\n\nTake Cleveland State University, for example. The university partners with the Cleveland Metropolitan School District on its college pathway work, obviously, but it's involved in the career-focused pathways, too. One of the newest ways the university is working with the district is through the Cleveland Tech Talent Pipeline project, which aims to strengthen pathways for computer science and IT careers.\n\nCleveland State president Harlan Sands thinks bachelor's degrees are still one of the best ways to change wealth disparities \u2014 and he wants to make those pathways easier and faster \u2014 but the university wants to be involved at different levels for the district. Cleveland State offers some professional development and credential programs, and there are always students who will opt for post-secondary education at a later date.\n\nCurrently, there are three working groups in the district's career pathways program. One group is creating a career exploration program for students in grades 6 to 12. Gordon said that program will start to be implemented next fall. Another group is working to create programs that directly connect employers and students. That group will work to incorporate existing internship and apprenticeship programs in the district, as well as create new ones in high-demand sectors. And the third group is focused on supporting graduating seniors.\n\nAs the district grows its career preparation supports, it also wanted to support students who would graduate before those new programs were put in place. That work started last spring.\n\nThe timing of the program meant that it has been complicated by the pandemic, as schooling went virtual. And when the work started, the economy was in a place of strength. Employers needed employees, so there was a clear benefit to them working with the district. That's no longer the case.\n\n\"And yet, employers have not lost enthusiasm,\" Gordon said. \"They're still engaged. They're still working with us.\"\n\nOne example is the district's work with United Airlines Inc., which started getting involved with Cleveland's Davis Aerospace and Maritime High School earlier this year.\n\nPhil Griffith, vice president of supply chain, technical operations, said he came across a video of a young woman studying at Davis who was taking her first solo flight. He thought she was just the kind of student the airline wanted to help in a city that it served, and he reached out to the school.\n\nThe airline has been working to increase diversity and improve career opportunities for underrepresented groups, Griffith said. And that work has continued despite the pandemic. A company's core values need to be there during good times and bad, Griffith said.\n\n\"Doing good work happens all the time. If you wait for every crisis to go away, that means you'll never do anything,\" he said.\n\nThe airline has committed to free flight lessons for students, and it will expose students to all kinds of jobs with the airline at nearby Cleveland Hopkins International Airport, Gordon said. It's even working to have students build products like commemorative gifts for employees in the school's industrial lab.\n\nGriffith said Davis is the first school that United has had such a strong partnership with, but the airline hopes to see that expand in other communities.\n\nAnother quickly growing partnership is with MAGNET, the Manufacturing Advocacy and Growth Network in Cleveland.\n\nMAGNET has been working with the district to connect students to careers in a variety of ways over the years, from its Early College, Early Career youth apprenticeship program to the region's workforce-focused manufacturing sector partnership. The career pathways program just expands those efforts.\n\nAnd, in a couple of years, MAGNET plans to relocate to an old district school building, an idea that president and CEO Ethan Karp said came up during a career pathways meeting. As part of the move and renovation, MAGNET will offer manufacturing experiences to more Cleveland students, including those in the earlier grades.\n\nUltimately, all of this work benefits students by exposing them to high-paying jobs, Karp said. And it benefits manufacturers who are struggling to find the workers they need.\n\nAnd for MAGNET, picking a new building in Hough and using it to work with Cleveland Metropolitan School District students sends an intentional message: \"This is the future of manufacturing,\" Karp said.\n\n\"The folks that live in Hough, the folks that are coming out of CMSD: This is where you should be looking for future talent,\" he said.", "title": "Cleveland Metropolitan School District fortifies career paths with strong industry partnerships", "dataset": "['manual_google_by_location']", "labels": "['school', 'employment']", "annot_city": "['Cleveland']"}, {"id": 8918, "city": null, "url": "https://www.crainscleveland.com/letters-editor/letters-editor-reasons-optimism-downtown-cleveland", "text": "In Crain's Nov. 16 issue, there was a letter to the editor advocating for downtown development in Cleveland to essentially hit the \"pause\" button for fear of overbuilding apartments. There is no doubt that Cleveland is at an inflection point \u2014 as are many other Midwest cities that have experienced a similar downtown revitalization and development boom over the last decade and are now suffering during the pandemic. But with a vaccine within arm's reach, existing buildings and sites ripe for development or redevelopment, and still untapped demand downtown, I respectfully disagree with the suggestion for developers to be \"cautious and patient.\" Rather, now is the time to hit the gas, not the brakes.\n\nThe building blocks for successful development in Cleveland over the last 10 years have been low interest rates, increasing population downtown creating demand, tax credit programs to tap into, and available real estate. Those building blocks haven't changed. Sure, the pandemic has forced many businesses into tough decisions, and forced some retailers into closing their doors for good. My clients are mostly owners of office buildings and office tenants throughout Northeast Ohio. The conversations we were having in April about office space needs are very different than the conversations that took place in November.\n\nFor the companies I advise, owners of businesses are anxious to get back into the office. It's difficult to build a culture and work collaboratively when everyone is working from home. Work from home may end up being significantly more prevalent than it was pre-COVID, but office space is still a necessity for many, if not most, businesses. A declining population in the metro area was referenced in the letter, which is true. But the neighborhoods that are growing significantly in population (Gordon Square, Ohio City, downtown) are the very areas that developers are focusing on. These areas can support more thoughtful and appropriately scaled development. You ask if 20,000 residents and 105,000 daytime office workers can hold up. With dozens of development projects currently underway, the pending relocation of the Sherwin-Williams headquarters to Public Square, the massive investment going to public parks such as Irishtown Bend, the Towpath Trail and Canal Basin Park (to name a few) and all the economic building blocks still in place for the continuation of Cleveland's continued renaissance, and I think Cleveland is poised for an even brighter future.

The Enquirer surveyed the state lawmakers who represent Boone, Kenton and Campbell counties to ask: How do you plan to fund the Brent Spence Bridge upgrades?\n\nOnly four of the region's 13 lawmakers responded, two Democrats and two Republicans.

Please explain why or why not.\n\nIf you don\u2019t support tolls, and with the federal government $27 trillion in debt, how would you propose the project be funded?\n\nKenton County Rep. Buddy Wheatley:\n\nWheatley said he would support a toll on thru-traffic, which would include, for example, freight drivers and vacationers. It would not include tolls on Northern Kentucky residents who use the bridge to go to work in Cincinnati.\n\n\"For the Brent Spence Bridge, given the greater impact to the state and region, tolling might cover a small percentage of funding, with some residents and businesses being exempt, or greatly reduced in their proportional share,\" Wheatley said in his emailed statement.\n\nHe added that the federal government should pay for at least 50% of the cost.\n\nKenton and Boone County Rep. Savannah Maddox:\n\n\"Tolls are not the answer,\" Maddox said in an emailed statement to The Enquirer.\n\nShe views the toll bridges that connect Louisville to Indiana as a \"cautionary tale,\" because traffic has decreased on the toll bridges while increasing on nearby non-tolled options.\n\n\"The end result is that Kentucky has incurred debt for a project based on toll fee projections that may or may not come to fruition as drivers intentionally seek out toll-free routes,\" she said.\n\nMaddox suggested the U.S. Congress increase funding for highway projects, which would allow Kentucky to allocate its funds for a project like the Brent Spence Bridge.\n\nCampbell County Rep.

That's because she believes tolls would burden local communities and disproportionally affect lower-income families.\n\nSince the Brent Spence Bridge is a vital artery for U.S. commerce, Roberts said the funding burden should not fall solely on Ohio and Kentucky. She suggested a large amount of the money should come from the federal government.\n\nThere have been attempts on the federal level to help, she pointed out.\n\nIn 2011, President Barack Obama introduced a bill that could have funded the bridge project.

Its original design was meant to accommodate 80,000 vehicles per day.\n\nA new bridge would not replace the current one. It would be built next to it to increase capacity, according to the Brent Spence Bridge Corridor website, created by the Ohio Department of Transportation and the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet. The $2.5 billion would also improve several miles of highway leading to and from the bridge.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the funding war commenced.

(3CDC) plan to convert their temporary expanded outdoor dining program into a permanent feature on the streets of Downtown and Over-the-Rhine.\n\nThe temporary program was rolled out in mid-May, as restaurants and bars that had been required to close during the shutdown were given permission to reopen with outdoor dining. The city coordinated with 3CDC to create the dining areas. The pilot program\u2019s success led the city to explore making it permanent.\n\nThe $2 million effort will involve converting the temporary sites into \u201cStreateries\u201d \u2013 a combination of parklets and concrete bump-outs/sidewalk expansions.\n\nThe city also proposes shutting down portions of four streets for outdoor dining: 15th Street from Vine Street to Parvis Alley; 15th Street from Race to Goose Alley; 14th Street from Race Street to Republic Street; and Broadway from 12th Street to 13th Street in Pendleton.\n\n\u201cMaking these outdoor dining areas permanent will not only provide bars and restaurants with valuable expanded seating, but they will also generate added vibrancy in the urban core, provide important traffic-calming features to our streets, and will be much more aesthetically pleasing than the construction barriers currently in use,\u201d Mayor John Cranley said\n\nBars and restaurants in the urban core that do not have temporary outdoor seating will also be eligible for the program.\n\nThe project will be funded primarily by the city, with contributions from the Devou Good Foundation, the Duke Energy Foundation, and The Carol Ann and Ralph V.

He later died from his injuries, police said.\n\nWith this death, the 88 killings in Cincinnati in 2020 ties the worst year on record.\n\nThe city's homicide rate based on population is already higher than any other year on record.\n\nIn 2006, there were also 88 homicides during the entire year.\n\nHomicides have slowed in Cincinnati since August, but not enough to offset the increase in killings during the spring and summer.\n\nOver the past three years, Cincinnati has had an average of 34 homicides between April and August. This year, the city had 54.\n\nThe Enquirer maintains annual homicide statistics dating back to 1959. These totals include killings that were ruled to have been made in self-defense.\n\nWhile 2020 has matched 2006 as the worst year for homicides, this year has already surpassed it in terms of the city's homicide rate due to Cincinnati's slightly lower population.\n\nThere have been 28.7 deaths per 100,000 people this year. This rate will only increase if more homicides happen this year.\n\nHomicides and gun crimes have spiked nationally.\n\nColumbus and Louisville have both surpassed their all-time records for homicides in a single year. Columbus passed its prior high on Nov. 13. Louisville did the same on Sept. 19.\n\nBoth of those cities are metro-style governments, which means they have annexed larger portions of their home counties than Cincinnati.\n\nWhere people are being killed\n\nAvondale has had more killings than any other neighborhood in Cincinnati this year with 14. Westwood has had nine. Seven people have been killed in West End. East Price Hill, Mount Airy and Over-the-Rhine have all had six.\n\nThese six neighborhoods account for more than half of the homicides across Cincinnati's 52 neighborhoods. The six neighborhoods contain about a quarter of the population of the city, based on estimates from multiple sources.\n\nWho is being killed\n\nSo far this year, 16 women have been killed. Of those, 13 have been Black. It's the worst year on record for women homicides, according to Cincinnati police data dating back to 2000.\n\nWomen account for just under 20% of the homicides this year, which is not out of line with the proportion seen in previous years, but domestic violence experts have said stay-at-home orders and additional economic stress have prompted a sharp increase in violence against women.\n\nLess than 10% of 2020's homicide victims are white. The city's population is about 50% white.\n\nA total of 45 people have been arrested in connection with 50 of the homicides. Several men are charged in more than one death. Of those, 42 are male and all but three are Black.\n\nGun violence rages\n\nGun violence in Cincinnati is also poised to break records this year, resetting the significant reduction of shootings over the past four years.\n\nAs of Nov. 24, there had been 450 shootings in the city. If shootings continue at the same rate, Cincinnati could see around 500 by New Year's Day.\n\nThe city began systematically tracking gun violence in 2008. Since then, there have been between 400 and 500 shootings most years with a peak of 479 shootings in 2015.\n\nBut 2018 and 2019 were the lowest years on record with 336 and 356 shootings respectively. In 2020, there were more shootings than that by the first day of September.\n\nThe aforementioned six neighborhoods with the most homicides account for 46% of shootings, but Winton Hills and Roselawn have also had significant gun violence.\n\nWhat's being done by city\n\nAs of Nov. 24, the Cincinnati Police Department was reporting that 64% of this year's homicide cases had been solved.\n\nThe department also re-instituted its gun violence task force. This year, 1,353 firearms recovered by police have been or are slated to be destroyed. That is a 38% increase over the number recovered year-to-date in 2019.\n\nThe city has also partnered with the U.S. Attorney's Office of the Southern District of Ohio to pursue federal charges for gun crimes, in part, by providing a city-paid attorney to work in the federal office.\n\nThe rationale is the federal sentences are stiffer than Ohio sentences in many cases.\n\nSince the initiative was launched, 36 people have been charged federally. Most are charged with possessing a firearm as a convicted felon, a crime that carries a three-year maximum sentence under Ohio law, but a 10-year maximum sentence federally.\n\nMayor John Cranley and Cincinnati Police Chief Eliot Isaac have also begun a plan to hire community organizers as a way to strengthen relationships in violent areas. Isaac said this can make murders easier to solve and harder to commit because offenders won't think that residents will stay silent.\n\n\u201cA tragic side effect of the pandemic has been a nationwide increase in shootings. Cincinnati is not immune to that,\u201d Cranley said. \u201cLast night\u2019s homicide places a sad exclamation point on a very difficult year.\u201d\n\nCranley said the increased police presence and a partnership with the FBI\u2019s ATF, violent crime have worked to decrease violence in recent months.\n\n\u201cBut we simply can not undo the spike we experienced during the first wave of COVID,\u201d Cranley said. \u201cWe are always looking for new strategies to fight crime.\u201d\n\nCommunity groups are also trying to keep their anti-violence work moving forward.\n\nEnnis Tait Ministries and Cincinnati Works hosted rally demonstrations this summer where they displayed 73 body bags in high-crime areas to raise awareness for the rise in killings.\n\nWhy is the spike happening\n\nEverytown for Gun Safety has said gun violence has risen due to the economic crisis brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic which has disproportionately affected low-income areas.\n\nGun violence intervention programs and police-community relationships have also been strained due to restrictions on large gatherings and social-distancing protocols.\n\nDuring the stay-at-home, Cincinnati police officials said there was a lack of \"natural surveillance\" because fewer people were out of the streets. When fewer people are likely to see or report a shooting, it may lead to brazen acts, officials said.\n\nWhen Cincinnati surpassed last year's total number of homicides in just nine months, Ennis Tait of Ennis Tait Ministries pointed out it was primarily affecting the African American community. He said that made it easier for city officials to ignore.\n\nHe said funding was needed urgently in the hardest-hit areas to provide people opportunities beyond pulling the trigger of a gun.\n\nSince then the city issued Tait and his organization a $20,000 grant to ramp up youth intervention. The idea is if kids can be steered away from street life early enough, violence can be prevented on a widespread scale.\n\nHe said living amongst poverty and crime is traumatizing and that trauma leads to violence later in life.\n\n\"We don't address it,\" Tait said. \"We have to address youth trauma like we do COVID-19. All hands on deck and working tirelessly.\"\n\nHe said the trust between police and the community also needs work. The Black community has historically mistrusted police, but police have lost trust in the ability of the community to help them, he said.\n\nCity Councilman Christopher Smitherman, who leads the law and public safety committee, called the gun violence unacceptable on Sunday.\n\n\u201cThe \u2018no snitch\u2019 culture is undermining citizens' ability to have safe neighborhoods and receive justice they deserve,\u201d Smitherman said. \u201cWe all must denounce this destructive behavior and loudly voice a zero tolerance for the violence in our streets.\u201d", "title": "Cincinnati now has 88 homicides, matching yearly record", "dataset": "['manual_google_by_location']", "labels": "['crime']", "annot_city": "['Cincinnati']"}, {"id": 8929, "city": null, "url": "https://rnbcincy.com/358094/cincinnati-police-say-gun-recoveries-are-up-in-2020/", "text": "Gun recoveries are up in Cincinnati according to the Police.

The ever-popular \u201cNutcracker\u201d ballet and other seasonal performances will not be live on stage.\n\n\u201cTo lose those shows that are here every single year and are really a mainstay of what we host at the Ohio Theatre, it\u2019s certainly disappointing,\u201d says Chad Whittington, president and CEO of the Columbus Association for the Performing Arts (CAPA). \u201cIt\u2019s a tough year.\u201d\n\nWhittington says while most of the money from ticket sales for \u201cThe Nutcracker\u201d would go to Ballet Met, CAPA does receive $3.50 for every ticket sold.\n\n\u201cLast year, it was roughly 22 performances that brought in almost 40,000 people to the Ohio Theatre, so that\u2019s a lot of financial impact,\u201d Whittington says.\n\nThe total impact is nearly $3 million from all CAPA's holiday shows, including \u201cA Christmas Carol\u201d and Holiday Pops with the Columbus Symphony, amounting to about 15% of the organization's annual revenues.\n\n\u201cWe get rent revenue for renting the building,\u201d Whittington says. \u201cWe get the concessions when folks are in the building.

It then laid off more than half of its full-time employees, about 45 people, in July.\n\n\u201cMost of them have lost their ability to earn a living right now, and like folks in a lot of industry sectors, they\u2019re struggling,\u201d Whittington says.\n\nSue Porter, executive director of Ballet Met, says her organization will lose more than $2 million from the cancellation of all its fall and holiday performances, including \u201cThe Nutcracker.\u201d That\u2019s nearly 30% of annual revenues of $7 million.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re an organization that has clearly prided itself on having earned revenue, but without being able to have the earned revenue, we\u2019ve had to ask for more contributed revenue,\u201d Porter says.\n\nPorter says Ballet Met donors have contributed enough money to rehire 23 professional dancers in January. In place of the staged show, Ballet Met has produced a virtual experience called \u201cA Nutcracker Holiday,\" which is available now.\n\nWhittington says some of CAPA's other holiday performances will be presented virtually with old footage of shows. Now that CAPA has obtained the technology for virtual performances, he says will be used as another tool to reach an audience.\n\n\u201cAt the Palace Theatre, for example, you can only fit 2,700 people into the theatre for a performance,\u201d says Whittington. \u201cFrom a virtual perspective, you don\u2019t have that capacity limit. It is an opportunity to make more people aware of the things that go on.\u201d\n\nWhittington says he is optimistic for 2021, when a COVID-19 vaccine is expected to be distributed across the country, but he understands returning to in-person events will take time.\n\n\u201cRealistically, performing arts like stadiums and other places where people need to be there in large numbers, we\u2019re going to be one of the last that gets the opportunity to reopen,\" Whittington says.\n\nCAPA is hoping to resume some version of \u201cnormal\u201d performances by next September.", "title": "Columbus Arts Organizations Take Financial Hit As Holiday Season Goes Virtual", "dataset": "['manual_google_by_location']", "labels": "['entertainment']", "annot_city": "['Columbus']"}, {"id": 8940, "city": null, "url": "https://eu.dispatch.com/story/news/2020/12/07/police-investigations-run-out-cash-again/3823098001/", "text": "Investigations into Columbus police conduct during riots about to run out of cash, again\n\nBill Bush | The Columbus Dispatch\n\nThe city contract with a law firm to investigate potential Columbus police misconduct during protests and riots earlier this year is still ongoing, though if it's not already out of money, it's close.\n\nAs of Sept. 30, when the city Department of Public Safety received its last invoice from BakerHostetler, the investigation had almost depleted the $550,000 allocated it by the Columbus City Council.

Ginther after what many city officials perceived to be excessive uses of force by officers during anti-police protestors in the wake of George Floyd's death in Minneapolis police custody in May.\n\nThe contract was originally set at $50,000, then was expanded in July with the approval of the city council to $550,000.\n\nWhen the law firm's first conclusions were returned in mid-September, many local officials said they were underwhelmed.\n\nMore: Ohio State's review of Downtown Columbus protests asking to speak to participants\n\nOf the 36 incidents of potential rule-breaking by officers, 22 investigations had concluded with only one officer found to be in violation of a division directive.

You get so connected to nature, and the rocking of the boat lets you feel every wave. With so much water around though, you may be wondering - where are the best places to kayak? That\u2019s why we\u2019ve scouted around to bring you the very best places in Virginia Beach to paddle your kayak! Check out what\u2019s on offer.\n\nBack Bay\n\nPerhaps one of the most interesting features of Back Bay is its proximity to the Atlantic Ocean. Despite the fact the bay runs so closely to the ocean, the two are separated for about 65 miles in length - finally connecting in the Oregon Inlet, NC. What may be just as remarkable is that the Back Bay has very low salt content. This makes it far more refreshing to take a dip during the hotter months, if that interests you.\n\nThis picturesque wildlife refuge allows small boat launches, perfect for a kayak exploration of the area. Located in the Sandbridge area, you can surround yourself with various different animals, such as deer, otters, and bobcats. Of course, there are plenty of birds to spot too, so if you have a penchant for birdwatching, you\u2019ll definitely enjoy your time here.\n\nBroad Bay\n\nKayaking along Broad Bay can sometimes feel like a trip back in time. You are surrounded by fascinating wildlife, who are completely undisturbed by your presence. Birds such as Osprey, Herons and Egrets will be visible almost all-year-round, but if you visit in October, you may get lucky and see an eagle. Occasionally, you may also spot a Ray or a Dolphin swimming about. Whether you visit in Spring, Summer, or Fall, you\u2019re always bound to see at least one captivating aspect of nature.\n\nIf you want to paddle in the Broad Bay, then I\u2019d advise visiting the First Landing State Park, and launching from there. If you want to explore as part of a guided tour, then Kayak Nature Tours is a great option. They can provide you with loads of information and help you get the most out of your trip to Broad Bay.\n\nChesapeake Bay\n\nIf you fancy a romantic kayaking trip, why not take a sunset dolphin-watching tour of Chesapeake Bay? Amongst sights of Atlantic bottlenose dolphins, you\u2019ll also find impressive landmarks. The Cape Henry Lighthouse is particularly historic, having been built in 1881. The water isn\u2019t very difficult to manage, as long as the weather is good. This also makes it a fantastic fishing spot, so if you\u2019re interested in fishing and kayaking, you\u2019ll have the best of both worlds here.\n\nWhether you\u2019re a complete beginner or an experienced kayaker, you\u2019re bound to enjoy the experience of paddling along the Chesapeake Bay, especially if you have company. It\u2019s a spot I urge you to visit, especially at sunset.\n\nLinkhorn Bay\n\nOne of many inland bays in Virginia Beach, Linkhorn Bay is a brilliant way to see local wildlife. Thanks to the calm waters, this location is perfect for complete beginners getting into kayaking too! There are guided tours of the area, with groups reported to see dolphins, cow nose rays, herons, and even eagles.\n\nIf you want to launch without a tour, the easiest access would be from Birdneck Launch. This way, you can easily explore all the natural wonders that Linkhorn Bay has to offer. Whether you decide to go solo, with a friend, or as a tour, you\u2019re sure to enjoy the amazing experiences Linkhorn Bay has available.\n\nParadise Creek Nature Park\n\nA finger of the Elizabeth River, the Paradise Creek Nature Park has been lovingly restored by the Elizabeth River Project since 2001. Once heavily polluted and unable to sustain life, the incredible efforts of the Elizabeth River Project and partners have allowed an emerging ecosystem to take root.\n\nNow you can paddle through the restored salt marsh, amongst native grasses, and beside red wing blackbirds, osprey, and even otters. A lot of work has gone into reviving this small slice of paradise, and now you can visit it for yourself. I would highly suggest that you do.\n\nElizabeth River Park\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a little more energy around you when you\u2019re paddling, then the Elizabeth River Park could be for you. The park is accessible both by water and by land, so you\u2019re more than welcome to paddle into it or launch there. This makes it a great place to stop if you\u2019re on a longer journey.\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of fishing, then feel free to bring your gear along. Since no fishing licenses are required, you can catch to your heart\u2019s content. There is also a Snack Shack located in the park, so if you (or any of your group) fancy a quick bite, then you can simply hop onto land and grab some food and drink.\n\nWest Neck Creek\n\nPlenty of wetland wildlife are waiting for you in the West Neck Creek. This picturesque creek off the North Landing River presents a brilliant opportunity to explore natural waterways, regardless of your skill level. The gentle creek trail is nearly 6km in length, which makes it a brilliant choice for a range of water-based activities.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to launch, the best spot is the West Neck Marina. You can park in the car park, and launch your kayak straight into the creek. Paddling between partially submerged trees is a unusual experience the first couple of times you do it, but it\u2019s still an amazing one. The adventure can become even better, since some visitors have reported seeing jumping fish.\n\nLynnhaven River\n\nThe Lynnhaven River is a beautiful natural area that fully supports aquatic exploration and interest for all ages. It is home to the world\u2019s second-largest restoration program for oyster reef restoration, and receives large amounts of kayaking, fishing, ecotourism, and educational observation.\n\nIf you are paddling in the Lynnhaven River, it\u2019s important to remember that the depth of the water can carry dramatically. Both the tides and the wind can cause a change in depth, between 3 inches and 4 feet.\n\nPaddling along the river can also allow you a sneaky peak at some of the most luxurious available in Virginia Beach, which can be interesting if you have an interest in architexture. If more natural sights strike your fancy, there is plenty of wildlife to catch a glimpse of - so make sure you bring a spotters guide!\n\nAtlantic Ocean\n\nOne for the more experienced kayakers, the ocean waves will be a lot more challenging than the still waters of the rivers and creeks. You\u2019ll have to launch from Rudee Inlet or Little Island Park, but paddling out to the ocean is quite easy.\n\nOnce you\u2019re out on the ocean, you can fully explore the Atlantic Coast. You can also paddle along the beaches, if you don\u2019t feel comfortable straying too far away from land.\n\nAnd that\u2019s our list. Whether you\u2019re planning to paddle somewhere new, or visiting Virginia Beach for the first time, there will be something suited to your skill level and personal preferences. So go, explore all the magical things Virginia Beach has to show you!", "title": "Best Places To Kayak in Virginia Beach", "dataset": "['manual_google_by_location']", "labels": "['entertainment', 'not_sure']", "annot_city": "['Virginia Beach']"}, {"id": 8943, "city": null, "url": "https://www.wtkr.com/news/2-suspects-in-custody-after-firearm-violation-police-chase-at-virginia-beach-mall", "text": "VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. - Two people are in custody after a brief police chase when Virginia Beach Police responded to a firearm violation at the Parkway Plaza Shopping Mall Thursday night.\n\nNo injuries were reported.\n\nThere is no further information.\n\nVBPD on scene of a firearm violation at the Parkway Plaza Shopping Mall. 2 suspects are in custody after a brief pursuit.

Cooper issued executive orders stating that utilities were to discontinue disconnections.\n\nCharlotte Water will still work with customers:\n\n\u2014 No disconnects: Continuing the temporary practice of not disconnecting customers for delinquent account balances,\n\n\u2014No late fees: Waiving the 1.5 percent late fee on past due balances,\n\n\u2014Payment arrangements: Automatically placing customers with past due balances as of Sept. 30 on a 12-month, no interest payment arrangement beginning with the October 2020 bill\n\n\u2014Financial assistance: Using existing partnerships with Crisis Assistance Ministry, The Housing Partnership, Common Wealth Charlotte, and other organizations as models to further develop assistance programs with local non-profits.\n\nClick here for more info. You can call 311 for assistance.\n\nCharlotte Water strongly encourages any customers experiencing financial hardships to seek assistance with one of the four assistance programs.

In the months since, the organization, a nonprofit called Friends of Queens Park, has been working behind the scenes to push the plan forward. The group has:\n\nMet with local neighborhood advisory groups to gather input on everything from concerns over gentrification to ways to hold events in the park.\n\nGarnered support from prominent policymakers such as city planner Taiwo Jaiyeoba.\n\nExpanded its board.\n\nBrought in engineers to determine how this plan would work, and how much it would cost.\n\nThe 2040 Center City Vision Plan, a recently shared city document aimed to shape growth in Uptown and nearby neighborhoods, specifically mentions Queens Park as a \u201cbig idea\u201d to consider.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve gone from a kernel of an idea to something that\u2019s endorsed by major policymakers in Charlotte,\u201d said Eric Spengler, a local attorney who serves as the executive director of Friends of Queens Park.\n\nWhy it matters: Charlotte is in the midst of planning the future of its infrastructure for the next several decades \u2014 including buses, light rail, roads, greenways, and sidewalks.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo fund all of the area\u2019s transit needs, city leaders are considering a one-cent sales tax hike that voters and state leaders would have to approve. The group advising the city on the transit needs and recommending the sales tax is the Charlotte Moves Task Force, which former Charlotte Mayor Harvey Gantt heads. Spengler says he plans to engage with the task force to collaborate on goals and funding.\n\nThe need for green space: Queens Park would be the area bordered on the west and east by North Tryon and Brevard streets, then Matheson Avenue and 16th Street to its north and south.\n\nCharlotte leaders have acknowledged the need for more green space. A recent study ranked Charlotte 95th of all 100 major U.S. cities for access to parks.\n\nAt the same time, Charlotte is becoming less car-centric. This fall, city council approved plans for a car-free apartment development in Seversville. The city\u2019s been working to trim the wait time for buses down in an effort to improve ridership, too.\n\n\u201cThis ties into the larger conversation Charlotte is having (about transportation),\u201d Spengler says.\n\nBut the ambitious plan comes with a major asterisk: Norfolk Southern owns the land the park would occupy.\n\nAnd the railroad giant hasn\u2019t always been cooperative with local transit plans.\n\nFor years, the Charlotte Area Transit System has considered a Lake Norman commuter train, the Red Line, to connect Charlotte to northern towns like Huntersville, Cornelius, and Davidson. As a cost-saving measure, CATS has proposed using Norfolk Southern\u2019s tracks that run parallel to Interstate 77 for the Red Line.\n\nSo far, Norfolk Southern has refused, calling the plan \u201cfatally flawed,\u201d the Observer wrote in 2014. The railroad transports slow-moving coal on those lines, and has said it\u2019s not possible for freight trains and commuter trains to share tracks. \u201cUntil the NS passenger rail policy changes there is no path forward,\u201d CATS has said.\n\nNorfolk Southern did not respond to a request for comment for this story.\n\nBuilding an entirely new rail would be too expensive, so the project remains paused.\n\nA central park for Charlotte is \u201csuch a cool concept,\u201d says Mayor Pro Tem Julie Eiselt. But the Norfolk Southern hurdle is a big one. And the city wants a commuter line to Lake Norman.\n\nBut, she adds, \u201cthe Red Line would probably be the city\u2019s top priority with regards to negotiating with Norfolk Southern.\u201d\n\nJaiyeoba, the city planner, spoke with the Queens Park team this fall and says he was impressed with their passion and work.\n\n\u201cI know there is much more to be done (Norfolk Southern etc.) but I have asked them to stay engaged in the process and see how we can be of support,\u201d Jaiyeoba said in an email.\n\nHow it would work: Theoretically, if the Queens Park plan came to fruition, Norfolk Southern would have to agree to give up, sell, or swap the land.\n\n\u201cThe railroad here holds all the cards. It\u2019s still their land and until we reach an agreement with them, it\u2019s not a done deal,\u201d says Spengler, the head of Friends of Queens Park.\n\nHe hasn\u2019t lost hope, though. \u201cWe haven\u2019t heard anything to make us think this cannot happen.\u201d\n\nRenderings courtesy of Odell, the local urban design firm with whom Friends of Queens Park is working (it\u2019s also Harvey Gantt\u2018s old firm) and Stantec\u2019s Urban Places, a planning, architecture, and engineering firm.

Think of it as, setting up your children to be more successful than you were. While there have been many strides towards equality in Milwaukee and nationwide, it doesn\u2019t mean things are equitable.\n\nAn example could be paying off a house can be a step towards generating generational wealth for future generations. We know homeownership rates for African Americans in the City of Milwaukee are significantly lower than that of their white counterparts, making economic mobility even more difficult.\n\nThese underlying flaws to the system impact African Americans more heavily. Homeownership rates are as low as they are as a result of decades old racist policies like redlining. The impacts can be seen in quality education, employment rates and income as well.\n\nTake this example; 56.9 percent of white, high school dropouts are employed in Milwaukee. On the contrary, 50.5 percent of Black, high school graduates are employed.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have the same opportunities,\u201d Marjorie Rucker, Exec. Dir. Of the Business Council said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the same access to knowledge on how to do things as our white counterparts do.\u201d\n\nRucker\u2019s focus is on helping minority business owners excel. She says that\u2019s part of economic mobility; creating opportunity for one to benefit all.\n\n\u201cIf you have a business that starts at five employees and grows to 10 or 15 in a year, that\u2019s huge for a community,\u201d Rucker said. \u201cWe talk about businesses, as far as an impact on the tax base, property values, and whatnot, but people who live in a particular community or contribute, that\u2019s huge as well.\u201d\n\nAs much as that can help a community, the opportunity just isn\u2019t there for African Americans in Milwaukee. The University of Wisconsin \u2013 Milwaukee, recently published a report on the State of Black Milwaukee. One section focused on white and Black children born into poor households in between 1978 and 1983.\n\nToday, the white children make 80 percent more than the Black children.\n\n\"How do you tell a child they live in a world where they are not considered valuable unless it\u2019s a benefit to someone else?\u201d Rucker said. \u201cI think that\u2019s the hardest conversation to have.\u201d\n\nIn order to make strides for future generations, Rucker urges parents to talk to their kids about all of the options for their future. Rucker says she is riddled with debt from pursuing a Bachelor's degree and a law degree. She says, of course she\u2019s proud of her achievements but has had thoughts about how different her life would be financially had she pursued a trade.\n\n\u201cThere may have been a trade I was good at,\u201d Rucker said. \u201cI could be a master electrician and make more money than I do right now. Or, I could have pursued some other opportunities that would have given me what I wanted for life. I really think that Black parents need to allow their children to explore what it is they like to do and give them the opportunity to explore.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s perfectly acceptable to pursue a traditional 4-year degree, Rucker says to push kids to see what they really want to do with their lives.\n\n\u201cDo the research and open their minds to other possibilities,\u201d Rucker said. \u201cSo, if they want to go to college and they want to be an astronaut, that\u2019s great. If they want to be a mortician, that\u2019s equally necessary and responsible as well. It\u2019s really just learning about what\u2019s out there and letting them pursue their opportunities but letting them know there\u2019s more than just the path that might be told to them that you need to do.\u201d\n\nRucker says things could get worse before they get better because of the pandemic. She says there are estimates that 50 percent of Black-owned businesses may fail as a result of COVID-19. She fears this could cause more turmoil in the pursuit of Black economic mobility.\n\n\u201cWill we see exponential change in the next five years?\u201d Rucker said. \u201cThat\u2019s unlikely. Hopefully, we will be able to create good systems or impacts that could work for our communities and start to bring them where they need to be.\u201d\n\nReport a typo or error // Submit a news tip", "title": "Economic mobility significantly more difficult for Milwaukee African Americans", "dataset": "['manual_google_by_location']", "labels": "['inequality', 'employment']", "annot_city": "['Milwaukee']"}, {"id": 8952, "city": null, "url": "https://www.cbs58.com/news/disheartened-city-leaders-discuss-homicides-in-milwaukee-in-2020-plans-for-2021", "text": "'Disheartened': City leaders discuss homicides in Milwaukee in 2020, plans for 2021\n\nMILWAUKEE (CBS 58) -- Debra Gillispie knows what it's like to lose someone to gun violence.

He says a lot of that work will be going into expansion into work on the south side. He says there's also more collaboration being done around data.\n\n\"That's one of the huge efforts I know the Office of Violence Prevention is diving into right now,\" he said.\n\nHe says expanding will allow 414Life to build networks and to hire more outreach workers and violence interrupters.\n\n\"One of the biggest things in expanding the team, we have the opportunity as well to work with more individuals who are considered to be high-risk, people who have been shot before, people who have been involved in violent incidents in the past, and build relationships with them where we can provide more resources to them, more support, more treatment.\"\n\nMayor Barrett says they've also been working with Employ Milwaukee to crate more jobs for young people during the summer in 2021.\n\n\"We're coming at that with renewed enthusiasm because I think the more you can create hope and opportunity through the lives of our young people through jobs, the better everybody is. They're better off, society's better off, the people who are employing them are better off,\" he said.\n\n\"Disheartened by the level of violence we've seen in Milwaukee so far this year,\" \" said Common Council President Cavalier Johnson, \"I would implore individuals, whether it's a pandemic or not, when you feel like you're in a situation where you're going to inflict violence upon someone else to think about how you would feel if somebody was looking to inflict violence to someone you care about.\"\n\nJohnson says in 2020, the police department is losing 60 officers because of attrition and in 20201, the city is scheduled to lose 150 officers. That number could be as low as 120, if the Common Council approves a federal grant.\n\nHe in the future, the City is in a situation where they will have to continually cut police officer positions because it can't afford them. He says it would be helpful if the state would give the city some additional tools.\n\n\"Like being able to raise a tax that could capture some of the spending from people who are visiting Milwaukee , whether they are visitors or commuters that virtually every other large City in America has, that could help us out.\"\n\nHe also said the state government were to reinstitute a plan on shared revenue.\n\n\"Where shared revenue would actually be fair and they wouldn't be keeping more of the funds like they've been doing for a better part of 20 years, we could be in a different position right now,\" he said.\n\nHe says another thing that needs to be done is working to provide good paying, family supporting jobs into neighborhoods.\n\n\"When you look at the heat map where some of these violent instances are occurring it's not a surprise, really, they are in the areas in our city that have been neglected economically for a generation,\" he said, \"It's incumbent upon us as members of the Common Council and City and the region, quite frankly, to make sure people have access to family supporting jobs, whether they're in the City of Milwaukee or supporting initiatives like a regional transit authority to get them from where they are to family supporting jobs, no matter where they are in our general location.\"", "title": "'Disheartened': City leaders discuss homicides in Milwaukee in 2020, plans for 2021", "dataset": "['manual_google_by_location']", "labels": "['crime']", "annot_city": "['Milwaukee']"}, {"id": 8953, "city": null, "url": "https://wtmj.com/homepage-showcase/2020/12/07/three-fatal-shootings-and-fatal-crash-highlight-milwaukees-deadly-weekend/", "text": "MILWAUKEE \u2014 A 17-year-old, 24-year-old, and a 33-year-old all shot and killed in seperate shootings this weekend in Milwaukee.\n\nAccording to MPD, the teenager was shot and killed at a party in her home, and the 24-year-old was killed in the Third Ward while walking home from the bars.\n\nThe latest casualty is a 33-year-old man that was shot to death near Holton and Keefe, just before midnight Sunday.\n\nPolice are still searching for suspects in all three shootings, and investigations are ongoing.", "title": "Three fatal shootings, two fatal crashes highlight Milwaukee\u2019s deadly weekend", "dataset": "['manual_google_by_location']", "labels": "['crime_incident', 'indirect_city_relation']", "annot_city": "['Milwaukee']"}, {"id": 8954, "city": null, "url": "https://patch.com/rhode-island/providence/city-providence-begin-youth-meal-home-delivery-distribution", "text": "PROVIDENCE, RI \u2013 Mayor Jorge O.

Hazard asked him to help jump-start her friend\u2019s car, which had broken down on the corner of Wickenden Street and Hope Street. Shortly after he arrived, a police officer drove by, parked and stood next to Bruce as he tried to jump the car, Bruce said.\n\nAccording to Bruce, after he questioned why the officer was there and if the officer voted for President Donald Trump, more police officers arrived. While one officer attempted to help restart the car, the others were just \u201cstanding around doing nothing,\u201d Bruce said.\n\nThe police officers told Bruce and Hazard that their cars, which were parked in one lane of a two-lane road, were going to be towed, Bruce said. According to a press release from the PPD, the vehicles were parked \u201cin the middle of the outbound traffic lane,\u201d and \u201cpolice proceeded to render aid and inquire if the individuals needed assistance.\u201d\n\nA back-and-forth verbal altercation between themselves and the police officers became physical leading up to the moment of their arrest, ending with police pulling Bruce to the ground and both Bruce and Hazard restrained and handcuffed, according to Bruce and Hazard\u2019s accounts of the incident, in addition to body camera footage reviewed by The Herald. In the aftermath of their arrests and the attention Bruce\u2019s video received on social media, both Bruce and Hazard are reflecting on the physical and emotional toll of the event.\n\nBody camera footage\n\nThe Providence Police Department released body camera footage of the incident in a Nov. 12 press release shared with The Herald. Although the video is edited such that the faces of the civilians are generally blurred out, Bruce and Hazard confirmed to The Herald that they were in the video.\n\nFor the first half of the footage, at least four police officers converse with the civilians, repeatedly suggesting they let the car be towed. Around the 18 minute mark of the video, the officers can be heard telling Hazard that her car will be towed because it was parked such that it faced the wrong way on the lane.\n\nWhen Hazard then gets into her car, police officers can be overheard in the footage telling her that if she moved her car, she would be arrested. The officers and Hazard and Bruce argue about their interactions earlier in the night, which were not captured by the footage.\n\nDuring the conversation, 23 minutes into the video, Hazard can be heard saying, \u201cOh, he\u2019s got a hand on his gun.\u201d\n\nBruce then can be heard telling a police officer to \u201ctake your hand off your gun.\u201d\n\nA male voice, presumably belonging to the officer Bruce addressed, is heard saying: \u201cI\u2019m resting my hand on my harness. I don\u2019t want any of you guys trying to touch my firearm.\u201d\n\nTwenty-five minutes into the video, the same voice can be heard saying, \u201cIf you don\u2019t leave, you will be locked up for disturbing the peace and disorderly conduct.\u201d\n\nThroughout the video, voices presumably of officers can be heard repeatedly telling Bruce and Hazard that they were acting disorderly and asking them to leave or risk arrest.\n\n\u201cI was talking crap to the cops,\u201d Hazard later told The Herald, \u201cbut only because I didn\u2019t understand why they would tow my car.\u201d\n\nBruce can be seen briefly filming the scene as handcuffs appear in front of the body camera and a male voice presumably belonging to an officer can be heard asking, \u201cWho\u2019s going first, him or her?\u201d\n\nIn the body camera footage, Bruce backpedals away from the police, repeatedly saying, \u201cI did nothing.\u201d Three officers chase him and one brings Bruce to the ground.\n\nJust under 30 minutes into the video, the officer wearing the body camera is shown grabbing Hazard\u2019s sleeve and telling her she is under arrest.\n\nWhile Hazard is being held, a voice can be heard saying \u201cTaze him,\u201d although it is not clear who the speaker is.\n\nAfter this, the body camera recording the released footage falls to the ground, filming upwards. From this point, Hazard and the officer cannot be seen for a short period of time, although yelling can be heard. An officer later returns to pick up the camera.\n\nFollowing the arrests, an officer refers to one of the arrestees as a \u201cprisoner\u201d and calls one of them \u201cfeisty.\u201d The video ends shortly after when the tow truck arrives.\n\nBruce, Hazard and community members reflect\n\nNoting rising tensions between Hazard and the police officers, Bruce started recording, which he told The Herald made the police noticeably more aggressive.\n\nThen, Bruce said he saw an officer \u201cplace his hand on his holster.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was like \u2026 we\u2019re not even threatening you, nobody has any weapons,\u201d Bruce said.\n\nBoth Bruce and Hazard were arrested for disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. According to the PPD, these results were \u201cpursuant to police policy regarding adverse compliance.\u201d\n\nThis incident is currently under review. \u201cOur Police Department is committed to a transparent community policing strategy that builds trust with residents and responds to our community\u2019s needs,\u201d Mayor Jorge Elorza said in a press release.\n\nVideo footage taken by Bruce was posted on Bruce\u2019s Instagram, where it circulated widely among University students and others and gained around 8,600 likes to date.\n\nSamy Amkieh \u201921.5 found out about the incident on social media, as did Aida Sherif \u201922 and Zara Norman \u201922, all of whom donated to a Facebook fundraiser to help cover Bruce\u2019s legal costs.\n\nIt happened \u201cright in a place where a lot of Brown students live,\u201d Amkieh said. \u201cA friend called a friend at three in the morning because their car died \u2026 and because he didn\u2019t immediately comply with some order to stay on the sidewalk when there was literally no one in the roadway \u2026 (the police) took out handcuffs.\u201d\n\nThe incident \u201cwas just so emblematic of how policing can cause harm,\u201d Amkieh added. \u201cI don\u2019t know what harm they were preventing, but it certainly caused harm directly to (Bruce), to his family and now he has to go through legal battles. It\u2019s just one big joke of a system, and the joke\u2019s on mostly Black and brown people, mostly working class folks, because they have to bear the brunt of it.\u201d\n\nSherif was similarly bothered by \u201cthe fact that \u2026 actually no criminal activity occurred at all \u2026 (it) goes to show how aggressive the Providence Police Department is against people of color and Black people specifically.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was shocking and upsetting that it happened so close to somewhere that I consider home and somewhere I consider safe,\u201d Norman said. \u201cThis was different and that we could absolutely see (what happened), and his injuries were documented. It sort of felt like if he can\u2019t get justice when he has the highest standard of proof, then what hope is there for anyone else,\u201d she added.\n\nIn response to these allegations, PPD spokesperson Lindsay Lague wrote in an email to The Herald that \u201cthe Providence Police Department has a long standing and well known history that is based on our Community Policing Model.\u201d She declined to comment further beyond the press release.\n\nIn the wake of the arrests, Bruce and Hazard said their lives have changed.\n\nBruce, who has taken time off work, has not only had to grapple with the effects the incident has had on his mental health, but also on his physical health.\n\n\u201cIt is draining me \u2014 it\u2019s still hard to work, to walk, honestly \u2026 my shoulder was messed up, my face is still healing, my arms, my ribs still hurt \u2026 (I\u2019ve slept) three, four, hours in the last couple days,\u201d he said. \u201cI have yet to leave my house besides to pick up my police report \u2026 I don\u2019t feel safe.\u201d\n\nHazard said her daughter knows that she was arrested. Her daughter has asked her: \u201c\u2018Mommy, are the cops going to arrest you?\u2019\u201d Hazard said that her daughter was so afraid of her getting arrested again that she was not willing to leave her side. \u201cShe wouldn\u2019t get in the car until I got in the car, and she\u2019s only four years old, so that hurt.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s something I never thought in a million years that would happen to someone in my family,\u201d Kearra Harris, Bruce\u2019s sister, said. \u201cWhen I saw that video (of Bruce\u2019s arrest), I broke down because that\u2019s not right,\u201d she said. \u201cJust looking at my brother I just broke down and just wanted to hold him.\u201d\n\nAfter the arrest, Harris started the Facebook fundraiser for her brother to raise money for a lawyer. The fundraiser has gathered $1,948 to date for Bruce\u2019s legal fees.\n\nHarris added that police officers should not use as much physical force as she saw her brother experience, and that the department should \u201cdo more\u201d to prepare officers \u201cphysically and mentally for the streets.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow that I\u2019ve gone through this,\u201d Bruce said, \u201cI can\u2019t look at a cop the same now.\u201d", "title": "\u2018I don\u2019t feel safe\u2019: Local man\u2019s altercation with Providence Police prompts community outrage", "dataset": "['manual_google_by_location']", "labels": "['safety', 'police', 'indirect_city_relation']", "annot_city": "['Providence']"}, {"id": 8956, "city": null, "url": "https://www.golocalprov.com/news/providence-small-businesses-take-a-second-gut-punch-with-national-grid-tear", "text": "Providence Small Businesses Take a Second Gut Punch With National Grid Tearing Up Retail Areas\n\nIf the coronavirus, the summer riots, a recession, and now the December partial closures weren\u2019t enough, now National Grid has been blocking traffic, tearing up the street and sidewalks directly in front of dozens of retailers and small restaurants in Providence.\n\nIn an average year, the holiday season is a make or break time of survival for local retailers. This year is not an average year.\n\nFrom the southern end of South Main Street straight through to North Main, a National Grid project has blocked off almost all public parking, ripped up the streets and closed off sidewalks, and the company has installed barriers.\n\nThe impact has been nothing short of devastating for small business owners.\n\n\"This [road work] is supposed to go away soon. In the meantime, no one walked into the store today. I\u2019ve literally seen the mailman and Fed Ex man, and that's it,\" said Todd Lattimore, the owner of Found Antiques, on Tuesday. \"This is cuckoo crazy for cocoa puffs. There is literally a barrier on the sidewalk saying please use the other sidewalk \u2014 how are people supposed to get in my store?\"\n\nFor the range of businesses \u2014 clothing, restaurant and antique shops, the virus has been devastating, but the impact the government-approved construction during the holiday season and the lack of concern by National Grid has been demoralizing.\n\n\u201cEven though our state and local government is allowing them to continually rip up our street...for the gazillionth time....we are open and have secured parking for you behind our building,\u201d said Marc Streisand, the owner of the high-end clothier Marc Allen.\n\nNational Grid defends the timing of the project. \"This is a mixed neighborhood of businesses and residents. In balancing the needs of both constituencies, we worked with the City of Providence and were granted permits for daytime work in most areas and for night work where businesses would be unduly disrupted. Additionally, our traffic and parking plans are reviewed by the city,\" said the company spokesperson Jennifer Bray.\n\nView Larger +\n\nThis year has been an endless series of challenges for small businesses in Rhode Island, and independent local retailers and restaurants have taken the brunt of the challenges. Some estimates are that 50% of restaurants and independent retailers may not survive the carnage.\n\nJulianna Fonseca of Geoff's Sandwiches, told GoLocal, \u201cThey started their work in front of us \u2014 they were there for a good 4 or 5 weeks. They definitely impacted our business, with the noise and the large barriers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe heard from customers that they didn\u2019t know we were open [during that time],\u201d she said.\n\nLattimore says it has been one hit after another for small businesses. \"For us, we were closed from March until August to the public, and we were also boarded up this summer due to the protests in the city,\" he said.\n\n\"It\u2019s not good \u2014 I\u2019ve been on the street, let's see, this is my third Christmas. Mind you, I get we\u2019re in a difficult year for every business -- except for Staples, Walmart, Home Depot, Lowes, etc,\" he said.\n\n\"The first thing that really hurt, is [National Grid] cut down those trees down the street. That was really the first impact, the physical street change,\" said Lattimore, of National Grid removing three mature trees on the street in June, to opposition.\n\n\"Then came the jersey barriers \u2014 I call them barricades \u2014 it was in front of everyone. Now it\u2019s directly in front of us,\" said Lattimore.\n\n\"The only people that have come in before this have been regulars,\" said Lattimore - who is the only business open on his block. \"There is no one walking by. I usually have a rack outside, a tree, a vignette -- a chair, a bowl, something to let people know we're here.\"\n\nLattimore said his store's online component is what is enabling him to survive at this point.\n\nView Larger +\n\nNational Grid claims it cannot delay the project until after the holidays and offered no apology or compensation to the businesses impacted.\n\n\"Despite associated parking restrictions, there remains parking along the project route - parking is still available nearby in most locations,\" said Grid's Bray, but GoLocal found that for the retailers at the North Main Street portion of the project, only a half dozen parking spots remain and more than 40 have been blocked off and restricted. The restrictions have been in place for nearly two months.\n\n\"[My displays] usually get people driving by and stopping, or walking by and coming in. Now, you can't walk here. You can\u2019t park here. There\u2019s no visual signal saying we\u2019re open,\" said Lattimore.\n\n\"If this happened during a normal year, we could deal with this \u2014 but it feels like having been pushed and having your head held underwater,\" he added.\n\nThe same frustration is true for Geoff's sandwiches -- a Providence institution.\n\n\u201cThey were originally supposed to do [the work] at night, but apparently, the residents complained, and the residents won out,\u201d Fonseca said.\n\n\u201cWe always take a hit in the winter \u2014 but with COVID and with the 'pause' \u2014 we\u2019re definitely seeing a strong decrease in sales,\u201d she added.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to take it day by day to stay open as long as we can,\u201d said Fonseca.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEnjoy this post?

The newly strengthened bond between We Care Jacksonville, Volunteers in Medicine, Agape Community Health Center, Community Health Outreach, MASS Clinic, Mission House and Sulzbacher \u2014 additional partners are expected to be added later \u2014 led to the new initiative called JaxCareConnect.\n\n\"We have a long road ahead of us to ensure all our uninsured neighbors have a viable option for health care within reach,\" said Angela Strain, executive director of We Care, a volunteer coalition of medical professionals that has provided free care to the city\u2019s uninsured population since 1993. \"It is only when every neighbor has the chance to reach their full health potential without barriers that we can begin to see that Jacksonville values all people \u2026 equally. This is a cornerstone of a healthy community.\"\n\nThe $525,000 pilot project is being funded by Riverside Hospital Foundation, Baptist Health, The Community Foundation for Northeast Florida and the Jessie Ball duPont Fund. Jacksonville City Councilman Michael Boylan is preparing legislation for another $200,000: $80,000 would go to We Care for administration costs and $20,000 each would go to the other six partners to help them increase capacity.\n\nThe concept is a \"great idea,\" Boylan said. \"It's something I think the city should support long term.\"\n\nJaxCareConnect will use multiple methods \"to reach the greatest number of patients in need of care,\" said Strain, who joined We Care in 2019.\n\nThose methods include diverting non-critical emergency room patients into the JaxCareConnect system, providing them with a new medical home at discharge; developing its own centralized patient intake system; and educating the community about Duval clinics that serve uninsured residents.\n\nThe group does not want to reinvent their health care infrastructure wheel, so this project \"utilizes joint resources to maximize service capacity and health care delivery,\" Strain said. \"This is the hallmark of collective impact, an organized commitment by multiple institutions to work toward a common goal for a public benefit.\"\n\nAlso, the savings from reducing uninsured patients' emergency room visits, she said, \"is critical as the rising numbers of displaced workers who have lost their employer-provided health insurance due to the COVID-19 crisis may overwhelm local resources during the recovery period and beyond.\n\n\"Too often, people in our community rely on emergency departments for basic primary care,\" said Brett McClung, president and CEO of Baptist Health. \u201cBaptist Health has steadfastly supported the development of JaxCareConnect. It creates a network of our local free and charitable clinics, which makes it easier for community members without sufficient insurance to access the primary care they need.\"\n\nJennifer Ryan, CEO of Volunteers in Medicine, said the Baptist Health-convened group reached a clear consensus.\n\n\"We met for over one year to discuss gaps in health care in our community, what the community needs, what is working well in our community and what needs work,\" she said. \"There was an overwhelming need for members of the community to know about their health care options \u2014 too many people were using the emergency rooms for primary care.\"\n\nEach organization also wanted to \"maintain their identity and mission\" but recognized that patient needs \"are the same no matter which clinic they go to,\" she said. And they all needed help getting the word out about their services.\n\n\"We need one place people can go to get linked to each of our services,\" said Ryan, who joined Volunteers in Medicine in 2018. \"This has set us up to add other organizations that can help with barriers to access to care like housing, transportation, food insecurity, infant mortality.\"\n\nFounded in 2003, Volunteers in Medicine has about 230 volunteers that annually provide about $1.2 million worth of primary and specialty care, dental and eye care, mental health and nutritional counseling, among other services.\n\n\"We have room to serve more,\" Ryan said. \"If our community isn\u2019t healthy, our quality of life will suffer. We are so excited to be a part of the solution. \u2026 These are our neighbors, this is our community. This process has taught me that with a shared vision and common goal anything is possible.\"\n\nThe pilot project's new centralized intake system will be key: Residents or their referral agencies will fill out one common online application, including demographic information and health care needs. Patient health advocates will explain available options to them, such as insurance eligibility and resources to help improve chronic and complex health care issues. In-person and phone appointments will also be available.\n\n\"Advocates will help patients locate the right safety net clinic for their needs and geography, acquiring transportation when needed and resourcing other supports for overcoming barriers to care,\" Strain said. \"The collaborative clinic partners are geographically dispersed and there are clinic hours seven days week.\"\n\nThe central intake process \"will help patients get the care that they need quickly,\" Ryan said. \"If someone doesn\u2019t qualify for our services, we are excited that there is a formal way to refer them directly to the services they need. The people we serve don\u2019t have time to drive around from clinic to clinic to see if they qualify. They need a simple way to get to the care they require.\"\n\nTo divert non-critical emergency room patients to primary care, JaxCareConnect will build relationships with hospital social workers and discharge staff, who already make follow-up appointments for uninsured patients with complex health issues and make calls to safety-net clinics. JaxCareConnect will also use such relationships with hospital and service agencies to help educate the community, as well as having public meetings, distributing print literature and working with the media, among other things.\n\n\"Persons without insurance will only utilize free and reduced-income clinics if they understand the mechanisms for accessing health care and trust the resources available,\" Strain said.\n\nWith We Care serving as fiscal agent handling funding and staffing, the project hired its first staffer Nov. 6. Jenny O\u2019Donnell, JaxCareConnect administrator, has 20 years experience as a nonprofit manager, including stints for the United Way of Northeast Florida, the former volunteer agency HandsOn Jacksonville and Episcopal Children\u2019s Services\u2019 Head Start Program.\n\n\"Her enthusiasm, drive and collaborative work will bring strength to the work the collaborative has already started,\" Ryan said.\n\nFor more information contact We Care Jacksonville at (904) 674-6450 or go to wecarejacksonville.org.\n\nBeth Reese Cravey: bcravey@jacksonville.com", "title": "Jacksonville nonprofits hope to connect more uninsured residents to primary care", "dataset": "['manual_google_by_location']", "labels": "['philanthropy', 'health']", "annot_city": "['Jacksonville']"}, {"id": 8962, "city": null, "url": "https://www.fox13now.com/news/local-news/sin-lake-city-slcs-wholesome-reputation-takes-hit", "text": "SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 Salt Lake City's nationwide reputation as one of the most wholesome cities in the U.S. has taken a hit in a new survey.\n\nWalletHub's list of Most Sinful Cities in America ranks Salt Lake City in 78th position, which sounds pretty good... until you realize that over 180 U.S. cities were ranked overall!\n\nIn fact, SLC ranked fairly high, No. 26, in the \"Vanity\" category in which the study measures tanning salons per capita and Google searches for \"Top 3 Plastic Surgeries.\"\n\nREAD: Salt Lake City ranks high for singles\n\nUtah's state capital also ranked well above the rest of the country in the \"Jealousy\" category where thefts per 1,000 residents, identity theft and fraud complaints placed Salt Lake City in the 22nd position.\n\nSalt Lake City was middle of the pack in other categories:\n\nAnger & Hatred: 71\n\nExcesses & Vices: 149\n\nGreed: 167\n\nLust: 43\n\nLaziness: 180\n\nIf you were wondering, the \"Lust\" category weighs a city's adult entertainment establishments per capita, Google searches for x-rated material, most active Tinder users and teen birth weight.

A new University of Utah study shows a link between peak pollution days and low student test scores in third graders in Salt Lake County. The sunrise illuminates the peaks of the Oquirrh Mountains as a the inversion blankets the Salt Lake Valley in Salt Lake City, Utah Monday, December 16, 2013.\n\nWinter inversions in the Salt Lake Valley are doing more than harming kids\u2019 lungs. Recent research found spikes in air pollution may also impact their performance at school.\n\nHeaps of scientific studies have connected chronic exposure to fine particulate matter to poor cognition , including in children . But a team of University of Utah scientists looked to the Wasatch Front\u2019s unique pollution problem \u2014 periods of stagnant air that cause muck to build up, peak, then dissipate when a storm moves in.\n\nThe study looked at third graders\u2019 standardized English and math test scores in Salt Lake County from the 2016-2017 school year. The scientists compared underperforming scores with the worst inversion days, when fine particulate, or PM2.5, was in the 95th percentile for the year. The results showed that lower scores were linked with bad pollution days for all 156 of the county\u2019s primary public schools.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t say definitively that something was a causation, but there absolutely is an association with the statics that we ran,\u201d said the study\u2019s lead author Casey Mullen, a doctoral student in sociology, in an interview.\n\nThe researchers selected third graders because they\u2019re in a critical age of brain development and are more sensitive to health effects of air pollution.\n\nThey also controlled for students facing social and economic disadvantages, meaning that all children are vulnerable to educational challenges when the valley\u2019s pollution is at its worst, regardless of their race, cultural background, where they live or their family\u2019s wealth.\n\nInterestingly, social disadvantage controls did not show a correlation between lower test scores when kids are exposed to chronic pollution, when bad air quality levels remain steady. Sara Grineski, a professor in the U. Department of Sociology and a co-author of the study, said that\u2019s because social inequality overlaps so tightly with areas of the county experiencing long-term air pollution, particularly on the Salt Lake Valley\u2019s west side.\n\n\u201cHere, we can\u2019t disentangle the effects of school disadvantage ... from the effects of chronic air pollution because they\u2019re happening in the same places,\u201d Grineski said.\n\n\u201cWe decided to look at peak exposure because it\u2019s locally relevant and it has been underexamined\u201d in other air quality research, Grineski said. \u201cIt allows us to use Utah, and do policy-relevant work in Utah, while also speaking to the broader research community that\u2019s focused on these issues.\u201d\n\nThe results further highlight the need for lawmakers to fund air quality solutions in schools, including air filters in classrooms, experts say.\n\n\u201cFor whatever reason, a lot of our lawmakers \u2014 who are the ones who need this information \u2014 seem to be persuaded by local research,\u201d said Brian Moench with Utah Physicians for a Health Environment, who reviewed the study but did not contribute to it. \u201cThis kind of research is very consistent with literally hundreds of other studies, so this is not a surprise. But it\u2019s nice to see the [same] conclusions drawn by other studies.\u201d\n\nSome fine particulates can embed in organs like the brain and remain in the body indefinitely, Moench added, harming children irreversibly.\n\n\u201cIf a kid arrives at school having inhaled air pollution, he arrives at school with an inflammatory state in [his] brain.

Legislators could prohibit school districts from building in areas prone to high levels of pollution, retrofit buses and design cities so kids have better routes to schools. They could also make science-informed decisions to update the state\u2019s air quality regulations.\n\nLast month, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency declared the Wasatch Front \u201cin attainment\u201d for particulate pollution , and will likely end its oversight over Utah\u2019s air quality improvement efforts.\n\nBut environmental advocates have accused the EPA of cherry-picking data to reach that conclusion. Other public health experts and scientists have urged regulators to make pollution thresholds stricter.\n\n\u201cWe would definitely advocate for that,\u201d Mullen said.\n\nEPA has deemed 35 micrograms per cubic meter of fine particulate its standard for nonattainment.

The bills, which were unanimously approved by the council, put Nashville on track to transition to using 100 percent renewable energy, make Metro\u2019s vehicle fleet 100 percent electric and adopt new green building standards for Metro buildings.\n\nA little more than a year later, Mayor John Cooper\u2019s office has made two announcements that bring the city closer to the future those bills envisioned.\n\nThe first is the mayor\u2019s signature of legislation updating Metro\u2019s building codes and energy standards, which hadn\u2019t been changed since 2012. The bill advanced by the administration had 15 co-sponsors on the council.\n\n\u201cOur homes \u2014 just like Nashville itself \u2014 require investments and modernized standards to operate more efficiently and more cost-effectively,\u201d Cooper said in an announcement from his office. \u201cWhen those improvements not only lower home energy costs, but also reduce the city\u2019s carbon footprint and further protect homeowners, it makes even more sense to adopt them.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Connell, who notes that District 17 Councilmember Colby Sledge largely drove the council conversation on building codes, says the updates are a big deal.\n\n\u201cMy expectation is that what you\u2019re going to see going forward after 2020 as Nashville continues to grow is that new buildings are going to be both more durable and more cost-effective for anybody who owns them and/or lives in them,\u201d O\u2019Connell says.\n\nIn announcing the new standards, the mayor\u2019s office emphasized that \u201clower-income residents are more vulnerable to higher utility costs that result from inefficient building standards.\u201d\n\nA second announcement days later detailed a partnership with Nashville Electric Service, the Tennessee Valley Authority and Vanderbilt University to construct 100 megawatts of utility-scale solar power. That project will put Metro more than one-third of the way toward being sourced with 100 percent renewable energy, according to the mayor\u2019s office \u2014 ahead of the schedule created by O\u2019Connell\u2019s 2019 legislation. It will also allow Vanderbilt to reach its own 100 percent renewable-energy goal.\n\nIn the meantime, the 100 megawatts of solar power will produce \u201cthe clean-electricity equivalent of carbon emissions from powering over 11,000 homes, or removing more than 14,000 cars from the road, every year for the 20-year term\u201d of the agreement.\n\nO\u2019Connell says the TVA has not historically been leading the way when it comes to development of renewable energy resources, although the federally owned corporation does have a modest green energy portfolio. He points to the influx of large technology companies looking to build data facilities in Tennessee \u2014 and power them with solar farms \u2014 as a major factor in the TVA\u2019s increased cooperation with solar energy efforts.\n\nPut together, the two initiatives \u2014 updated building codes and investment in solar power \u2014 begin to change Nashville\u2019s energy use from both sides.\n\n\u201cWe hope in some ways that we\u2019re reducing demand for fossil fuels, coal in particular,\u201d says O\u2019Connell. \u201cBut we also hope that we\u2019re changing the way that we produce energy in the first place.

But recent years brought problems to the plant, as age, mechanical failures and ever-changing energy market forces aligned to cause the plant\u2019s operator to threaten permanent closure.\n\nNow, after years of debate, the incinerators will shut off for good. The head of the Materials Innovation and Recycling Authority (MIRA) announced last week that the Hartford \u201cwaste to energy\u201d plant will close, at the latest, by July 1, 2022.\n\nEarlier this year, MIRA\u2019s board took the initial vote to close the plant and transform the location into a transfer station.\n\nTom Kirk, president and CEO of MIRA, which runs the plant, said the decision to close in July 2022 comes after the quasi-public organization terminated a redevelopment agreement when a number of financing options, including state subsidies and energy credits, fell through.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very significant change in the way we\u2019re handling our waste,\u201d Kirk said. \u201cWe\u2019ve landfilled almost none of our garbage for 30-plus years. To now be stepping backwards to a landfill-dependent solution \u2026 putting it in other states, is a disappointing development.\u201d\n\nMIRA carries contracts with 51 towns. Fifty of those contracts extend through 2027, which means that if the waste-to-energy plant is no longer operational, MIRA will have to figure out what to do with that trash.\n\nAnd it\u2019s a lot of trash. Between 600,000 and 720,000 tons of garbage goes to the MIRA plant in Hartford each year.\n\nKirk said the only available solution will be to transform the plant into a transfer station and send the trash to landfills. He said he\u2019s confident that a revamped transfer station in Hartford could handle the large volumes of trash without burning it.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be able to handle a good portion -- not 100 percent -- but a good portion of our customer waste, and the remaining waste will be picked up by private-sector transfer operations,\u201d Kirk said.\n\n\u201cAll of the waste will end up going out of state because there is no capacity here in Connecticut to handle it,\u201d he said.\n\nKirk said towns will have the option \u201cto exit if the price becomes uncompetitive.\u201d\n\nStaring Into The Barrel: Connecticut\u2019s 'Waste Crisis'\n\nWhen you roll your trash barrel to the curb, that trash, be it a half-eaten bagel or the detritus of a recent home cleaning frenzy, finds its way into a changing and often invisible waste economy.\n\n\u201cConnecticut is facing a waste crisis at this moment,\u201d said Katie Dykes, commissioner of the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. \u201cA lot of the traditional options that our state has relied on for disposing of municipal solid waste over the years are beginning to diminish. And they\u2019re becoming more costly or unavailable.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe MIRA facility in Hartford is kind of emblematic of those trends,\u201d Dykes said.\n\nMIRA had previously asked for $330 million to help redevelop the plant in collaboration with Sacyr Rooney, a Spanish-U.S. consortium. In late 2017, that company won a state-initiated bidding process to redevelop the plant.\n\nMIRA argued the subsidies were necessary to balance out otherwise unsustainable fees that the developer proposed as a way to finance the redevelopment plan.\n\nBut in July, Dykes wrote a critical letter rejecting that request, calling the plan\u2019s ballooning costs and request for public subsidies \u201ca bad deal for taxpayers across the state, Hartford residents, and the environment.\"\n\nWith the redevelopment now dead, Dykes said the DEEP is working with more than 70 towns across the state to reduce overall waste streams and scale up materials management.\n\nThe panel is investigating ideas like \u201cpay as you throw\u201d and recycling more food waste.\n\n\u201cWhen we surveyed all of the 74 towns that joined into this coalition earlier this year, the solution that folks were the most interested in is collection of organic waste, including food scraps and yard waste,\u201d Dykes said.\n\nReducing waste streams has become critical for many towns, Dykes said, which fear rising municipal budgets will only get bigger if they have to send trash to out-of-state landfills.\n\n\u201cIncreasing costs really pinching municipal budgets have really gotten a lot of folks to look at this as a priority,\u201d Dykes said.\n\nThe often arcane world of state bureaucracy has hosted many of these discussions. Letters, committee meetings, and pointedly-worded media releases have all been a forum for back-and-forths about Connecticut\u2019s trash future.\n\nDykes said the state wants to do more to educate the wider, trash-creating public about the magnitude of the crisis.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure that we\u2019ve seen the average citizen understanding this crisis yet,\u201d she said.\n\nThe decision decades ago to build around half a dozen waste-to-energy facilities did help the state to transition away from landfilling trash in Connecticut. An annual report from MIRA\u2019s previous incarnation, the Connecticut Resources and Recovery Authority (CRRA), estimated that in 1992, the electricity produced at the plant was equivalent to burning 700,000 barrels of oil per year, according to the state office of legislative research.\n\nBut in recent years, domestic fracking has made natural gas a lot cheaper. State and federal energy subsidies turned more and more toward renewables like solar and wind. And the model of burning trash, while once held up as an innovative form of waste management, increasingly began to struggle to find its place.\n\nKirk said those market shifts meant his plant began to get a lot less money for the power it was producing. In response, MIRA raised so-called \u201ctipping fees,\u201d which are charges to dump waste at the plant.\n\n\u201cOur price has risen to the point where it -- probably -- is pushing some of our more price-conscious customers to other locations, other disposal locations,\u201d Kirk said.\n\nThen came mechanical failures.\n\nIn 2017, two turbines at the plant failed, causing tons of trash to pile up at the facility. The plant was offline for months.\n\nKirk said the MIRA plant is now in a position where it is being managed to \u201ca safe and reasonable shutdown.\u201d\n\nBut he said if something major breaks again, that shutdown could come sooner than the projected year and a half.\n\n\u201cIf something like that were to happen next week, it\u2019s likely we would not invest the funds to repair the turbine or whatever major component failed,\u201d Kirk said.\n\n\u201cWe would accelerate the shutdown and move to a transfer mode sooner,\u201d he said. \u201cBut right now our plan is the end of the fiscal year 2022.

But city relief hasn't come for months, with little to no explanation for some who applied.\n\nKrista Vessell has been trying to make ends meet since March.\n\nShe left her job as a bank teller after suffering a nervous breakdown that she says stemmed from long work hours, family responsibilities, and added stress, and fear, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nVessell decided to home school her children after they fell behind when classes moved to remote learning earlier this year.\n\nDue to complications with her former employer and the state unemployment office, she is not able to claim any unemployment benefits.\n\nHer husband -- who has a disability -- is also unemployed.\n\nWhile his monthly disability check is barely keeping the family afloat, it can't cover all their expenses.\n\n\"Once I heard that they [the city] were going to be opening up the Hardship Relief Fund to help people with rent, I was like 'Oh, that's exactly what we need right now.'\"\n\nApplying for relief\n\nOn May 18th, the city's Household Hardship Relief Fund was launched to help families like the Vessells, those greatly impacted financially by the pandemic.\n\nThe city relied on Aloha United Way, Helping Hands Hawai\u02bbi, and the Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement to administer the fund's $25 million in CARES Act aid. When the program was first launched, it aimed to provide up to $1,000 a month for rent and utilities, and another $500 for childcare.\n\nThe program covers up to six months of expenses for those who qualified.\n\nBut Vessell says when she inquired about the program through the Aloha United Way's 2-1-1 on May 19th, she didn't hear back until almost a month later.\n\n\"Honolulu Habitat (for Humanity) actually sent me an email with a Google form application to complete,\" she said.\n\nVessell says she completed the form, with the necessary documents and provided additional paycheck stubs to demonstrate her family's financial hardship. After several days of silence, she reached out to Honolulu Habitat for Humanity to ensure they received her application.\n\n\"I was told, by the caseworker who was assigned to us, that she couldn't access any of the documents I had sent in my email,\" Vessell said. \"So I forwarded them again.\"\n\nVessell says she received an email from the caseworker a week later, requesting her to again complete the application and send the necessary documents. She, again, filled out the application and submitted them.\n\n\"On June 30, I got another email, requesting that info sheet be filled out again,\" she said. \"So I just asked her, 'Why? From the 12th to the 30th, I've sent this in two times and I'm being asked to send it again.'\n\n\"She said, 'Okay, I got it.' And she needed updated bank statements to submit.\"\n\nVessell says she finally got confirmation from Honolulu Habitat for Humanity on July 6 that her application for the month of July was submitted by Aloha United Way. She was told she would receive a confirmation call or email when the relief check was sent to her landlord.\n\n\"That didn't actually happen until September 1,\" Vessell said.\n\nThat would be the only time she would receive any confirmation that she received relief from the city's program.\n\nCity defends the program\n\nIn July, the city increased the amount qualified households could receive from $1,000 a month for rent and utilities to $2,000. It also eased certain requirements to help streamline the application process, and help more families in need.\n\nThe program was established quickly, and that presented challenges, said Becky Soon, deputy director for the city's Department of Community Services, which oversees the fund.\n\n\"We were trying to build this wa\u02bba while we're canoeing it across the ocean,\" she said. \"It did cause [delays] in every area of the technological system, to having to increase and train staff, to having to work through program requirements.\"\n\nSoon said each step in creating and operating the program came with its own challenges and barriers that needed addressing, adding to the time and delays in processing applications.\n\nThe city relied on existing programs at the Aloha United Way, Helping Hands Hawai\u02bbi and Council for Native Hawaiian Advancement as a model for the city's hardship fund. The reasoning was these organizations specialize in helping O\u02bbahu's most vulnerable and had processes and staff in place to handle what was required.\n\nBut Soon says there were still challenges in the beginning.\n\n\"The amount of documentation that the normal program process might require was going to be more than what our families could handle during this time,\" said Soon. \"And certainly more than what our system could handle.\"\n\nAccording to Soon, processing applications for the city's program could take anywhere from two to six weeks. But she did acknowledge that there have been instances when it took longer.\n\n\"A lot of it depends on the documents that have been submitted,\" she said.\n\nSoon also said delays could have been caused by the providers being unable to balance the services they normally offer and the added responsibility of the city's program.\n\nUp in the air\n\nWhile the city believes improvements have been made to the program, Vessell said she didn't see that.\n\n\"You're lucky to speak to a person,\" she said. \"I tried to call -- nothing. Voicemail's full -- can't leave any voicemails. Nobody responds to that email address.\"\n\nThroughout the fall, Vessell says she applied for relief and reached out to various organizations and people to get updates on her applications. Most of the time, she did not receive a response or didn't get any answers to her questions.\n\nShe eventually made a contact at Gregory House Programs, which is helping her through the process and giving her updates. Vessell was then pointed to the state's rent relief program, because the city's hardship fund was no longer accepting applications.\n\nVessell says there is still confusion with the state's rent relief program, and she cannot get a hold of anyone at Aloha United Way.\n\nAs of yesterday, the city has distributed $18 million of the fund's $25 million.\n\nSoon estimates $2 million is being distributed to local families a week. And she anticipates the remaining funds will be distributed before the end of the year deadline.\n\nFor Vessell, the process has left her overwhelmed, exhausted and frustrated. And after all that, she says she only wants to know one thing: Why?\n\n\"Why, when the city and state receive all this money, why wasn't it planned out to dispense it to people who need it? Why is there so much red tape to try to get help when you need help?\" she asked. \"It's not like we're people who are just milking the system here. We're people who are already struggling, and it's documented.\"\n\n\"I've always been the kind of person who, if something's not right, I'm not afraid to fight about it,\" Vessell said. \"But this year, and this in particular, I literally feel beaten down.\"\n\n\"I don't know what to do, because I've had my nervous breakdown. And almost every day I feel like I'm on the verge of it again.\"\n\nVessell says she still doesn't know if she's been awarded relief for any of the months after July.\n\nThe Aloha United Way, which administers both the city's Household Hardship Relief Fund and the state's rent relief program, declined to be interviewed for this story.", "title": "'Why Is There So Much Red Tape': Honolulu's Relief Fund Creates Anxiety And Confusion For Some", "dataset": "['manual_google_by_location']", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Honolulu']"}, {"id": 8982, "city": null, "url": "https://www.wowt.com/2020/12/07/omaha-homeowners-still-struggling-to-get-trash-collected/", "text": "OMAHA, Neb.
