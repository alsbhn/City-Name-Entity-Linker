4502,New York,https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/28/us/new-york-child-victims-act/index.html,"New York (CNN) The New York State Legislature passed a bill on Monday that will increase the statute of limitations for cases of child sexual abuse.

The Child Victims Act will allow child victims to seek prosecution against their abuser until the age of 55 in civil cases, a significant increase from the previous limit of age 23. For criminal cases, victims can seek prosecution until they turn 28. The bill also includes a one-year window during which victims of any age or time limit can come forward to prosecute.

""New York has just gone from being one of the worst states in the country to being one of the best,"" in terms of the statute of limitations for child sex abuse cases, said Marci Hamilton, CEO of Child USA and a professor at the University of Pennsylvania.

Hamilton said the bill ""represents over 15 years of work by survivors and advocates trying to get around the stiff opposition from the Catholic bishops and the insurance industry"" and is a step forward in the national conversation. There are eight other states considering similar legislation.

Survivors and supporters gather at the New York State Capitol Monday to celebrate the passage of the New York Child Victims Act.

What's the law nationally?

Many other states allow victims to sue their abusers for decades after their abuse. Oklahoma, for example, allows victims to come forward until age 45 in both civil and criminal cases.

""The fact that New York has stepped up and vastly improved its statute of limitations, it helps to pave the way for other states who haven't yet taken steps to improve their statute of limitations,"" said Stephen Forrester, director of government relations and administration at the New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.

Forrester stressed the significance of the one-year window in the bill that will allow victims of all ages and time scales to come forward. ""That's an aspect that really goes a long way at restoring justice,"" he said, and it is less common nationally. According to advocacy group Child USA, nine states have no statute of limitations for civil cases, which would allow child sex abuse victims to come forward at any point in their life -- as they will be able to during the one-year window.

New York's law will also give victims significantly more time to disclose their histories of abuse. Experts, including Forrester, say there is a need for a long statute of limitations in cases of child sexual abuse because it can take victims years to come forward. ""For many different reasons, victims need time to come forward to report their abuse,"" Forrester said. Victims can often suffer from prolonged or delayed trauma.

According to statistics from Child USA, the majority of child sexual abuse victims do not choose to disclose, if they do at all, until the average age of 52.

Child USA's Hamilton said that extending the statute of limitation for civil litigation will help expand the public knowledge of how widespread child sexual abuse is. She said it is often during civil cases that experts learn about how patterns of abuse operate.

""We have this silent pandemic in this country,"" she said. ""We didn't really understand that this was everywhere.""

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 1 in 7 children have experienced child abuse and/or neglect in the last year.

Catholic Church opposition

Monday's bill passage comes after more than a decade of opposition from the Catholic Church in New York. In a news conference on Monday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is a Roman Catholic, blamed the church directly for preventing the bill's passage.

Speaking about why the bill took years to pass, Cuomo said, ""I believe it was the conservatives in the Senate who were threatened by the Catholic Church."" The bill passed the Senate unanimously on Monday. In November 2018, Democrats took over the Republican-held Senate.

Cuomo also referenced Pope Francis, who has spoken about the Catholic Church's need to confront its history of child sexual abuse. ""I don't think I'm against the Catholic Church,"" Cuomo said, ""I think the bishops may have a different position than the Pope, and I'm with the Pope,"" he said.

New York's Catholic Conference previously opposed the bill but dropped its opposition after the bill was amended to allow prosecution of both private and public institutions.

Attorney Mitchell Garabedian has prosecuted thousands of clergy abuse cases over the past 25 years, including those stemming from the Boston Globe's investigation of the Archdiocese of Boston.

In an interview Monday, Garabedian told CNN this legislation will be hugely significant. ""I think there will be a flood of litigation,"" he said, adding that he has more than 100 cases waiting to be filed.

""It's a model for many, many states in the United States for them to follow,"" Garabedian said. In a statement, he added, ""There is now hope for justice, respect and validation for thousands of sexual abuse victims sexually abused in New York.""

Cuomo's office said he is expected to sign the bill into law soon.","New York passes Child Victims Act, allowing child sex abuse survivors to sue their abusers",auto_google,['seems_not_related_to_city'],[]

On the 46th anniversary of the landmark US ruling that made abortion legal, New York state signed into law a new abortion rights bill. Why is it so controversial?

The Reproductive Health Act (RHA) has been seen by some as a necessary move to safeguard abortion rights should the Supreme Court overturn the ruling, known as Roe v Wade.

And it comes at a time when states such as Mississippi, Iowa and Ohio are rolling back abortion provisions.

While others see it as an ""extreme"" and ""inhumane"" expansion of abortion access.

The act removes the need for a doctor to perform some abortions and takes abortion out of the criminal code, making it a public health issue.

However, the most controversial aspect of the RHA is the provision allowing abortions after 24 weeks in cases where there is an ""absence of foetal viability, or the abortion is necessary to protect the patient's life or health"".

The RHA has caused an intense and heated debate about how abortion is regulated in New York, with impassioned arguments made on each side.

We heard some of those views.

'Devastating'

In 2016, Erika Christensen was pregnant and living in New York with her husband. The couple were thrilled.

However, at 31 weeks, she found out that her pregnancy was ""nonviable"", meaning that the baby would not survive outside the womb.

Ms Christensen told the BBC that she ""didn't know about the law"" banning abortion in New York beyond 24 weeks.

""We wanted to end the suffering of this child. It was a simple choice.""

After doing some research she realised she would have to leave the state to terminate her pregnancy.

She borrowed $10,000 (Â£7,600) from her mum, and flew halfway across the country to have an abortion in Colorado.

Image copyright Erika Christensen Image caption Erika Christensen, her daughter Pepper and husband Garin Marschall in 2018

""I know I am lucky. I am middle-class and have access to those kinds of resources. But it was still really devastating.

""The laws of New York made the grieving process so much harder,"" Ms Christensen said. ""There is an inherent shame in having to leave your state to do this. It made a bad situation so much worse.""

Since then, she has campaigned for New York to change its laws on abortion.

She hopes that the RHA will help women in a similar situation to her ""work through their grief without having to fight the system"".

""These women should be able to focus on healing.""

'Time to double down'

Christina Fadden, chair of the anti-abortion organisation New York State Right to Life, told the BBC she was ""extremely saddened"" by the RHA being signed into law.

Ms Fadden said it was ""horrific"" that ""there is now no protection for unborn children in the state of New York"".

She disputes the assertion that the RHA is a necessary update to the state's law, and suggests that allowing abortions beyond 24 weeks is ""inhumane"".

Image copyright New York State Right To Life Image caption Christina Fadden speaking at the Syracuse March for Life in 2019

""I have got a fire in my belly and it's time to double down on fighting this,"" she said.

Ms Fadden is also concerned that the RHA makes abortion a ""fundamental right"" for women in New York, and will lead to ""pro-life viewpoint suppression"".

She told the BBC that her organisation has been ""overwhelmed"" by the number of people contacting them to volunteer in the wake of the RHA's ratification.

""We are still formulating our response, but we have to double our efforts.""

More on the US abortion debate

'A non-factor to the law'

While much of the discussion surrounding the RHA focuses on the 24-week provision, the removal of abortion from the criminal code is also controversial.

Pro-choice campaigners maintain that abortion is a healthcare issue, while opponents to the RHA say that it removes protection for pregnant victims of domestic abuse.

Livia Abreu was violently attacked by her boyfriend when she was 26 weeks pregnant. She was stabbed multiple times and lost her unborn baby.

Ms Abreu released a statement saying the RHA would decriminalise ""abortion as a product of an assault on a pregnant female"".

Image copyright Livia Abreu Image caption Livia Abreu is worried pregnant victims of domestic abuse will not be protected by the RHA

Her former partner is facing charges of abortion in the first and second degree, as well as attempted murder and assault.

""The passing of RHA will likely exonerate him from those charges,"" she wrote. ""Which will in turn lessen his sentence now that a judge has decided the case is going to trial and the new law will take effect prior to that date.

""Let that sink in. He will likely be convicted of the crimes he committed against me, but the loss of my daughter will be a non-factor to the law because she wasn't 'born and alive'.

""To clarify, I am neither pro-choice nor pro-life, I am very much neutral, because most things are never simply black or white.""

Supporters of the RHA suggest that there are existing laws to punish domestic abuse, and the issue should be separated from abortion.

'Groundhog day'

Merle Hoffman, who founded the Choices Women's Medical Center in New York in 1970, welcomes the change in the law, but feels it is ""overdue"".

""I have been working in this field for 48 years. It feels like I've been living in Groundhog day.""

She told the BBC that her clinic has been unable to help women in ""sad and difficult situations"" because they were more than 24 weeks pregnant.

Image copyright Choices Women's Medical Center Image caption Merle Hoffman has been providing abortions in New York since 1970

Ms Hoffman notes that many of the women who seek late-term abortions either didn't know they were pregnant for a long time, or experience complications in an originally wanted pregnancy.

""We have to get funding from various sources - often personally contributing money - to help these women access abortions services out of state.""

Ms Hoffman describes New York in the early 1970s as an ""oasis"" for women seeking abortions before Roe v Wade, and sees a parallel with the state's decision to implement the RHA.

""I can see there being a sort of 'underground railroad' of women who will come to New York now. It is another access point on the east coast.""

Ms Hoffman, is also keen to point out that only around 1% abortions in the US happen after 21 weeks.

'Options not restrictions'

Kaitlyn Marchesano, often answers the phone to people seeking financial help to terminate a pregnancy.

She works for the New York Abortion Access Fund, which supports people who are unable to pay for an abortion.

""Hearing a voice on the other end of the line going through this awful experience is challenging,"" reflects Ms Marchesano. ""The difficulty they face is heart-breaking.""

Ms Marchesano says she finds it ""incredibly frustrating"" that it is so difficult for people to access abortion later in their pregnancy.

Image copyright NYAAF Image caption Kaitlyn Marchesano works to help woman seeking abortions access funding

While abortion is covered by the Medicaid health programme in New York, she says people ""hit a funding wall"" beyond 24 weeks.

""They take on a considerable financial burden when they have to travel out of state. The cost of travel, child care, lost wages, accommodation add up on top of the cost of the procedure.""

""The human body doesn't follow a legal timeline. People need options not restrictions.""

'Grisly and gruesome'

Cardinal Timothy Dolan leads the archdioceses of New York and has been a vocal opponent to the RHA.

Speaking to Fox News, Cardinal Dolan said the new law was ""ghoulish, grisly and gruesome"", and ""not good for our country"".

New York governor Andrew Cuomo, who is a Catholic, has come under fire after signing the law, and some have called for him to be excommunicated..

4504,New York,https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/new-york-cuomo-green-new-deal-clean-energy,"New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced the launch of a ""Green New Deal"" initiative Tuesday, responding to pressure for bold climate action from progressives and clean energy advocates.

The plan, outlined in Cuomo's 2019 Justice Agenda, calls for a ""globally unprecedented"" ramp-up in renewable energy deployments as New York seeks to achieve 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2040, and ultimately to eliminate its entire carbon footprint.

âAmidst the Trump administrationâs assault on the environment and in order to continue New Yorkâs progress in the fight against climate change,"" the briefing states, ""Governor Cuomo is announcing New Yorkâs Green New Deal, a nation-leading clean energy and jobs agenda that will put the state on a path to carbon neutrality across all sectors of New Yorkâs economy.""

Former California Governor Jerry Brown signed a similar executive order last fall calling for the Golden State to achieve carbon neutrality economy-wide by 2045. California also passed legislation to achieve 100 percent clean electricity by the same year. If Cuomo's 100 percent carbon-free electricity goal is approved by the state legislature, New York will officially have the most aggressive â and legally binding â clean energy target in the country.

The cornerstone of Cuomo's Green New Deal is to boost New Yorkâs Clean Energy Standard from 50 percent to 70 percent renewable electricity by 2030. To meet this new mandate, the briefing calls for:

Nearly quadrupling New Yorkâs offshore wind target to 9,000 megawatts by 2035, up from 2,400 megawatts by 2030

Doubling distributed solar deployment to 6,000 megawatts by 2025, up from 3,000 megawatts by 2023

More than doubling new large-scale, land-based wind and solar resources through the Clean Energy Standard

Maximizing the contributions and potential of New York's existing renewable resources

Deploying 3,000 megawatts of energy storage by 2030

Gov. Cuomo also announced $1.5 billion in competitive awards to support 20 large-scale solar, wind and energy storage projects across upstate New York. These projects are expected to add 1,650 megawatts of capacity and generate enough renewable energy to power nearly 550,000 homes. All projects are expected to be operational by 2022 and create more than 2,600 short- and long-term jobs in the process.

âThe stateâs commitment to wind and solar power will attract the interest and investment we need to get projects built,"" said Anne Reynolds, executive director of the Alliance for Clean Energy New York. ""And we applaud the governorâs announcement that eight new staff members will be hired to accelerate renewable project siting and permitting.â

Vote Solar â along with a coalition of industry, environmental and clean energy advocacy partners, as well as the support of dozens of lawmakers â has been urging Gov. Cuomo for the past year to establish a goal of 1 million solar-powered homes across New York by 2023, the equivalent of the new 6,000-megawatt solar target.

""With Governor Cuomoâs commitment to 1one million solar customers, New York will put thousands to work, save millions on electric bills, and spur local economic investments and opportunity to communities all across the state,"" said Sean Garren, senior Northeast director at Vote Solar, who led the Million Solar Strong New York campaign.

""We will continue working with the administration and the legislature to meet this goal and ensure that the growing solar economy meaningfully serves all New Yorkers, including at least 100,000 low-income families,"" he continued.

To hit the 6,000-megawatt target, the Cuomo administration is expected to direct the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) to double the NY-Sun incentive program. To ensure that clean energy is affordable and accessible for low-income and underserved communities, Cuomo will also direct NYSERDA and the Department of Public Service to expand their Solar For All program and couple it with energy savings opportunities.

While elements of the plan pertaining to low- and middle-income customers will be dealt with administratively, Vote Solar said it will also work with legislative allies to get those program benefits enshrined in statute.

As for Cuomo's 100 percent carbon-free electricity goal, it will be part of the state budget, which still has to go through the legislature. Vote Solar and its partners also plan to support that effort.

That task could be made easier by the fact that Democrats took control of the New York State Legislature last election, for the first time in a decade. Growing momentum across the country around the concept of a Green New Deal, championed by New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, could also push state lawmakers to make Cuomo's clean energy goals binding.

Separate from the clean energy targets, Cuomo's Green New Deal will create New Yorkâs first statutory Climate Action Council, comprising relevant state agency leaders and other workforce, environmental justice and clean energy experts. The council will evaluate a wide range of options for making the state carbon-neutral, including the feasibility of a new multistate emissions reduction program that covers all sectors of the economy.

According to the 2019 Justice Agenda, this work is to commence immediately and align with development of the next State Energy Plan over the next two years. The briefing notes that there will be ample opportunity for public comment as the council develops New Yorkâs first carbon-neutrality roadmap.",New York Gov.

4505,New York,https://buffalonews.com/2019/01/22/long-stalled-abortion-bill-passes-new-york-legislature/,"ALBANY â New York lawmakers Tuesday authorized the most sweeping set of protections to the stateâs abortion laws in 49 years, raising emotions from advocates and opponents who descended on the state Capitol for most of the day.

The Reproductive Health Act, blocked for years when Republicans controlled the State Senate, easily passed both Democratic-controlled houses.

The measure, which Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo quickly signed into law Tuesday night, was pushed through by Democrats who now control both legislative houses. The Senate passed it 38-24. In the Assembly, it passed by a 92-47 margin.

In the face of calls at the federal level to weaken abortion rights, the bill maintains abortions as legal within 24 weeks of the start of a pregnancy â âor at any time when necessary to protect a womanâs life or health.ââ Late-term abortions had previously been authorized under state law if they meant saving the life of a woman.

The measure, which takes effect immediately, expands access to abortions by authorizing other health professionals â beyond physicians under a 1970 state law that came three years ahead of the landmark Roe v. Wade U.S. Supreme Court decision â to perform abortions.

Physician assistants will be permitted to also carry out surgical abortions and licensed midwives and nurse practitioners can do nonsurgical procedures using medications if they are âacting within his or her lawful scope of practice,"" according to the legislation.

âThe Legislature finds that comprehensive reproductive health care is a fundamental component of every individualâs health, privacy and equality,"" reads the opening sentence of the new law.

Signs and citizen lobbyists were scattered throughout the Capitol. âLate term children feel pain,"" read one sign of an anti-abortion protester. A woman nearby held up a pink sign that simply stated: âPass RHA.ââ

Roe v. Wade attacks propel new measure

Advocates say the measure is needed to protect abortion access in New York in the event the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade. Tuesday was the 46th anniversary of the landmark court ruling.

âThere are lots of bills that are in the hopper at various levels of government seeking to bring the best test case to the Supreme Court for an outright overturning of abortion. What it would do would be to revert (the issue) to the states. New York would be one of the states where a womanâs basic rights would be protected,"" said Assemblywoman Deborah Glick, a Manhattan Democrat and the billâs sponsor in the 150-member Assembly.

Glick said parts of the measure passed Tuesday were about codifying New York law with federal case law, including Roe v. Wade. Other sections, such as expanding who can perform abortions, go beyond those case laws to stake out new legal ground in New York.

In 2016, the most recent year for which statistics are available, 82,189 abortions were performed in the state. Ninety-one percent were performed in settings other than a hospital. Fifty-seven percent of those were for women between the ages of 20 and 29. Just over 1,700, or 2.3 percent, were conducted when fetuses were at or after 20 weeks old. Just over 2,800 abortions were performed in Erie and Niagara counties that year, according to state Health Department data.

To claims that the new measure will increase late-term abortions, Glick said such procedures âare generally individual tragedies. Those are wanted pregnancies that either go awry or a womanâs health is dramatically impacted."" She said women needing late-term abortions often needed to travel to other states because abortions conducted after the 24th week other than to save a womanâs life was a criminal penalty.

But critics, led chiefly by Republicans in the Legislature, say the measure will lead to more abortions in New York, especially later in a pregnancy.

âThe proponents have been saying this is merely a codification of Roe v. Wade. Itâs a far more dramatic expansion of abortion,"" said State Sen. Chris Jacobs, a Buffalo Republican. ""It will make it much easier for late term abortions and partial birth abortions.""

Jacobs said New Yorkâs longtime statute permitting legal abortions until the 24th week of a pregnancy is already among the longest in the world, and that the new provision allowing later term abortions for also the âhealthâ of the mother can be interpreted as mental or emotional conditions.

âI feel as though theyâre using the fear of the Supreme Court doing something as a ability to dramatically expand abortions rights in this state. I believe even pro-choice people, if they knew what was in this bill, would not be supportive of it,"" the lawmaker added.

A generationsâ old fight plays out

In his State of the State in 1970, then-Gov. Nelson Rockefeller, a Republican, called the stateâs abortion laws âarchaic."" Still on the books was an 1830 statute that permitted abortions â at any time during a pregnancy â if the motherâs life was in danger.

âI urge your humble bodies to resolve the differences of the past and to give favorable action to much-needed legislation on abortions reforms,"" Rockefeller told lawmakers.

Later that session, New York made national headlines and joined a movement by a handful of other states in making abortion legal. Three years later, the Supreme Court OK'd abortion.

Last week, Cuomo proposed taking the Reproductive Health Act a step further: putting abortion protections into the state constitution. âLetâs write the rights of Roe v. Wade into the state constitution so it can never be changed. No matter what happens politically,"" Cuomo said in his State of the State speech.

In 1970, like now, a leading voice against the abortion efforts was the Catholic Church, which in 1970 characterized the abortion bill as âtragic."" Last week, bishops in New York, acknowledging they had lost another abortion fight in Albany, said the new measure âwill expand our stateâs already radically permissive (abortion) law.ââ

Senate Democratic takeover pushes bill to passage

The path to passage of the RHA began in earnest in the Assembly in 2006. Republicans in control of the Senate reliably blocked the measure over the years. The GOP dominance ended with decisive defeats at the hands of Democrats in November.

Pink â via scarves, ties and jackets â was the color of the day for many lawmakers, who returned to Albany after a long weekend to pass a bill whose outcome had little drama given that both houses already committed to approving it early in the new 2019 session.

Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, a Westchester Democrat, recalled how she introduced the abortion measure in 2007. She said the idea was called âcrazyâ and a âsolution seeking a problemâ because no one really thought Roe v. Wade could be overturned.

Now, with a conservative majority on the Supreme Courtâs bench and with Trump vowing to fight to undo some abortion rights, she said Tuesday that efforts to undo Roe v. Wade in Washington and elsewhere are real.

âToday, in New York, we are saying no. Not here in New York. And weâre not just saying no. Weâre saying here in New York womenâs health matters,"" she said at the Capitol in a rare joint press conference between Senate Democrats and their fellow Democrats in the Assembly.

Senate Republicans, though, warned that the new measure will have dangerous consequences. They said the legislation repeals criminal code language regarding illegal abortions. They brought a woman to the Capitol from the Bronx who was attacked last year by her then-boyfriend; the multiple stabbing killed the 26-week-old fetus she was carrying and the man was charged with committing an illegal abortion.

State Sen. Catharine Young, an Olean Republican, said taking the illegal abortion language out of the penal code is âan assault on a womanâs fundamental right to pregnancy."" They sought, and lost, to get an amendment for specific criminal charges against individuals whose actions result in miscarriage.

During the Senate debate, State Sen. Andrew Lanza, a Staten Island Republican, said the new measure will treat someone who punches a woman who is not pregnant in the stomach âprecisely the same under our penal code as punching a pregnant woman with the intent of ending her pregnancy and in fact doing so.â

âI have to disagree with my colleague,ââ said State Sen. Liz Krueger, a Manhattan Democrat and the billâs sponsor in the Senate. She said other criminal penalties, such as first degree assault, provide prosecutors with tools to seek far longer prison sentences against domestic violence attackers, for instance, than the expiring abortion language in the criminal law.

âWe donât disadvantage any women â¦ by changing our laws but we do protect a far greater number of women to get, without discrimination, the health care services when they need them,ââ Krueger said to Lanza.

âThere is nothing radical about this bill. The decision about whether to have an abortion is deeply personal,"" she said, adding that government should not play a role in those decisions. Krueger said New York law failed to meet the standards of Roe v. Wade and it was time to redo âantiquatedâ abortion laws.

State Sen. Rob Ortt, a North Tonawanda Republican, said Democratsâ claims that the RHA bill is needed because of attacks by Trump on Roe v. Wade is âdisingenuous at bestâ because the measure has been kicking around Albany long before Trump became president. âThe reality is this bill clearly defines â¦ that we simply do not place any value, legally speaking, on the life of the unborn child,ââ he said.

Lawmakers push expanded contraceptive insurance coverage

The Reproductive Health Act was accompanied by two other pieces of legislation. First, health insurance policies would be required to cover all FDA-approved contraceptive drugs and devices, as well as voluntary sterilization procedures. Supporters said it will reduce unintended pregnancies, and includes maintaining an existing âconscience protectionâ for religious employers to opt out of having to offer contraceptive coverage in their employee health plans.

An additional part of Tuesdayâs package bans discrimination based on an employee or a dependentâs reproductive health decision-making. It bans an employer from accessing information about a workerâs decision to have an abortion without written permission from the employee. It also permits civil actions against employers who violate the billâs provisions.

The New York Health Plan Association, which represents 26 managed health care plans in the state, said insurers already provide an array of contraceptive options through the federal Affordable Care Act. But the new measure greatly expands coverage and will add to insurance costs for employers and consumers.

Democrats hailed the day. âItâs another barrier-breaking day in New York,"" Stewart-Cousins, the new Senate majority leader, added.

The senator cautioned that lawmakers âby no meansâ believe important decisions about whether to undergo an abortion âare to be taken lightly.â

âWe need to get out of the way and let people make those choices,ââ Stewart-Cousins said.

Stewart-Cousins said the abortion measure is just one outcome of the Democratic takeover of the Senate, which will soon see new laws on everything from immigration to marijuana legalization in some way.

A hedge fund billionaire has purchased a Central Park penthouse apartment for $238 million â the most anyone has ever paid for a home in the United States.

The sale, which closed Wednesday, was confirmed by a spokesman for the buyer, Kenneth Griffin.

The newly emboldened Democratic-led New York State Legislature waded into the battle over immigrantsâ rights on Wednesday, approving a bill that for the first time offers undocumented students access to state financial aid and scholarships for higher education.

Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has confirmed he will sign the measure into law.

The Dream Act is the latest in a wave of state-level protections for immigrants as blue state legislatures increasingly seek to act as a counterbalance to President Trumpâs federal immigration policies. These issues are also expected to play a prominent role in the Democratic Partyâs 2020 presidential primary, with candidates who are courting liberal activists supporting the state measures.

After New York Democrats won control of the State Senate in November for the first time in a decade, protections for immigrants became a legislative priority. They included permitting undocumented residents to obtain state driverâs licenses and reducing maximum jail sentences for certain misdemeanors that could otherwise lead to deportation.

âIt took us almost a decade to get the Dream Act, and itâs going to take another five, 10, 20 years to undo the damage that Washington is causing our families,â said Assemblywoman Catalina Cruz of Queens, who was born in Colombia and came to New York as an undocumented child.","Dream Act Is Approved in N.Y. to Aid Undocumented Students, in Rebuke to Trump",auto_google,['not_related_to_city'],[]

The New York City ordinance challenged in the new case allows residents with so-called premises licenses to take their guns to one of seven shooting ranges within the city limits. But the ordinance forbids them to take their guns anywhere else, including second homes and shooting ranges outside the city, even when they are unloaded and locked in a container separate from ammunition.

The Supreme Courtâs new majority seems ready to continue a project begun in 2008, when the court, by a 5-to-4 vote, established an individual right to keep guns in the home for self-defense. That decision, District of Columbia v. Heller, was both revolutionary and in its way quite limited. Exactly what the Second Amendment protects has been in dispute ever since.

Justice Antonin Scaliaâs majority opinion in the Heller decision included an important limiting passage that was almost certainly the price of Justice Kennedyâs fifth vote. âNothing in our opinion,â Justice Scalia wrote, âshould be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.â

It's not health insurance; it's the city paying for direct comprehensive care for those who can't afford it or are undocumented

The $100M plan will roll out this year; NYers can access the program via the city's website or by calling 311.

New York City will begin guaranteeing comprehensive health care to every single resident regardless of someone's ability to pay or immigration status, an unprecedented plan that will protect the more than half-a-million New Yorkers currently using the ER as a primary provider, Mayor Bill de Blasio said.



It's not health insurance, his spokesman clarified after the surprise announcement on MSNBC Tuesday morning.



""This is the city paying for direct comprehensive care (not just ERs) for people who can't afford it, or can't get comprehensive Medicaid â including 300,000 undocumented New Yorkers,"" spokesman Eric Phillips tweeted.

At a press conference Tuesday, de Blasio said the plan will provide primary and specialty care, from pediatrics to OBGYN, geriatric, mental health and other services, to the city's roughly 600,000 uninsured.

The city already has the foundation for such a plan â a public health insurance option that helps get direct care to undocumented residents.

That option will be expanded, the mayor said, and supported with the addition of a new program called NYC Care. Patients who seek health coverage through NYC Care will receive a card that allows them to see a primary care doctor and seek specialty care services, de Blasio said.

Those who can afford to pay will pay for services on a sliding scale, while those who can't will receive free coverage, he noted.

New Yorkers will be able to access the program through the city's website or simply by calling 311. There will be no tax hikes to fund it, the mayor said.

""The programs will include customer-friendly call lines to help New Yorkers â regardless of their insurance â make appointments with general practitioners, cardiologists, pediatricians, gynecologists and a full spectrum of health care services,"" his office said in a release.

NYC Care is expected to launch in the Bronx this summer and be available in the other four boroughs in 2021, the release said.

It'll cost at least $100 million, accordinng to the release.

""We'll put the money in to make it work; it's going to save us money down the line,"" de Blasio said on MSNBC. ""We're already paying an exorbitant amount to pay for health care the wrong way when what we should be doing is helping them get the primary care.""



""This has never been done in the country in a comprehensive way,"" de Blasio said on MSNBC. ""Health care isn't just a right in theory, it must be a right in practice. And we're doing that here in this city.""

Primary care doctors are already scarce in many areas, according to Dr. Tamara Moise, who runs an urgent care center in East Flatbush.

4512,Los Angeles,https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/22/us/los-angeles-teachers-strike-day-6/index.html,"(CNN) The six-day Los Angeles teachers' strike ended Tuesday night after teachers and staff members threw their support behind a new agreement reached hours earlier, according to a preliminary vote tally.

The vote by members of the United Teachers Los Angeles union enables teachers to return to work on Wednesday, ending a battle that left 600,000 students in limbo.

Preliminary numbers from the vote show that ""a vast super majority"" voted yes, ending the strike, UTLA President Alex Caputo-Pearl told reporters late Tuesday.

He said the counting of the ballots will continue on Wednesday.

""It's a historic day today in Los Angeles,"" he said.

""Our members after a strike that began on Monday, January 14, are going to be heading back to school, to the students that they love and the classrooms that they love and the schools that they love and are committed to,"" he added.

The new agreement with the district includes a 6% raise, a gradual decrease in class sizes over the next few years and more counselors, librarians and nurses.

Union leaders and the Los Angeles Unified School District had struck a tentative deal around dawn Tuesday after a marathon 21-hour negotiating session, Mayor Eric Garcetti said.

""It is a historic agreement,"" the mayor, who helped mediate the dueling sides, said before Tuesday's vote. ""It gets to lower class sizes. It gets to proper support staff.""

Unified (@LASchools) January 22, 2019

Caputo-Pearl praised the more than 30,000 teachers and staff members who picketed for six days, often under cold rain.

""I'm so proud of our members, classroom teachers, counselors, nurses, librarians, psychologists,"" Caputo-Pearl said earlier Tuesday.

He made those remarks at a news conference standing next to Beutner -- a symbolic sight, considering Beutner has been the target of intense UTLA criticism for months.

While both sides gathered in harmony Tuesday, ""the strike was painful, and it had a cost,"" Garcetti said.

Thousands of teachers marched in the rain demanding more school staffing and higher salaries.

The first week of the strike cost the school district more than $125 million . That's because the state of California funds schools based on daily attendance, and the number of students going to school plunged during the strike.

Some parents said they purposefully kept their kids out of school in hopes that the money drain suffered by the district would lead to a resolution more quickly.

Why so many teachers toughed it out

For the past six school days, educators hit the picket lines to demand smaller class sizes, higher salaries and more school nurses and counselors.

""We work with students every day who face trauma and face hardship,"" Garfield High School teacher Erika Huerta said. ""So we're doing this as a life passion to improve our community.""

Teachers and students who joined them on the picket lines decried class sizes of 45 or more. They said many students aren't able to get the individual attention they need to effectively learn.

So the standoff between UTLA and LAUSD came down to two issues: how much money to spend on more school staffing and teachers' raises, and whether the school district actually has that kind of money.

The union wanted the school district to pony up more money to meet its demands, but LAUSD said its $1.8 billion in reserves is already earmarked for education spending during this three-year budget cycle.

The school district agreed that schools need smaller class sizes, more staffing and bigger raises for teachers.

""The issue has always been how do we pay for it,"" Beutner said. ""We can't solve 40 years of underinvestment in public education in just one week, in just one contract.""

Firefighters and celebrities join the fight

Firefighters marched Tuesday in support of Los Angeles teachers on strike.

During their week-long strike, teachers received support from a barrage of actors musicians and politicians

On Tuesday, they got a big boost from members of the International Association of Firefighters, who are in Los Angeles for a conference this week.

Albert Shanker and the Battles Over Schools, Unions, Race and Democracy

By Richard D. Kahlenberg

552 pp. Columbia University Press. (2007)

This book highlights Albert Shanker, a union president who led teachersâ strikes in late 1960s New York City after 18 unionized white educators were fired as part of an initiative to create a black local school district in the Ocean Hill-Brownsville sector of Brooklyn. Though Shanker agreed that the teaching force needed to be diversified, he took a different approach, working to unionize teacher aides, who tended to be people of color, and negotiating a stipend for them to get their college degrees and become teachers. Shanker has since been viewed as a pioneer in teachersâ unions and educational reform.

4514,Los Angeles,https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/25727292/los-angeles-chargers-signing-nick-rose-handle-kickoff-duties,"COSTA MESA, Calif. -- The Los Angeles Chargers are signing Nick Rose to handle kickoff duties in Sunday's playoff game against the New England Patriots, a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter.

The move could help a kicking game that allowed the most returns in the NFL during the regular season.

Chargers rookie kicker Michael Badgley has been productive on field goals and extra points.

In 10 games played during the regular season, Badgley made 15 of 16 fields goals (94 percent), including a franchise-long 59 yarder in a Week 14 contest against the Cincinnati Bengals. Badgley also made 27 of 28 extra points (96.4 percent).

However, Badgley had a touchback on only 9 of his 54 kickoffs during the 2018 regular season. That 16.7 percent rate was the worst in the NFL among players with at least 10 kickoffs in 2018.

The Chargers are concerned with explosive Patriots return man Cordarrelle Patterson, who averaged 28.8 yards per return during the regular season, including one taken back for a 95-yard touchdown.

""They have one of the best kick returners that I've seen in a long time,"" Chargers head coach Anthony Lynn said this week. ""So that's going to be a heck of a challenge for our special teams. It's a good thing we have one of the better cover units in the league right now, but that's going to be a heck of a challenge.""

The Chargers did hold returners to 21.7 yards per kickoff return in the regular season, the eighth-best rate in the league.

Rose kicked in two games for the Chargers at the end of the 2017 season, making 1 of 3 field goals and 5 of 6 extra points. Rose had touchbacks on 8 of his 9 kickoffs for the Bolts last season.

Mikhail Zinshteyn/EdSource

Most of the signs and chants call for better pay, smaller classes and more staff support, but the backdrop to the Los Angeles Unified School District strike is a battle that has long loomed large over education in California: The fight over charter schools.

The countryâs second-largest public school district, which educates over 480,000 students, has seen a steady decline in enrollment and resources as the areaâs charter school enrollment has nearly doubled in the past decade.

The tensions between teachersâ unions and organizations representing charter schools have grown at a similar breakneck speed. During the last two statewide elections, each side spent tens of millions of dollars on political campaigns to back candidates for governor and state superintendent of public instruction.

How the acrimony plays out in the Los Angeles strike, the first in 30 years, will have a ripple effect in school districts across California, as many wrestle with similar issues of declining enrollment, dwindling finances and a growing number of charter schools.

Central to the concerns of teachers and union leaders at Los Angeles Unified is the argument that the growth of charter schools in the city has come at the expense of dollars for district schools and the teachers working in them.

âWe want LAUSD and the City of L.A., and the County of Los Angeles, to join us in calling for a cap on charter schools,â Alex Caputo-Pearl, president of the union representing the roughly 31,000 striking teachers in Los Angeles, said Tuesday, hours before a large rally in front of the L.A. offices of the stateâs largest charter association. âThere are too many schools in Los Angeles right now. We do not need to have the âgrow-as-fast-as-you-canâ business model thatâs promoted by charter billionaires. We need to invest in our existing schools â charter and district.â

As the United Teachers Los Angeles strike enters its third day, it is using its seat at the bargaining table to push a number of issues related to how charter schools are operated in the district. One, reforming how the district shares classroom space with charter schools, is a specific demand in the unionâs negotiations with the district. Another, capping the number of charter schools, is a policy goal that the union is keeping top-of-mind during the strike.

Key to the bitter dispute: Charter schools, which enroll about a fifth of students in Los Angeles Unified, have contributed to a loss of $600 million annually that otherwise would benefit students in district schools, according to union officials, largely because of fixed costs that canât be reduced even if there are fewer students. Charter backers have pushed back on those figures.

Enrollment in the district has been declining since 2003, when more than 700,000 students were enrolled. Just over 480,000 students occupy seats in the districtâs schools today. In addition, more than 100,000 are enrolled in independently run charter schools.

Whether charter schools can be fully blamed for the drop in enrollment in district schools is an open question.

Because districts receive state money for the number of students they enroll, union leaders say students leaving for charter schools means less money for the district to cover the kinds of expenses the striking teachers are demanding. Those include a 6.5-percent salary increase, a reduction in class sizes and more money for support staff, such as nurses and school counselors.

In the days and weeks leading up to the strike, union officials have sought changes in how traditional public schools provide space to charter schools. State law requires districts to free up unused classrooms and other facilities for charter schools.

Specific to the contract dispute, Caputo-Pearl said his union wants limits on whatâs shared to free up computer labs, dance studios and music centers that can be used by students and teachers, even if the rooms arenât used all the time.

Los Angeles Unified District officials say the unionâs charter-school demands are beyond the scope of what state law says can be discussed during negotiations.

âItâs not an appropriate subject for bargaining,â said Robert Samples, the districtâs interim director of labor relations, saying these are issues that would have to be resolved in the Legislature.

He said the district proposed forming a working group to discuss how charter and district schools can share space. The union has called that proposal inadequate.

Disputes over how charter and public schools should coexist donât seem to have a place in contract negotiations, said Pedro Noguera, a UCLA professor of education and founder of the Center for Transformation of Schools.

âIâm not sure politically what theyâre trying to gain through the strikeâ regarding charter schools, Noguera said.

If the main issue for striking teachers is more money, Noguera said, United Teachers Los Angeles is already in a stronger position thanks to newly elected Gov. Gavin Newsom.

In his first state budget proposal last week, Newsom proposed more money for K-12 education and extra dollars for school districts to pay their massive pension obligations â a growing cost pressure for districts. The budget also included more money for homelessness and mental health services, âall of which can translate into additional services and support for children served by LAUSD,â the governor said in a statement this week.

For Caputo-Pearl, though, the bigger issue is charter expansion. He thinks the show of strength this week during the strike will put pressure on state leaders to limit charter growth.

In response to questions about the strike this week, Newsom indicated that he is eager to sign legislation promoted by UTLA and other teachers unions requiring more transparency in charter school operations.

There is growing evidence that the charter sector in Los Angeles is having its own enrollment troubles, raising questions about whether there are more charter schools than there is demand.

A recent district report concluded that charter schools the district authorized are struggling to reach enrollment goals. In 2017-18, independent charter schools overseen by the district enrolled 15,882 fewer students than what the charter school operators projected. Only 34 of 224 charter schools met or exceeded their enrollment targets.

The union on Tuesday held a rally outside of the Los Angeles office of the California Charter Schools Association, the stateâs main charter school membership organization, which has received millions of dollars from wealthy donors through its political arm that it then distributes to candidates running for office.

Myrna CastrejÃ³n, president and CEO of the charter schools association, said she supports the unionâs demands for better pay and working conditions. But she added that while demand for charter schools in Los Angeles varies by neighborhood, around 16,000 students are on waitlists to get into particular charter schools in Los Angeles.

Disagreements aside, teachers in both district and charter schools should have better pay and access to more resources, Caputo-Pearl said.

One of the three Accelerated Schools charter campuses, whose teachers are also represented by United Teachers Los Angeles, joined the strike on Tuesday â the first charter school strike in California history, according to the union.

âWe actually support the original intent of charters, which was to have small efforts to innovate and then feed lessons back into the public system to try to help the overall public system,â Caputo-Pearl said. âThatâs not happening.â

Randi Weingarten, the president of the nationâs second-largest teachersâ union, with 1.7 million members, the American Federation of Teachers, on Tuesday said charter groups are trying âto divide educator against educator.â

Charter schools arenât typically unionized, though in California about 30 percent are represented by unions, according to the California Charter Schools Association.

Teachers at unionized charter schools in Los Angeles are sympathetic to the strike.

Some teachers at the Green Dot charter school network, represented by the AsociaciÃ³n de Maestros Unidos, which like UTLA is affiliated with the California Teachers Association, took paid time off to walk the picket lines with Los Angeles Unified teachers. Others made care packages at locations where Green Dot shares space with district-run schools.

âIf there are charter schools that are not meeting their enrollment, then thereâs no point in operating a school thatâs not attracting families or students,â said Angel Maldonado, president of the labor union that represents Green Dot teachers in California.

While Maldonado called the demands of striking teachers âspot on,â heâs concerned that changes to how the district shares space with charter schools could lead to lost jobs for his members.

âThat is something that would worry me,â he said, âand would worry a lot of my membership.â

This is a game that almost didn't happen. If Bears kicker Cody Parkey had been able to knock through a 43-yard field goal against the Eagles on Sunday, then the Cowboys would be headed for New Orleans this weekend and the Bears would have been playing the Rams. Instead, Parkey's kick was knocked off course by an Eagles player, sending the Bears out of the playoffs and the Cowboys to Los Angeles.

Somehow, the luck of the draw always seems to bring these two teams together in the postseason. This Saturday's game will mark the ninth time in NFL history that the Rams and Cowboys have met in the playoffs, which is notable, because no two teams have met more.

Although they haven't played each other in the playoffs since 1985, these two teams have more postseason meetings than more glamorous rivalries like 49ers-Giants and Cowboys-Packers, which have both happened seven times in NFL playoff history.

The all-time playoff series between these two teams is tied 4-4 and the team that breaks the tie on Saturday will be getting a nice prize: A trip to the NFC Championship game. If the Cowboys pull off the upset, they'll be headed to their first NFC title game since January 1996. If the Rams can pick up their first playoff win under Sean McVay, they'll be headed to the NFC Championship for the first time since January 2002.

Location: Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum

Storylines

Cowboys: To get to their first NFC title game since 1995, the Cowboys are going to have to exorcise a few postseason demons this week. For one, the Cowboys have been one of the NFL's worst road playoff teams over the past 25 years. Since 1993, the Cowboys have gone on the road seven different times for a playoff game and they've lost every single one of those games, a total that includes one loss under Jason Garrett. The Cowboys have also struggled in the divisional round of the playoffs. Since their last NFC title berth in 1995, the Cowboys have gone 0-5 in the divisional round. After 25 years of struggling, the Cowboys will be looking to change their luck this week.

Although the Cowboys should be at nearly full strength when they take the field in L.A., there are two injuries to keep an eye on. Wide receiver Cole Beasley has been dealing with an ankle injury all season and he got even more banged up during the Cowboys' win over Seattle on Saturday. There's no guarantee that Beasley will play and Jason Garrett has said that it will on come down to how Beasley feels as the week goes on. Another player dealing with an ankle injury is left guard Xavier Su'a-Filo, who didn't play against the Seahawks. Luckily for the Cowboys, it sounds like he's likely going to be on the field. Garrett said this week that he's ""optimistic"" that Su'a-Filo will play against the Rams, which would definitely be good news for a Cowboys offensive line that will be going up against Aaron Donald and Ndamukong Suh.

Rams: One of the biggest storylines in this game for the Rams will be the health of Todd Gurley. After sitting out the final two games of the regular season due to a knee injury, Gurley is expected to be on the field against the Cowboys, but it's not clear if he'll be 100 percent. Although C.J. Anderson filled in admirably while Gurley was out, averaging 149.5 yards per game, those two performances came against the Cardinals and 49ers, two teams that aren't nearly as good as the Cowboys when it comes to stopping the run. Not only did the Cowboys rank fifth in the NFL against the run in 2018, but they also completely shut down a Seahawks ground attack that finished the season as the league's top rushing team. The Rams are likely going to need a big game from Gurley if they want to advance.

What needs to happen

Cowboys: The Cowboys offensive game plan on Saturday basically boils down to two words: Feed Zeke. If the Cowboys are going to pull off the upset in Los Angeles, they're going to need a big game from Ezekiel Elliott. The good news for the Cowboys is that if there's one team they should be able to run all over, it's the Rams. Although Aaron Donald led the NFL in sacks this year with 20.5, that didn't really help the Rams when it came to stopping the run. During the regular season, the Rams surrendered 5.1 yards per carry, which was the worst performance by any defense in the NFL in 2018. When going up against a defense like that, Elliott is basically the perfect weapon to have. Not only did the Cowboys running back lead the NFL in rush yards (1,434), but he also averaged 4.7 yards per carry during the regular season. In the Cowboys wild-card win over the Seahawks, Elliott totaled 169 yards and a touchdown (137 yards and a touchdown on the ground, 32 yards through the air).

Rams: The Rams need Jared Goff to get off to a hot start so he doesn't lose any confidence. Although the Rams lit up the scoreboard during the final two weeks of the season by scoring 48 and 31 points, those games came against bad teams in the 49ers and Cardinals. In the two weeks before that, the Rams played two playoff teams -- the Bears and Eagles -- and Goff struggled big time, throwing five interceptions and zero touchdowns in two games that the Rams ended up losing. Goff also struggled in his only playoff appearance last season, a game the Rams lost to the Falcons 26-13. The Rams were limited to just 13 points against the Falcons after leading the NFL in scoring in 2017, and a big reason for that was because Goff never got on track. Aaron Donald and Todd Gurley are important players for the Rams, but they can still win if either of those guys has an off day. However, the Rams have almost no chance of winning if Goff has an ugly game.

Game prediction

Point spread: Rams, -7 points

The Rams have one glaring weakness this year -- stopping the run -- and unfortunately for L.A., the Cowboys are the one team left in the playoffs that's perfectly built to exploit that weakness. Ezekiel Elliott is probably licking his chops at the thought of going up against the Rams defense and it won't be surprising at all if he has a huge night with 150 rushing yards or more. If the Rams can jump out to a big early lead, they might be able to get the Cowboys away from their ground game, but that won't be easy. The guess here: Zeke runs wild as the Cowboys pull off the upset win.

A thrilling overtime game, the Rams beat New Orleans with timely defense, a lucky no-call, and just enough offense lead by QB Jared Goff. In the 26-23 OT thriller, the Saints put up a heck of an effort to try and get to the Super Bowl and in the end fell just short.

Although itâs hard to imagine the Saints not being contenders with QB Drew Brees and the core of Michael Thomas, Marshon Lattimore, Alvin Kamara, and so on, nothing is a given in the NFL.

QB Drew Brees

Brees had a solid game for the Saints until the last time he touched the ball in overtime. For the game, Brees completed 26/40 passes for 249 yards, two touchdowns, and the crucial interception that set up K Greg Zuerleinâs 57-yard field goal. Overall, he finished with a QB rating of 60.1 in the game.

LB Demario Davis

Davis was all over the field for the Saints. He had 14 total tackles including 1.5 tackles-for-loss. In addition, he was the beneficiary of an interception off a deflection from Rams RB Todd Gurley early in the game.

Demario Davis came up big for the #Saints on their first defensive series of the game, but he has been huge for them all year.

WR Michael Thomas

The Rams did a much better job in containing WR Thomas. He was limited to seven targets, four receptions, and 36 yards. The Rams gave him multiple looks including zone, man with a lurking LB/S, press man, and off man. In the end, Thomas was contained and the return of CB Aqib Talib definitely helped.

CB Marshon Lattimore

Lattimore was relatively busy for the defense with six total tackles. He and the rest of the secondary had their hands full as the Rams passed for over 300 yards. Itâs never a good sign to have all the cornerbacks being in the upper half of the tackle leaders for a defense as thatâs usually a sign of bigger plays. Lattimore (six), P.J. Williams (eight), and Eli Apple (four) all had a pretty high number of tackles.

The Rams defense again flexed their run-stuffing muscles limiting the Saints to only 48 yards rushing for the game. Ingram lead the Saints with 31 yards on nine carries while Kamara only rushed for 15 yards on eight carries. That being said, Kamara was the best receiver for the Saints with 96 yards receiving (with 11 receptions). In the end, the Rams did just enough to limit Kamara as a receiver and was able to make New Orleans more one dimensional than they would have liked to be.",Los Angeles Rams at New Orleans Saints 5 Saints to watch revisited,auto_google,['sport_news'],[]

The stakes for the teachersâ strike in Los Angeles were exceptionally high, not only for the local adversaries in the battle but also for the labor movement in California and nationally.

The reason: the strike came at a time when labor unions were supposedly weakened by the Supreme Courtâs decision last June in the Janus vs. AFSCME case, ruling that workers do not have to pay mandatory union fees even if a union represents them at the bargaining table.

It was a strike that United Teachers Los Angeles, representing over 30,000 teachers, had to win by delivering on the key demands they put on the table: not only higher salaries but a range of support services intended to improve working conditions and studentsâ academic outcomes.

There was widespread expectation that the Janus lawsuit â filed by several right-wing organizations on behalf of Mark Janus, a social worker in Illinois â would diminish the influence of public sector unions, especially in California, where they are powerful forces in the workplace and in state politics generally.

With less revenue, the reasoning went, unions would have less lobbying clout, a smaller war chest to contribute to political campaigns and less money to organize workers.

The strike in Los Angeles stood out at least in part because it was the largest, at least in terms of the number of workers involved, since the Supreme Courtâs Janus ruling. UTLA President Alex Caputo-Pearl acknowledged its significance at the press conference announcing the contract agreement in City Hall this week.

âObviously, this is a crucial moment for unions in the United States,â he said, at a time when âa lot of people are questioningâ their future.

The L.A. strike, Caputo-Pearl suggested, should put that issue to rest.

The strike was a declaration that public sector unions are still alive. Instead of being weakened by the Janus ruling, UTLA was able to mobilize tens of thousands of teachers and generate support from other teachers around the state in a show of statewide unity not seen in decades.

The importance of the strike was underscored by the on-the-ground presence of the leaders of the largest teacher organizations in the nation: Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, and Lily Eskelsen Garcia of the National Education Association.

As Mayor Eric Garcetti noted, the strike âwas painful and had a cost.â But it should boost the spirits of labor organizers nationally, especially teachersâ unions waging similar battles. The strike settlement came at a time when unions struggle to maintain a firm foothold in the labor market. Union membership has now reached historic lows, according to a report issued last week by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In 2018, only 6.4 percent of workers in the private sector belonged to a union.

But if there has been any bright spot, it is in the public sector, where unions are still strong, with a unionization rate five times that of the private sector. In California, those rates are much higher than national ones. About 59 percent of public sector workers in California belonged to a union last year, according to the UC Berkeley Labor Center, compared to about 34 percent nationally.

In this strike, teachers were bargaining from a position of strength. Public opinion polls show that teachers are generally respected and that most Americans think teachers are underpaid. During the strike, they enjoyed widespread support from parents and others in Los Angeles. That was strengthened by union demands for more counselors and other support staff who arguably would benefit children and their families more than teachers. The strategy appeared to be influenced, intentionally or not, by a new approach to organizing called âbargaining for the common good.â

Also UTLA currently is arguably in the strongest position it could hope to be in the wake of the Janus decision, whose longer term impact has yet to be felt. Thatâs because the union has so far been able to convince most teachers to opt into the union and pay their union fees, even though they are no longer mandatory.

But these were mostly teachers who have become accustomed to paying dues, the ones most likely to be most appreciative of the unionâs value. Over time, as newer and younger teachers come into the profession, they may not feel the same allegiance, especially as they cope with the impact of high housing costs and they make tough decisions about where and how to spend their lowly beginning teacher salaries.

Now the union must assess what it has gained and what it has lost as a result of the strike. One unfortunate outcome is that the district said it lost an estimated $125 million in state funds it would have received if students had been in school, although that amount was offset by the approximately $60 million it saved in not have to pay teacher and other salaries. The district now may be in even weaker financial shape than it was before the strike, and many questions remain as to how it will pay for everything it agreed to at the bargaining table.

But it is clear that, for now, the union is still a potent force, despite ongoing efforts to weaken it and render it irrelevant in Los Angeles and California.

4521,Los Angeles,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/28/us/charter-schools-los-angeles.html,"Charter schools, which are generally not unionized, were not officially on the bargaining table in the protracted negotiations between the union and the district. It is the state, not the school district, that crafts the laws governing charter schools and their growth. But it was always a central message of the union during the strike: Charter schools, they argued, were taking students and money away from traditional public schools.

Still, charter schools have proven popular among many parents in Los Angeles. Some schools have long waiting lists and the district already has more students enrolled in charters than any other public school system in the country.

It is still unclear how much practical impact the deal will have on charters. Charter school supporters are lobbying the school board, which has steadfastly supported charters for more than a decade, to vote down the resolution for a charter school cap this week. Even if it passes, advocates are certain to take the fight to Sacramento, where a bill calling for a moratorium seems likely. They will argue that charters have given poor students and students of color essential options for better schools.

But the defeat in the court of public opinion is clear: After years of support from powerful local and national allies â including many Democrats â charter schools are now facing a backlash and severe skepticism.

Over the past two years, charter school supporters were dealt painful political defeats in California, New York, Massachusetts, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and other states.

As the push for alternatives to traditional public schools has come to be more associated with President Trump and his secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, the shift in Democratic Party politics has been especially pronounced. President Barack Obama supported expanding high-quality charter schools, and pushed teachersâ unions to let go of some of their traditional seniority protections and put more emphasis on raising student achievement.","Success of Los Angeles Teachers Strike Rocks Charter Schools, and a Rich Supporter",auto_google,['redundant'],[]

Former Eagles kicker Cody Parkey hit the left upright and then the crossbar with a field-goal attempt from 43 yards with 10 seconds remaining, silencing the raucous crowd.

The defending league champion Eagles (10-7) squeezed into the playoffs by beating Washington and having the Bears (12-5) help them by knocking off Minnesota in the season finale. Philadelphia thanked its benefactor with a 12-play, 60-yard drive on which Foles, the Super Bowl MVP last February, hit six passes.

Philly plays at New Orleans (13-3) next Sunday.

No team has repeated as Super Bowl champion since New England in 2004, and the Eagles are a sixth seed. The last sixth seed to win the NFL title was Green Bay in the 2010 season.

But these Eagles, led by Foles and a defense down to backups at several positions, seem to have that magical touch like last season.

It was a sizzling ending to a game marked by superior defense and several critical mistakes by the Eagles. They had to survive after Tarik Cohen, an All-Pro punt returner, took back the kickoff following Philly's go-ahead score 35 yards. Mitchell Trubisky completed two passes to get the Bears close enough for Parkey. But his kick took a double deflection and fell harmlessly into the end zone.

Chicago is no stranger to corruption. More than 30 Chicago City Council members have been tied to corruption cases since the 1970âs, with Ald. Edward Burke (14) becoming the latest Chicago politician to make headlines after being charged with one count of attempted extortion on Thursday, Jan. 3 for allegedly trying to use his power on the City Council to solicit business for his private law firm.

The charge against Burke, Chicagoâs most powerful and longest-running City Council member, comes on the heels of two FBI raids carried out in his offices late last year.

After serving the cityâs Southwest Side for 50 years, the charge puts Burke on the ever-growing list of disgraced city officials.

Kelly on the Near West Side, alleging that the two-story building is being used illegally and not in compliance with its zoning designation.

City lawyers said Kellyâs recording studio inside is not allowed under the buildingâs zoning. They also alleged studio was built without a permit. Additionally, the building is being used as a residence, the city said, which is also not allowed.

âUpon information and belief it is being used as a residence and artist workspace â specifically as a recording studio in violation of the zoning law,â city attorneys said.

City attorneys said the property at 219 N. Justine âis zoned as a Planned Manufacturing District,â which means the building would have to have an industrial or commercial use.

The buildingâs owner and tenants have also failed to âarrange for inspection of the premises,â attorneys wrote.

The complaint was filed Thursday and Cook County Circuit Court Judge Patrice Ball-Reed said she would hear arguments Friday morning. Itâs unclear when she will issue a ruling.

Wednesday evening, inspectors from the cityâs Department of Buildings and an official with the Fire Department could be seen knocking on the buildingâs windows and doors in an effort to get inside, but no one answered. They also shined a flashlight inside. They declined to comment to reporters.

City attorneys are requesting Ball-Reed âauthorize the Department of Buildings to conduct a full interior inspection of the property to determine its current use, compliance with the code, and ensure safety of occupants and first responders.â

Theyâre also asking for an order against Kelly and the buildingâs owner âto correct the violations alleged in the complaint and to restrain future violations permanently.â

Midwest Commercial Funding LLC, which owns the building, and the bank that issued the mortgage were named as defendants. Kelly is not named in the filing, though other defendants were listed as âtenants & occupants.â Kelly is the only tenant.

Kellyâs attorney did not respond to a request for comment.

In an emailed statement, Midwest Commercial Funding said the company is âcommitted to cooperating with the city and providing any and all support that it needs to resolve this matter.â

The 8,000-square-foot building is currently listed for sale on several realty websites and, in at least one case, boasts of a âhigh profile tenantâ and a recording studio in the building.

Superstar being evicted

The cityâs request to inspect the building came just days after another county judge ordered Kelly be evicted from the building. Midwest Commercial Funding sued Kelly last summer, alleging he owed the company nearly $80,000 in back rent.

Monday, the judge ruled in Midwest Commercial Fundingâs favor, court records show, and awarded the company $166,981 while also issuing an âorder of possessionâ for Midwest Commercial Funding.

A spokeswoman for the Cook County Sheriffâs Office â the agency that handles evictions in the county â said the office had not yet received the judgeâs eviction order as of Thursday afternoon and it was unclear when it would be executed.

Wednesday evening, a group of about 30 people rallied outside the warehouse, chanting âblack girls matter.â A couple dozen people could be seen filing into the building. Outside, a woman stood on the sidewalk calling the protestors âliars.â

In 2017, Buzzfeed News reported that several sets of parents had told various police agencies that Kelly was holding their daughters against their will in what they called a âcult.â

4527,Chicago,https://chicago.suntimes.com/2019/1/30/18314201/persons-of-interest-in-jussie-smollett-attack-captured-on-camera-police-say,"Surveillance images released Wednesday evening by Chicago police show two âpersons of interestâ in the alleged racist and homophobic attack on âEmpireâ actor Jussie Smollett.

Police officials say detectives are looking to identify and interview the people captured on camera to find out if they were involved in the reported attack or witnessed it. Police arenât yet calling them suspects as detectives continue to investigate Tuesdayâs brutal incident as a hate crime.

The two low-quality images appear to show two people wearing all black clothing, matching the description of the attackers given to police by Smollett. Police say they were walking on New Street near Illinois Street between 1:30 a.m. and 1:45 a.m. Smollett told officers the attack happened at 2 a.m. about one block away. Not much else can be determined from the photos.

âWhile the video footage does not depict an assault, the individuals pictured are seen in the vicinity of the alleged criminal incident during the alleged time of occurrence,â said police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi. âDetectives are taking this investigation seriously and urging anyone with any information on the identity of these individuals to contact Area Central detectives.â

Though no video was released of the attack or the events leading up to it, Guglielmi said detectives have pieced together video showing the two persons of interest walking in the same direction as Smollett about the same time he was in the area.

âThey could have been the perpetrators, they could have been witnesses, they could have been complete bystanders who didnât see the incident at all,â Guglielmi said. âThere are still a lot more cameras that we have to look at. Itâs almost like a digital puzzle. You have to put all of those pieces together and kind of watch them at the same time.â

Until Wednesday evening, police had said detectives did not have enough information to release a description of the attackers despite reviewing hundreds of hours of video from the surrounding area.

Smollett was reportedly attacked around 2 a.m. Tuesday as he was walking back to an apartment after a late-night meal at a Subway restaurant at 511 N. McClurg Court, police said.

Two men indicated they recognized Smollet and yelled racist and homophobic slurs at Smollett in the 300 block of East North Lower Water Street, before they hit him in the face, poured what is suspected to be bleach on him and put a rope around his neck, Smollett told police.

After describing the attackers as men wearing ski-masks and all black clothing in an initial report filed with police, Smollett told detectives in a follow-up interview that the men yelled âthis is MAGA countryâ after they assaulted him.

Smollett was talking to his agent on the phone when the attack started, Guglielmi said. Detectives could not âindependently verifyâ that claim because neither man wanted to turn over their cell phones. But police have no reason to doubt the story, according to Guglielmi.

The manager, identified in news reports as Brandon Moore, told Variety Wednesday that he heard the racial slurs and the âMAGAâ quote.

âI heard the scuffle and I heard the racial slur,â he said.

Smollett was treated for lacerations to his face and neck at Northwestern Memorial Hospital and later released.

The block where the attack took place has parking garage entrances but no retail businesses. Police recovered video from various business, residential and police cameras in the wider area, but none until Wednesday showed any possible suspects.

More than a dozen police detectives, some specializing in hate crimes, are working the case. They asked anyone who has information or witnessed the attack to call detectives at (312) 747-8382 or submit an anonymous tip at cpdtip.com.

Congressman Bobby Rush on Wednesday wrote a letter to the FBI asking the bureau to open a hate crime investigation into the attack.

âAs you are aware, crimes of this nature strike fear at the very core of a community and have a long-lasting impact on its members,â Rush wrote to FBI Director Christopher Wray. âThey are, therefore, rightfully characterized as hate crimes.â

The FBI is already investigating a letter sent on Jan. 22 to Fox and âEmpireâ offices that used âthreatening languageâ toward Smollett, police said. The letter was laced with some type of white, powdery substance, according to a police spokesman.

A celebrity website, thatgrapejuice.net, published a picture of the letter with the words, âYou will die black fâ,â written in letters apparently cut from magazines.

The FBI has declined to comment on the case.

4528,Chicago,https://chicago.suntimes.com/2019/1/29/18395230/empire-star-victim-of-racist-homophobic-attack-in-streeterville-police-say,"An actor from the Fox series âEmpireâ was the target of an alleged racist and homophobic attack early Tuesday in Streeterville.

Chicago police are investigating the brutal incident as a hate crime. Meanwhile, the FBI is separately looking into a letter threatening the actor sent a week ago to the offices of the television show.

The actor, 35-year-old Jussie Smollett, flew into Chicago from New York on Monday to continue filming the new season of âEmpire.â

Smollett went for a late-night meal sometime after midnight at a Subway restaurant at 511 N. McClurg Court, police said. The actor was walking back to a nearby apartment about 2 a.m. when two people walked up to him in the 300 block of East North Lower Water Street, yelling racist and homophobic slurs, Smollett told police.

âThe alleged assailants made racially charged comments to the victim implying that they knew he was a star from the show,â police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said.

They then hit him in the face, poured a substance â suspected to be bleach â on him and put a rope around his neck, police said.

Smollett initially was âreluctantâ to call police because of the attention he would generate as a public figure, Guglielmi said. But his manager eventually called at 2:42 a.m., about 40 minutes after the attack.

When officers showed up at the apartment, the rope was still around Smollettâs neck, said Guglielmi, who described the rope as a âthin, light rope.â Guglielmi said the rope didnât necessarily resemble a noose.

Smollett asked officers to turn off their body cameras while interviewing him, which Guglielmi said is standard for many victims, especially inside a home.

After taking Smollettâs report, officers encouraged him to go to Northwestern Memorial Hospital for treatment to lacerations on his face and neck, Guglielmi said. Smollettâs manager took him to the hospital, and he was later released.

Smollett initially told police his attackers were two men wearing ski masks and all black clothing. In a follow-up interview in the morning, Smollett told detectives the men also yelled âthis is MAGA countryâ after they attacked him, according to Guglielmi. Smollett didnât provide any other description of the men, including their race.

Police also havenât found any video showing the attackers in the surrounding areas or any witnesses to the attack. Guglielmi said police didnât have enough information as of Tuesday night to put out a description of the attackers.

The block where the attack took place has some parking garage entrances but no retail businesses. But police were able to recover video from various business, residential and police cameras in the wider area. A surveillance camera at the Subway shows Smollett at the restaurant.

More than a dozen police detectives, some specializing in hate crimes, are working the case. They asked anyone with who has information or witnessed the attack to call detectives at (312) 747-8382 or submit an anonymous tip at cpdtip.com.

Meanwhile, the letter that the FBI is investigating was sent on Jan. 22 to Fox and âEmpireâ offices and used âthreatening languageâ toward Smollett, police said. The letter was laced with some type of white, powdery substance, according to Guglielmi.

A celebrity website, GrapeJuice.net, published a picture of the letter with the words, âYou will die black fâ,â written in letters apparently cut from magazines.

The FBI declined to comment on the case.

Smollettâs role as the gay son of a record company mogul in the Fox drama propelled him to fame after it debuted four years ago. Smollett, who is gay, has been active in LBGTQ issues. He also released his debut album, âSum of My Music,â last year.

âEmpireâ co-creator Lee Daniels voiced his disgust over the incident and his support for Smollett in an Instagram video.

âYou didnât deserve, nor anybody deserves, to have a noose put around your neck,â Daniels said. âYou are better than that, we are better than that, America is better than that.â

âWe send our love to Jussie, who is resilient and strong, and we will work with law enforcement to bring these perpetrators to justice,â20th Century Fox officials wrote in a statement. âThe entire studio, network and production stands united in the face of any despicable act of violence and hate â and especially against one of our own.â

California Sen. Kamala Harris, a 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful, knows Smollett personally and called the attack âoutrageousâ and âawful.â

4532,Miami,https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/miami-hotel-dishwasher-forced-to-work-sundays-awarded-21-million-by-jury/3417/,"A former dishwasher at a Miami hotel, fired after missing work on Sundays for religious reasons, was awarded a $21 million jury verdict.

Sixty-year-old Marie Jean Pierre was a dishwasher at the Conrad Miami Hotel for more than a decade until she was fired in March 2016.

Pierre, a devout Christian missionary born in Haiti, said she was fired by her boss at the hotel after she missed six Sundays from work to attend Bethel Baptist Church in Miami.

Pierre argued that she had informed her employer when she was hired that she could not work Sundays because of her religious beliefs and should not have been scheduled to work on the Sundays she missed.

""I love God. No work on Sunday, because Sunday I honor God,"" Pierre said Wednesday in an interview with NBC 6 Miami.

Her lawsuit argued that her former employer, which was managed by Hilton at the time, had violated the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which protects workers from discrimination on the basis of race, religion, sex or national origin.

A jury in federal court ruled in her favor on Monday, granting her $21 million in damages, plus $35,000 in back wages and $500,000 for emotional pain and mental anguish.

""They accommodated her for seven years, and they easily could have accommodated her, but instead of doing that, they set her up for absenteeism and threw her out,"" her attorney Marc Brumer said. ""She's a soldier of Christ. She was doing this for all the other workers who are being discriminated against.""

The company said it was disappointed by the jury's decision and that it intends to appeal.

""During Ms. Pierreâs ten years with the hotel, multiple concessions were made to accommodate her personal and religious commitments,"" Hilton said in a statement.

Federal law requires an employer to make reasonable considerations for religious practices. Brumer said he hopes the verdict sets a standard.

""This was not about money. This was about sending a message to other corporations whether big or small,"" he said. ""Whatever size you are, if youâre going to take the blood and sweat of your workers, you better accommodate them or let them at least believe in their religious beliefs.""

There is a cap on punitive damage awards in federal court, so Pierre can't receive the entire $21 million. But her attorney said he expects she will receive at least $500,000.

""I asked for $50 million, knowing that I was capped at $300,000,"" Brumer told NBC News on Wednesday. ""I didn't do this for money. I did this to right the wrongs.""",Miami Hotel Dishwasher Forced to Work Sundays Awarded 21 Million by Jury,auto_google,['indirect_city_relation'],['Miami']

That's life in the transfer portal for quarterbacks like Martell, who exemplify everything that is mostly right but sometimes wrong with the trend of musical chair transfer trend at the top of college football.

I'M A HURRICANE! ðð¼ð´ pic.twitter.com/6Dh0gu4fxD â TATE MARTELL (@TheTateMartell) January 16, 2019

Martell exemplifies all those twists and turns more than most. He was a four-star quarterback who starred at high school powerhouse Bishop Gorman High School in Las Vegas, and his story was chronicled in the Netflix series ""QB1: Beyond the Lights."" Of course Martell was going to be popular, given that backstory by the time he arrived on campus â maybe too popular, given the comparisons to former Texas A&M quarterback Johnny Manziel.

You could argue that exposure makes a quarterback more prepared for FBS competition, or more likely to transfer. There's truth to both sides.

Martell didn't play much as a freshman behind J.T. Barrett in 2017, but he launched into a three-way quarterback battle with Dwayne Haskins and Joe Burrow last spring with the expectation he would play.

""There will be packages (for me to contribute) if I don't win the starting job,"" Martell told reporters during spring practice.

Haskins won the starting job and finished third in the Heisman Trophy voting. Burrow transferred to LSU as a graduate transfer. Martell played in small doses and showed some of that playmaking ability that made him a viral sensation at Ohio State.

That was evident in the opener against Oregon State on Sept. 1, when Martell bolted into the secondary before launching a sideways pitch to C.J. Saunders for a first down.

""From my angle I thought he fumbled the ball, so my heart jumped out of my throat,"" Ohio State acting coach Ryan Day said afterward. ""He was actually being Tate, which is he's a playmaker. â¦ That's what he did there. He's a playmaker. So, as the season goes on, he'll have more and more opportunities to show that.""

Martell finished 10 of 10 for 121 yards with 95 rushing yards and two total touchdowns in mop-up duty against Rutgers the next week, but he wasn't used much more than that. He finished with 269 passing yards, 128 rushing yards and three touchdowns this season, but was still a polarizing talent with the fan base.

It still appeared Martell would be the odds-on favorite to take over for the Buckeyes in 2019. With Day taking over for Urban Meyer, however, Martell's future at Ohio State was questioned before it even started. Martell's situation was impacted by Justin Fields, a five-star recruit who transferred from Georgia after just one season with the Bulldogs and will apply for hardship waiver that would allow him to play right away at Ohio State.

When two highly touted recruits collide, this is going to happen every time. That's one issue with this trend, and an adjustment fans will be forced to make as quarterbacks come and go. The veneer of commitment between coach and quarterback â and player and school â is thinner now than it's ever been. Ohio State is not the exception. Look at SN's pre-preseason top 25, where nine of the top 10 schools have been affected by the transfer market in the past year.

MORE: SN's pre-preseason top 25 for 2019

Kelly Bryant and Hunter Johnson transferred once it was clear the Trevor Lawrence era was in effect at Clemson. Notre Dame's Brandon Wimbush transferred to UCF. Jalen Hurts â who led Alabama to two College Football Playoff championship games â transferred to Oklahoma. Then Oklahoma's Austin Kendall, after initially being blocked, transferred to West Virginia.

It's a dizzying process for both sides. You can't blame Day for taking in a five-star transfer. Itâs his job to win football games and bring in competition at every position.

You also can't blame Martell for leaving either, even when he told reporters at Ohio State's Rose Bowl media day he was ""100 percent sure"" he would be the starting quarterback at Ohio State next season.

Tate Martell was asked who is going to be the next starting quarterback at Ohio State.

""I will.""

Level of confidence?

""I'm 100-percent sure on that."" â Austin Ward (@AWardSports) December 30, 2018

Things change. You could say Martell didn't want to compete with Fields or that the Buckeyes have their mind made up about the future. In reality, this was the best chance for both quarterbacks to play.

That's also life in the transfer portal, and thatâs why the fact a school lands a four- or five-star quarterback doesn't mean quite as much as it used to. The impact for Ohio State could be felt if Fields is not granted the waiver, and that would open the door for Matthew Baldwin to start. Martell could also apply for a waiver, perhaps based on the coaching change, but if the NCAA allows that, it opens the door for even more transfers.

That is a lot of paperwork. It's becoming clear the graduate transfer rule, which allows players to play immediately if they graduate from the previous school, will not be enough to slow the influx of transfer quarterbacks. What are the possible solutions? Will the NCAA eventually allow players to transfer without sitting out a year? What kind of restrictions for the players or schools come with?

That will take time, but a more player-friendly transfer system will only help â and deflect from the ongoing pay-for-play argument. After all, this is a world where Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh just offered a seventh-grade quarterback a scholarship.

Sure, this happens at other positions, but it will always be most visible at quarterback. Itâs only intensifying as they seem more prepared for the next level â but perhaps not ready to accept there's only one spot available to start.

Which circles back to Martell, who is the first big get for new Miami coach Manny Diaz. That decision helped Hurricanes receiver Jeff Thomas leave the transfer portal. Martell, whether in 2019 or 2020, will be a playmaker for the Hurricanes at a position in which the team struggled last season. You can ask why Martell canât play right now, or question the circumstances around his departure from Ohio State â and on some level youâd be right both ways.

Thatâs life in the transfer portal, and Martell is right back like he never left.

TUSCALOOSA â The exodus of Nick Saban's assistant coaching staff continued into Friday after the University of Miami announced the hiring of now-former Alabama quarterbacks coach Dan Enos as the Hurricanes' new offensive coordinator.

Enos, who was reportedly rumored to be the front-runner to replace Mike Locksley as the Crimson Tide's offensive coordinator, left Alabama after just a season in Tuscaloosa, where he was viewed as instrumental to the development of the Crimson Tide's record-breaking passing attack this season. Enos was also credited with further developing dual-threat quarterback Jalen Hurts into a more refined passer.

""Dan was my primary target for our offensive coordinator position from the outset and I'm thrilled that he's now a Miami Hurricane,"" new Miami head coach Manny Diaz said in a statement announcing Enos' hiring. ""Dan is one of the most innovative play-callers in college football and he not only has a remarkable track record of coaching quarterbacks, but also developing players for the NFL at numerous positions. His experience as a head coach will also provide invaluable insight to our entire program.""

Enos is the fourth member of Alabama's offensive coaching staff to leave the program in the last week, joining co-offensive coordinator and receivers coach Josh Gattis (Michigan), offensive line coach Brent Key (Georgia Tech), and Locksley, who was named Maryland's next head coach last month during the Tide's playoff run. Gattis was named the Wolverines' offensive coordinator Thursday afternoon, while Key returned to his alma mater with the elevated titles of associate head coach and run game coordinator in addition to his offensive line coach responsibilities.

Special teams coordinator and tight ends coach Jeff Banks and running backs coach Joe Pannunzio are all that's left of last season's offensive staff, which helped set multiple single-season program records in 2018.

Under Enos' tutelage as quarterbacks coach, Alabama sophomore Tua Tagovailoa reset the standard for quarterbacks in Tuscaloosa, throwing for a single-season record 3,966 passing yards and 43 touchdowns en route to finishing as the Heisman Trophy runner-up this season. Tagovailoa also won the Maxwell and Walter Camp Player of the Year awards.

Miami would be Enos' 12th program in his 28 years as a collegiate assistant, and third in the past three seasons â fourth if counting his brief month-long foray at Michigan last winter.

Whoever Saban ultimately hires would be Alabama's fifth offensive coordinator in the last four seasons, joining Lane Kiffin and Steve Sarkisian in 2016, Brian Daboll in 2017 and Locksley in 2017.",Alabama QB coach Dan Enos is named Miami OC,auto_google,['sport_news'],[]

4536,Miami,https://miami.cbslocal.com/2019/01/03/video-shows-miami-dade-police-officer-kicking-handcuffed-suspect/,"



MIAMI (CBSMiami) â A cellphone video showing a Miami-Dade police officer kicking a handcuffed suspect was released Thursday by the Miami-Dade State Attorneyâs Office.

Seargent Gustavo De Los Rios, 38, was charged with a misdemeanor for the incident which took place in February.

The video shows several officers arresting a suspect, then De Los Rios is seen kicking the suspect once and then dropping his knee on his neck.

De Los Rios was relieved of duty with pay at the time the complaint was filed.

The incident occurred in Miami Lakes on Valentineâs Day of 2018.

Officers pulled over a teenager wanted for burglary on 57th avenue. According to prosecutors, the teen fought officers who tried to use their Taser.

Eventually, he was placed in handcuffs on the ground. Thatâs when according to the state attorney, De Los Rios crossed the line.

âRight after he put the handcuffs on. Heâs down on the ground. Heâs not moving. Heâs under control. The officer just comes and gives him a kick, with what I believe is his right foot, to the left side of his face,â State attorney Katherine Fernandez-Rundle said.

The kick did not seriously injure the teen but Fernandez-Rundle says thatâs beside the point. âThat is unacceptable and intolerable and thatâs why we charged him.â

Miami Dade Policeâs director put out a statement at the time, which read: âThe Miami-Dade Police Department became aware of a concerning video involving the actions of one of our own. An investigation was immediately initiated in collaboration with the Miami-Dade State Attorneyâs Office. As a result, Sergeant Gustavo De Los Rios has been charged with misdemeanor battery. His actions are disappointing and do not reflect our agencyâs core values. I assure our community that all allegations of misconduct, involving our personnel, will be vigorously investigated. No one is above the law.â

Personally, De Los Rios has had a rocky few years. He was arrested for domestic abuse in an incident with his ex-wife last year. Court filings show restraining orders as well. Professionally, the Miami Herald reports nothing significant, outside of a 2015 incident where De Los Rios abused his power to find out about his ex-wifeâs travel plans.

Fernandez-Rundle said this is proof the system is working, that no one above the law. âItâs so disappointing when a few of these officers just abuse the trust that we have in them, in this way. It affects all of us,â she said.

Less than one day after being named the latest head coach of the Miami Hurricanes football team, Manny Diaz reportedly wasted no time in making major changes to his staff for the 2019 season.

The South Florida Sun-Sentinel reported that Diaz has fired every assistant coach on the offensive side of the ball â including quarterbacks coach Jon Richt, the son of former head coach Mark Richt who retired Sunday after three seasons leading his alma mater.

Along with the younger Richt, Diaz let go offensive coordinator and running backs coach Thomas Brown, wide receivers coach Ron Dugans, tight ends coach Todd Hartley and offensive line coach Stacy Searels as well as strength and conditioning coach Gus Felder.

The school has not confirmed any moves within the program.

Diaz spent three seasons as the defensive coordinator with the âCanes â making the unit one of the best in college football during that span â before being named the head coach of the Temple Owls earlier this month. However, his tenure with that team lasted less than three weeks as he was hired less than 10 hours after Mark Richt announced his retirement.

Miami will reportedly pay $4 million to Temple as part of Diazâs contract buyout.

During the 2018 season, the offense struggled for a Miami team who has lost nine of their last 16 games after starting last season 10-0. The Hurricanes ranked 105th in the FBS out of 130 teams in total offense and 113th in passing last season.

The Canes were held to just three points in their blowout loss to Wisconsin in the Pinstripe Bowl last week, leading to calls for Richt to make changes to the coaching staff that including firing his son as well as relinquishing play calling duties.

Richt, who returned to his alma mater after 15 seasons as a head coach at Georgia and 15 before that as a top assistant coach at Florida State, instead stepped down for what he called the âbest interestâ of the program.

During his first interview after returning to Miami, Diaz said that finding help on offense â from a coordinator to a quarterback and more â is at the top of his list of priorities

""In terms of establishing the identity of what we're going to be on offense and what that vision should be, it's very similar to what we've been on defense,"" Diaz said on WQAM, the Hurricanes' flagship station. ""We came here three years ago and set a vision of how the Miami Hurricanes play defense and what in my mind fits best for the talent that's available to us here in South Florida.""

Diaz stayed with the Hurricanes through last week's Pinstripe Bowl. He returned to Miami on Friday and spent the weekend putting together what he thought would be his Temple coaching staff.

But around midday Sunday, Diaz's wife heard the news that Richt stepped down.

Craziness ensued from there.

""It's been wild. There's no other way to explain it,"" Diaz said in the radio interview. ""It's something that when everybody woke up yesterday morning, no one could have predicted. They don't write scripts for these things. If they did they would get thrown in the trash because no one would believe it.""

Defense has been the much stronger side of the ball for Miami during Diaz's three years at the school. Under Diaz, Miami has allowed 4.6 yards per play â among all other Football Bowl Subdivision schools, only Alabama (4.2), Clemson (4.4), Michigan (4.4) and Washington (4.55) have allowed less in that three-year span.

The offense hasn't had the same success, and struggled mightily this year. So far this season, with some bowl games left, 73 different quarterbacks have thrown for more yards by themselves than Miami did as a team in 2018. Diaz said returnees N'Kosi Perry and Jarren Williams will have a chance to win the job, but made clear that he's also going to look at transfers.

""If you don't have excellence at that position, it's very hard to compete in this day and age,"" Diaz said. ""We've got some guys on campus who have been in the system and I think this is their time now to turn the page and decide whether they're capable of being the starting quarterback at the University of Miami. But at the same time we've got to create competition because competition is the best coach there is.""

Diaz, who will hold a news conference later this week, also told WQAM that he felt badly about how the situation transpired for Temple and spoke again about how thankful he was that the Owls gave him their job.

He also insisted that, with the late part of recruiting season looming and staffing decisions to make, he needs to move on quickly.

4538,Dallas,https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/cowboys-vs-seahawks-final-score-takeaways-dallas-rides-ezekiel-elliott-to-wild-playoff-win-over-seattle/,"There's a reason they call it the wild-card round, and the reason is because you get wildly entertaining games like the one played on Saturday night in Dallas.

In a game that wasn't decided until Dallas recovered an onside kick with 1:16 left to play, the Cowboys outlasted the Seahawks 24-22 for a win that will now be sending Jason Garrett's team to the divisional round next week against either the Saints or the Rams.

To pick up their first playoff win in four years, the Cowboys did what they they've done a lot of this season: They fed Ezekiel Elliott.

Elliott, who finished 2018 as the NFL's leading rusher with 1,434 yards, slowly wore down the Seahawks defense on a night where he carried the ball 26 times for 137 yards and a touchdown. Elliott tends to shine in the fourth quarter, and that's exactly what he did against Seattle.

With just 7:20 left to play and the Cowboys clinging to a 17-14 lead, Dallas needed to put together a time-consuming drive, and so they decided to feed Zeke. On an 11-play drive that ran 5:12 off the clock and essentially iced the game, Elliott carried the ball five times for 31 yards. The Seahawks could only watch as precious seconds ticked away after each one of Elliott's carries.

Elliott's performance on the drive set up Dak Prescott for a one-yard score that proved to be the game-winning touchdown.

Although Elliott came up big on that fourth quarter drive, he did most of his damage in the first half, when he carried the ball 13 times for 91 yards. One of the biggest plays of the game came on a third-and-1 for the Cowboys with just 1:09 left to play until halftime. At the time, Dallas was trailing 6-3 and If they didn't convert the third down from their own 34-yard line, they would have had to punt the ball back to Seattle.

Not only did Elliott get the one yard for the first down, but he also tacked on 43 more yards to set the Cowboys up at the Seahawks' 22-yard line.

The run was pivotal because it gave the Cowboys a chance to get a touchdown right before halftime. With just 24 seconds left to play in the second quarter, Prescott hit Michael Gallup for a score that put the Cowboys up 14-10 at the half.

Prescott wasn't perfect in this game, but he did more than enough to keep the pressure off Elliott. Not to mention, the Cowboys quarterback came through when the team needed him the most. In a play that basically saved the win for the Cowboys, Prescott converted a third-and-14 by pulling off a miraculous 16-yard run with under 2:45 left to play in the game.

Overall, Prescott rushed for 29 yards to go along with his 226-yard passing performance.

If the Cowboys win the Super Bowl, they might want to send a ring to Jon Gruden, and that's because most of Prescott's passing yardage went to former Raiders receiver Amari Cooper. Cooper continued to come up big for the Cowboys and this time, he did it with a seven-catch, 106-yard performance that included the 34-yard reception you can see below.

That catch, which came in the fourth quarter, set up a one-yard touchdown run by Elliott that gave the Cowboys the lead for good at 17-14.

The Cowboys' new version of the triplets seems to be catching fire at the right time, and there's no reason to think that this team can't upset either the Saints or the Rams next week.

Dallas D puts clamps on Seahawks run game

During the 2018 season, the Seahawks led the NFL in rushing with 160 yards per game, but they got nowhere close to that number in Dallas. Going up against a relentless Cowboys defense, the Seahawks were only able to muster 73 yards on 24 carries. The numbers are actually even uglier than that if you consider that 28 of those yards came on one carry, which means that Seattle gained just 45 yards on their 23 other rushes (1.96 yards per carry).

Seahawks running back Chris Carson, who finished the season with 1,151 yards, had nowhere to run. At halftime, he had just 16 yards and he was only able to tack on four more in the second half. Cowboys linebacker Leighton Vander Esch, who's a strong Defensive Rookie of the Year candidate, was all over the field with 10 tackles. One key part of the Seahawks rushing attack is Russell Wilson, but he was mostly ineffective thanks to a perfectly designed defensive strategy from the Cowboys. For most of the game, the Cowboys had a shadow on Wilson to prevent the Seahawks quarterback from doing any damage with his legs, and the plan worked, because Wilson only rushed for 17 yards.

Seahawks help stop the Seahawks

Although the Cowboys deserve a lot of credit for shutting down the Seahawks offense, they also got some help from Seahawks offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer, who seemed lost calling plays. For the most part, the Seahawks spent the game running on first and second down, then hoping that Russell Wilson could bail them out on third down.

The problem for the Seahawks is that kind of offensive strategy just doesn't work when you're playing a defense as good as the Cowboys. Although Wilson had an impressive night (18 of 27, 233 yards, one touchdown), none of his magic was working on third down with the Seahawks going just 2 of 13 on third down conversions.

Schottenheimer's obsession with sticking with something that wasn't working (the run game) didn't make any sense, and that's mostly because Wilson came up huge when he was actually allowed to throw. For instance, the Seahawks quarterback single-handedly kept his team in the game when he converted a fourth-and-6 in the third quarter with this perfect throw to Doug Baldwin.

The crazy thing is that Wilson was making throws like that all game. The Seahawks quarterback would put the ball where only his receiver could get it, and then his receiver would make a huge play. Here's a look at a 25-yard pass that Tyler Lockett caught in the second quarter.

Schottenheimer's desire to stay with a run game that absolutely wasn't working turned the Seahawks into a one-dimensional team that the Cowboys easily shut down. Lockett, who caught four passes for 120 yards, was one of the few bright spots for the Seahawks offense.

Home-field advantage is alive and well at Jerry World

Although Seattle is known as a tough place to play, it's the Cowboys that have actually had one of the best home-field advantages in the NFL this year. Dallas finished the regular season with a 7-1 record at Jerry World, which was tied for the best home record in the NFC. The Cowboys asked their fans to wear white on Saturday to match the team's white uniforms, and let's just say, the fans in Dallas came through.

Everyone loves to joke about Cowboys fans being bandwagon jumpers, but the fact of the matter is that this fan base has stood by the organization for nearly 25 years even though the Cowboys haven't come anywhere close to sniffing a Super Bowl since 1995. You could tell the fans in Dallas were eager to see the win on Saturday, and they came out in full force to AT&T Stadium to give the Cowboys a true home-field advantage against the Seahawks.

The Cowboys could actually end up hosting one more game this postseason, but that would only happen if they end up playing the Eagles, which means the Cowboys would need Philadelphia to somehow put together another magical playoff run. If the Eagles and Cowboys meet in the NFC Championship, the game would be played in Dallas on Jan. 20.

Allen Hurns carted off after gruesome injury

The Cowboys lost Allen Hurns for the night after he suffered an ugly injury midway through the first quarter. The injury happened after Hurns caught a big 14-yard pass on a third-and-7 play for the Cowboys. As Hurns was fighting to get a few more yards, he got hit by Seahawks safety Bradley McDougald, who came down on the receiver's left ankle. In what can only be described as one of the most gruesome injuries you'll ever see, McDougald's body weight snapped Hurns' ankle. The game had to be stopped for nearly 10 minutes so trainers could take care of Hurns and get him carted off the field.

The good news is that Hurns was able to give a thumbs up before he was taken off the field.

Cowboys owner Jerry Jones revealed after the game that Hurns immediately underwent surgery after leaving the stadium. According to Jones, Hurns dislocated his ankle and fractured his knee.

Kicker problems

One storyline that was hanging over the second half of this game was the health of Sebastian Janikowski. The Seahawks kicker injured himself while attempting a 57-yard field goal at the end of the first half, and by the start of the third quarter, he had been ruled doubtful to return before eventually being ruled out. That left the kicking duties to Seahawks punter Michael Dickson, who isn't exactly known for his ability to placekick.

Um, if this comes down to a field goal, the Seahawks might be in trouble. #SEAvsDAL #Cowboys #Seahawks pic.twitter.com/g4Iolwq1FB â John Breech (@johnbreech) January 6, 2019

Dickson was missing field goals left and right during his halftime warm-up, and apparently, things were so bad that Pete Carroll decided not to attempt any kicks in the second half.

The Seahawks scored two touchdowns in the second half and after each score, Carroll decided to go for two (the Seahawks scored on both conversions). Although Dickson wasn't forced to try a game-winning field goal, he did kill any chances Seattle had of winning when botched the onside kick with 1:16 left to play. Someone must have forgotten to tell Dickson that an onside kick only needs to go 10 yards, because he sent it more than 30 yards down the field.

The big kick was good news for Cole Beasley, who made the easiest onside recovery of his life.

Up next

Although the Cowboys will definitely be playing in the Divisional Round next week, they won't find out who they're playing until after the Eagles-Bears game on Sunday. If the favored Bears come away with the win, then the Cowboys will be headed for New Orleans in a game that would be played on January 13. This will be a rematch of a Week 13 game played in Dallas where the Cowboys upset the Saints 13-10. On the other hand, if the Eagles pull off the upset in Chicago, then Dallas will be headed to Los Angeles for a Saturday night showdown with the Rams.

As for the Seahawks, their season is now over, which means they can start focusing on things like the combine and free agency. The Seahawks can also turn their eyes to the draft. Since they were eliminated in the wild-card round, the Seahawks will pick either 21st or 22nd during the first round of the 2019 NFL Draft.

After the Cowboys' 30-22 loss, Owens tweeted at team owner Jerry Jones saying he should consider moving on from Garrett.

Owens, who played under Garrett when Garrett was the Cowboys' offensive coordinator in 2007 and 2008, has previously questioned the coach's credentials. In May, he told 105.3 The Fan in Dallas that ""the Cowboys are] not really expanding or progressing even as a team under his coaching tenure there."" Owens also questioned Garrett's playcalling while he was on the Cowboys in 2008.

On Saturday, Owens also tweeted that players are hoping Garrett will be dismissed. He did acknowledge in one response that some of his attitude could be related to how his tenure in Dallas ended.

Garrett has been the Cowboys' coach since 2011. He has an overall record of 79-62 with Dallas, which includes eight games as interim coach in 2010 and a 2-3 playoff record. He is the second-longest-tenured coach and second-winningest coach in franchise history after Tom Landry.

(Photo by Brian Blanco/Getty Images)

Despite having posted a 10-6 regular season and a playoff win, could the Dallas Cowboys still replace head coach Jason Garrett with Sean Payton?

In January of 2007, Bill Parcells retired as the head coach of the Dallas Cowboys after a four-year run. For the first three of those four seasons, Sean Payton was the Cowboysâ assistant head coach, quarterbacksâ coach and eventually became the passing game coordinator as well.

Payton was as close to being the Cowboysâ head coach under Parcells as one could get without the title. And he was responsible for bringing quarterback Tony Romo to Dallas. Many believe that if Parcells had retired one season earlier than Payton would have been the next head coach of Americaâs Team.

Instead, Payton became the head coach of the New Orleans Saints in 2006. He would lead the struggling franchise to their first and only Super Bowl victory just four years later. Now, heâs on the cusp of leading the Saints to yet another Super Bowl appearance as New Orleans will face off against the Los Angeles Rams this weekend in the NFC Championship game.

Itâs a postseason matchup the Cowboys are forced to watch from the comfort of their own homes as Dallas was eliminated from playoff contention last weekend by those same Rams.

Following a successful year where the Cowboys bounced back from a 3-5 start to end the season with a 10-6 record, winning the NFC East title and posting a playoff victory over the Seattle Seahawks in the Wild Card round; it appears on the surface that head coach Jason Garrett has earned himself a contract extension in Dallas.

Although Garrett has another year left on his current deal, the Cowboys are rumored to want to lock up the nine-year head coach for the foreseeable future. But the good folks over at Pro Football Talk seem to think that owner and general manager Jerry Jones may be leaving the door open for another head coach to take the helm of the Cowboys soon.

On Tuesday, Jones told 105.3 The Fan that he could not comment on potential staff changes because he has the last say and that they may see an opportunity next week that they didnât have this week.

Hereâs what Mike Florio of Pro Football Talk speculated might be the reason for Jonesâ cryptic response.

âSo what opportunity could arise next week? â¦ Next week, coaches will be available, in theory, who arenât available now â¦ Is Jones suggesting that, if the Saints lose, the Cowboys would explore upgrading from Jason Garrett to Sean Payton?â

The relationship between Sean Payton, Jerry Jones, and Stephen Jones is well documented. And Paytonâs future in New Orleans is likely tied to the game this weekend and the future of 40-year old quarterback Drew Brees. The Saintsâ head coach is also under contract through 2020, which would be another obstacle to tackle.

The recent firing of Scott Linehan as offensive coordinator could be an indication that Garrett will remain in Dallas, especially if the Cowboys hire another OC anytime soon. The team has been reportedly interviewing candidates and youâd think if Payton was considered an option Dallas could hold off on hiring anyone until he was possibly available as a new head coach would certainly want to hire his own staff.

The biggest question is would Jerry Jones actually replace Jason Garrett after a successful season in Dallas? If he does, it likely has to do with who is available to replace Garrett and the fact the 76-year old Jones isnât getting any younger.",Is Sean Payton the Dallas Cowboys next head coach ,auto_google,['sport_news'],[]

4542,Dallas,https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/25825314/dallas-mavericks-ban-fan-heckled-patrick-beverley-la-clippers,"DALLAS -- When the LA Clippers visit the American Airlines Center on Tuesday night, Patrick Beverley won't encounter the Dallas Mavericks fan whose heckling played a prominent role in the fiery guard's ejection earlier this season.

Sources told ESPN that Don Knobler, a fan known for his flamboyant wardrobe who has long sat courtside at Mavericks home games, was banned from the arena for the remainder of the season after an investigation by the organization confirmed Beverley's account of their interaction.

According to sources, fans complained that Knobler had inappropriately heckled opposing players on other occasions as well.

Beverley was ejected with 9:10 remaining in the Clippers' Dec. 2 loss in Dallas after throwing a crisp bounce pass at Knobler, who was seated on the baseline near the LA bench. After the game, Beverley said that Knobler told him ""F--- your mother!"" on two different occasions, prompting his reaction.

Knobler told ESPN after the game that he said ""Your mother"" to Beverley earlier in the game during an exchange after the Clippers guard's elbow knocked out the tooth of Mavs guard Dennis Smith Jr.

Knobler denied using profanity.

""I told the referee, I told the security,"" Beverley said to reporters after the game. ""I mean, I've never gotten ejected out of a game since I've been in the NBA. You know, I play hard, I play within the lines, of course. I play within the rules, of course. I've never been ejected in my career in the NBA, but I'm a grown man. I have morals. Of course, God is first, family is second for me, and I stand firmly behind that.

""I just, I can accept the 'F--- you, Beverley,' the 'F--- you, Pat,' but out of the lines of my mother, anybody who knows me, man, knows I'm a family-first guy, and there's some things that are unacceptable. After I told the refs, I told security, the Dallas security, told both of them and again, he said it again. So if no one is going to control fans, what are we supposed to do as players?""

Knobler, who has not attended a Mavs game since Dallas' win over the Clippers, did not return a message left at his business Tuesday. The Mavs declined to comment on Knobler's suspension from the arena.

Even on a night when Stephen Curry scored 48 points and hit 11 3-pointers in a 119-114 win over the Mavericks, it was Doncic's promise that was a large topic of postgame conversation for the back-to-back NBA champions.

""He's unbelievable,"" Curry said of Doncic. ""You can tell he's just experienced in terms of playing high-level basketball. A guy that's always at his own pace. I'm sure he had heard all the doubters and people talking about his game who really didn't know much about him, and he's made himself known for sure. It's fun to watch in terms of the future of the league.""

The Warriors have been singing Doncic's praises all season, having already seen him three times this season, but it was Warriors coach Steve Kerr who took that praise to a higher level prior to Sunday's game.

""The guy doesn't look like a rookie,"" Kerr said Saturday. ""I didn't know much about him, I never saw him play until we played Dallas the first time or watching him on TV before that, but he is confident beyond where you would expect somebody in his shoes to be, coming from a different country and being 19 years old. He's a brilliant player. I think he's already an All-Star. I don't know how the vote's going to shake out, but he looks like an All-Star player to me.""

Kerr clarified his statement during Sunday's pregame.

""I haven't really done the math,"" Kerr said. ""I haven't gone line by line. So I probably threw that out there without truly doing my homework. I do have a vote for reserves. I think what I meant to say is he sure looks like an All-Star. So whether he makes it or not, he's an All-Star. Certain guys just stand out. You see what they do, you see what they mean to the game. And if he doesn't make it this year, he's going to make it soon enough.""

After watching the 19-year-old rookie go off for 26 points, six rebounds and five assists later in the night, the strong opinions about Doncic's game only strengthened.

4546,Dallas,https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/local/former-dallas-officer-amber-guyger-attends-court-hearing/8320/,"Former Dallas police officer Amber Guyger had a procedural court hearing Tuesday morning in Dallas. She faces a murder charge in the shooting death of unarmed neighbor Botham Jean, court records show.

She and her attorney were at the Dallas County Frank Crowley Courts Building about 8 a.m.

Although Guyger was in the building, she did not appear in open court.

Her attorneys spent most of the morning with prosecutors behind closed doors in the judge's chambers, where they hashed out details on media coverage of her upcoming trial.

Former Dallas police officer Amber Guyger had a procedural court hearing Tuesday morning in Dallas. She faces a murder charge in the shooting death of unarmed neighbor Botham Jean, court records show.

Because of the extensive coverage of this case, the judge also issued a gag order, noting that ""as a result of statements made to, and published by, the press a serious and imminent threat to the constitutional right of the defendant herein to a fair trial exists.""

Guyger, 30, who is white, was charged with manslaughter Sept. 9 following an investigation by the Texas Rangers into the Sept. 6 fatal shooting that killed her black neighbor, 26-year-old accountant Botham Jean. Upon hearing the evidence, the grand jury opted Friday to indict Guyger on the more serious murder charge and took no action on the manslaughter charge filed by the Texas Rangers.

Dallas County District Attorney Faith Johnson said Friday afternoon that even though the Texas Rangers were the lead investigative agency in the case, her office conducted their own investigtion and that she was confident once the grand jury heard the evidence presented by her office that they would ""do the right thing.""

Former Dallas police officer Amber Guyger is now facing a murder charge in the shooting death of unarmed neighbor Botham Jean, court records show.

Dallas County District Attorney Faith Johnson said Friday afternoon that even though the Texas Rangers were the lead investigative agency in the case, her office conducted their own investigation and that she was confident once the grand jury heard the evidence presented by her office that they would ""do the right thing.""

""Our office ... did a thorough job of presenting this case to the grand jury. Not only presenting the evidence but also explaining the law,"" Johnson said. ""Once the grand jury heard this case, they did return an indictment for murder.""

Guyger's attorney, Robert Rogers, said he disappointed in the indictment but not suprised.

""Although I am disappointed that the grand jury returned an indictment, in light of the political pressure and outpouring of vindictive emotion, I canât say that I am surprised. This is a terrible tragedy that resulted from a true mistake. We are confident that a dispassionate jury in a fair forum will objectively apply the law to the facts and find Amber not guilty,"" said Rogers.

Jean's family, who have filed a federal civil lawsuit against Guyger and the city of Dallas, stood beside Johnson Friday as she discussed the grand jury's decision.

Jean's mother, Allison Jean, told the media she was satisfied with the murder indictment and thanked the people of Dallas for rallying around her son.

""I'm truly grateful for that. I want to thank the DA's office, particularly DA Faith Johnson, for the work that her staff have put into gathering evidence and presenting to the grand jury in order to return such an indictment,"" Allison Jean said. ""I look forward to the next step, which is a conviction of murder of Amber Guyger. And more so of a penalty, the proper penalty that will cause her to reflect on what she has done and the pain she has caused... So, I'm depending on you to continue to rally with us as we seek continued justice for him.""

Former Dallas police officer Amber Guyger is now facing a murder charge in the shooting death of unarmed neighbor Botham Jean, court records show. Jean's Family reacts to the news.

Botham's father, Bertrum Jean, added, ""It is such a hard thing to go through. We miss our boy dearly. He didn't deserve that. He was such a sweet boy, in his home. How can we move on without him? But we will try.""

Botham Jean, a native of St. Lucia who attended college in Arkansas and had been working in Dallas for PwC, was in his own apartment Sept. 6 when Guyger shot and killed him. Following the shooting she told investigators she'd left work and was returning home to her apartment at the South Side Flats when she apparently got off on the wrong floor and entered the wrong apartment -- she said she shot Jean believing he was an intruder in her apartment.

Investigators would later confirm that Jean lived one floor directly above Guyger.

The case sparked protests and national debate over what charges she should face.

Jean's family, who have filed a lawsuit against Guyger and the city of Dallas, stood beside Johnson Friday as she discussed the grand jury's decision. Jean's mother, Allison Jean, told the media she was satisfied with the murder indictment and thanked the people of Dallas for rallying around her son.

Dallas Chief of Police U. Renee Hall said Friday, ""Every person in the Dallas Police Department continues to feel anguish about this difficult and tragic event that occurred on Sept. 6, 2018 ... Please continue to pray for the Botham Jean family, the Dallas Police Department and the city of Dallas as a whole.""

Hall also acknowledged some of the discord between communities and police and said her department supports restructuring the Citizen Review Board, pushed for more implicit bias training and continues to work with employee and community advisory boards.

Of the indictment, Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings said, ""Botham Jean was an incredible young man who was tragically taken from us too soon. Our city will never forget him. Todayâs decision is another step on the long path toward justice for Botham. We appreciate the work of the Texas Rangers and the Dallas County District Attorneyâs Office. Please continue to pray for the Jean family.""

Following the murder indictment, the Dallas chapter of the NAACP released the following statement:

""We are pleased with the decision of the grand jury to indict Amber Guyger for murder for the killing of Mr. Botham Shem Jean. This is the next step in securing a verdict that will be favorable to the evidence that will be presented by the District Attorneyâs Office. We would like to thank the District Attorneyâs Office for the thorough investigation that they have conducted in gathering evidence in the pursuit of justice. We call on the community to remain calm and let the criminal proceedings take its due course. However, we ask that you join us in continued prayer and support for the family and friends of Mr. Botham Shem Jean. The Dallas NAACP will remain vigilant in monitoring the proceedings of this case and look forward to justice being rendered.""

Guyger turned herself in for a 'walk through' at the Mesquite Jail on Friday afternoon. She will not be re-arrested on the new charge and her bond of $300,000 carries over from the manslaughter charge. She faces between five years to life in prison on the murder charge; the manslaughter charge carries a sentence of two to 20 years in prison.

Johnson, whose term is up as Dallas County DA in January 2019, said she's hopeful the new DA can convince a jury to return a proper verdict in the case.



Experts say a jury could still consider a manslaughter charge if they can't agree to convict for murder.

Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Cole Beasley, a free agent this offseason, took some shots at the Cowboys' front office on Tuesday over social media.

The 29-year-old expressed frustration with his lack of involvement in the offense last season through a series of tweets, arguing that upper management controls the offensive schemes.

""The front office pushes who they want to get the ball to,"" he tweeted Tuesday afternoon. ""I haven't been a huge priority in that regard. Maybe that will change but Iâm not sure. More balls come my way in 2 minute drill where nothing is planned.""

Beasley added that in terms of making a decision where to play in 2019, ""utilization is more important than money"" and that his agitation with the Dallas offensive play calls and front office ""doesnât mean Iâm gone.""

Beasley signed with the Cowboys as an undrafted free agent in 2012 after playing locally at Southern Methodist. In 2018, ironically, he experienced one of his most productive seasons â catching 65 of 87 passes for 672 yards to go with three touchdowns through 16 games; His 87 targets ranked second on the team behind Ezekiel Elliott.

""Iâll play anywhere where I can make more of an impact,"" he tweeted. ""I would love for that to be Dallas or anywhere else that will give me more pops to make an impact. I just wanna ball.

PHILADELPHIA -- A powerful union boss who has long held a tight grip on construction jobs in the Philadelphia region and wielded political power in the city and Statehouse has been indicted on embezzlement and fraud charges along with a city councilman who allegedly did his bidding, and six others.Johnny ""Doc"" Dougherty exerted complete control over the union, according to the 116-count indictment, using that power to ""repeatedly and persistently steal its funds and put his own self-interests over that of the membership."" All told, the defendants misspent more than $600,000 in union funds, officials said.Dougherty, 58, leads the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 98, with 5,000 members, along with the city's Building Trades Council, an umbrella group with more than 70,000 members. He has been at the helm of the century-old electricians union for 25 years.The union over the years has emerged as a major political donor, spending tens of millions of dollars through its political action committees, mostly to help Democrats in Pennsylvania.According to the indictment, Dougherty used union credit cards to buy groceries and household goods and to splurge on restaurants, and let others in his orbit do the same. He allegedly used union funds to pay contractors for work at his South Philadelphia home and bar. And he put friends and family members on the union's payroll, showering them with raises and overtime for hours they didn't work and using them to do personal tasks, prosecutors said.Councilman Bobby Henon, a former union official, got a $70,000 union salary to press Dougherty's interests at City Hall, officials said in the indictment unsealed Wednesday. Henon used his office to pressure Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Comcast Corp. and others to use union labor, prosecutors said at a morning news conference.The union paid Dougherty $1.4 million between 2010 and 2016. He and the other defendants are due to appear in court Friday.His lawyer, Henry E. Hockeimer, said Dougherty has devoted ""all his energies"" to the union for a quarter century, leading to dramatic increases in wages and benefits. ""To allege that John in any way attempted to defraud the union he cares about so deeply is preposterous,"" Hockeimer said in a statement.The full statement read: Dougherty helped Mayor Jim Kenney win election in 2015 , the same year his brother, Kevin Dougherty, won a seat on the state Supreme Court. Henon, who rose through the union ranks to become its political director before winning a City Council seat in 2011, was charged with honest services fraud and other charges.T.J. Rooney, a former state Democratic Party chairman, said the political reach of the electricians' union under Dougherty ""in the region is unparalled and in the state is tremendously impactful.""The electricians' union is easily the most influential private-sector labor union in Pennsylvania politics, rivaled only by public-sector labor unions, he said.Dougherty, however, is not ""some old-school cigar-chomping union boss,"" Rooney said. The union, under Dougherty, has expanded its numbers and profile through apprenticeship programs and its deep involvement in community projects and charitable missions, Rooney said.""That's not old-timey, that's new-schooley,"" he said.Henon has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. The councilman's office said Wednesday that he will continue to serve.Henon issued the following statement after the charges were announced:The defendants include Henon, the majority leader on council and chair of the public property and public works committee; union president Brian Burrows, and union officials Michael Neill, Marita Crawford, Niko Rodriguez and Brian Fiocca - Dougherty's nephew. Also charged was Anthona Massa, who ran a construction company that received more than $1.8 million from the union for work done between 2010 and 2016.___Associated Press reporter Marc Levy in Harrisburg, Michael Rubinkam in northeastern Pennsylvania and Claudia Lauer in Philadelphia contributed to this report.-----","Feds indict powerful Philly union boss Johnny Doc Dougherty, Councilman Bobby Henon, others",auto_google,['local_politics'],[]

Police later discovered that the sedan driver, Keith Campbell, was stabbed 15 to 20 times and that he may have stabbed himself.

South Philly String Band says ""family"" members died in the crash. Police ID'ed victims as Joseph Ferry, Dennis Palandro and Kelly Wiseley.

Three people, including two members of a Mummers string band fresh off the annual New Year's Day parade, died when a car slammed head on into their SUV in South Philadelphia early Wednesday.

Update: Police say the suspect left a ""strange"" rambling note in his wrecked car.

Two couples were in the Acura SUV as they drove along Packer Avenue near S. 7th Street around 1:45 a.m. when an Audi sedan crossed the center line and crashed into them head on, Philadelphia police said. The sedan driver had been stabbed at least 15 times. Police worked on the belief that the stab wounds could be self inflicted, accident division Capt. Mark Overwise said at a midday news conference.

The SUV driver Joseph Ferry, 36, of South Philadelphia; his fiancÃ©e Kelly Wiseley, 35, of Glenolden, Pennsylvania; and Dennis Palandro, 31, of Morton, Pennsylvania; all died at the scene, Overwise said.

Palandro's 30-year-old wife survived the crash and is being treated at the hospital for a broken pelvis and other injuries, police said.

The 29-year-old sedan driver â identified by police as Keith Campbell â also survived the wreck. He was the only person in that car at the time of the crash.

Ferry and Palandro were members of the South Philadelphia String Band, a group that performs in Philadelphia's storied and elaborate annual folk parade. The string band, which took home a second-place prize this year, later posted to Facebook that ""we are deeply saddened at the loss of our family members.""

Ferry's cousin, country music singer Payton Taylor, told NBC10 Ferry was her bass player during her first show.

""Completely woke up to our whole world just being shattered,"" she said.

Payton said she was excited to return to Philly after hearing about his engagement to Wisely during Christmas.

""Now instead of getting excited and planning a wedding, we're starting to make arrangements for a funeral,"" she said. ""And that's just the hardest. We're all still in shock.""

Overwise said a witness described the sedan as traveling at a ""high-rate of speed"" before the crash. Ferry, who was driving the SUV, was ejected from the vehicle. Wiseley, who was in a relationship with Ferry, was in the front passenger seat while Palandro and his wife were in the backseat. Palandro's father is the captain of the string band.

Campbell, who hails from Bear, Delaware, was listed in critical condition with 15 to 20 stab wounds to his chest and abdomen, police said.

""And, in that sedan vehicle we did findâ¦ a knife with a 10-inch blade, approximately, that was covered in blood,"" Small said.

It appeared that Campbell had stabbed himself but police needed to investigate further.

""It's highly unusual, I've never seen it before,"" Overwise said.

The crash blocked Packer Avenue, near the stadium complex, for hours Wednesday morning as police investigated all the circumstances around the wreck. Packer Avenue finally reopened just before 8 a.m.

The string band members were headed to the nearby Oregon Diner at the time of the crash.

Police plan to charge Campbell with multiple counts of a crash involving death or bodily injuries.

He was taken into custody around 10:45 a.m. ET by the Philadelphia Police Department.

Bobbitt, who was homeless at the time of the scam in 2017, is one of three people facing charges of second-degree theft by deception and conspiracy to commit theft by deception.

In November 2017, Kate McClure, 28, and Mark D'Amico, 39, created a GoFundMe they said would help Bobbitt after he gave McClure his last $20 when she was stranded on a freeway in Philadelphia.

The story, which initially many believed to be true, made national headlines and went viral on social media.

However, Bobbitt filed a lawsuit alleging that McClure and DâAmico were withholding most of the donations raked in through the campaign. His suit led to an investigation into the case.

Prosecutors said in November of last year that the three had allegedly made up the story after text messages showed that McClure and DâAmico were having financial troubles. They are accused of spending the money from the GoFundMe on luxury vehicles and vacations to Florida and Las Vegas.

Prosecutors also said the couple allegedly got Bobbitt in on the scam.

GoFundMe has since announced that refunds were given to everyone who donated money.

On Thursday, after Mayor Kenney's 100 day mandate, the Violence Prevention and Reduction Strategy Working Group revealed their plan.

""We want to see the homicide trend going down as it was up until 2017,"" said Mayor Kenney. ""We want to get it back to declining and our ultimate aspirational goal is zero.""

The plan, named ""The Philadelphia Roadmap to Safer Communities,"" looks to identify factors that create environments for gun crime. From promoting community health and looking at inequality to investing in police technology to help a program known as Operation Pinpoint.

Another key factor in the plan is improving reentry programs to help former inmates rebuild their lives.

Willie Wilcher, who spent time behind bars for robbery and arson, says he's living proof that lives can be saved on the street if given the right support.

""I've been out here in 11 years. I own a dump truck, a van, my own business of cleaning our houses. I've learned. My sons don't go to jail,"" said Wilcher.

HOUSTON, Texas (KTRK) -- We're learning more about the suspects police said opened fire on narcotics officers while they were trying to serve a search warrant in southeast Houston late Monday afternoon.Rhogena Nicholas, 58, and her husband Dennis Tuttle, 59, have been identified as the two suspects who were killed at the house in the 7800 block of Harding.Tuttle's sister says he grew up in the Houston area. She said he was a disabled veteran.""Released on honorable discharged medical,"" Elizabeth Ferrari said. ""He had debilitating injuries for many years and it's a sad situation.""Tuttle was married to Nicholas for 20 years. She also has family in Texas.Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo said the drug raid on the home stemmed from numerous complaints from neighbors. He said undercover officers had previously made two purchases of black tar heroin from drug dealers at the house.Armed with a search warrant, nine narcotics detectives backed up by at least six patrol officers surrounded the home just before 5 p.m. on Monday.After a 54-year-old officer, the lead investigator on the case, broke open the front door, a 33-year-old officer armed with a shotgun entered the residence and was immediately attacked by a pit bull, Acevedo said.He said that the officer being attacked shot and killed the dog.One of the suspects, Tuttle, charged from the back of the house firing a revolver at the officer, hitting him in the shoulder.""He went down and fell on the sofa in the living room,"" Acevedo said of the wounded officer. ""A female suspect went towards that officer, reached over the officer and started making a move for his shotgun.""Another officer who entered the house was allegedly shot by Tuttle.Acevedo said officers opened fire, killing Nicholas and engaged in a gun battle with Tuttle.He said the lead investigator who breached the door entered the house and was also shot.""After we had two officers down and another shot, the remaining officers ... started laying down cover fire, left positions of cover themselves and, I believe, they heroically pulled their fellow officers out of harm's way,"" Acevedo said.He said Tuttle followed the retreating officers to the front door and continued to fire at them before he was shot and killed.Police recovered two shotguns and three rifles from the residence and seized marijuana and a white powder they believe to be either cocaine or the powerful synthetic opioid fentanyl, Acevedo said.Tuttle's sister says they are sending prayers to the officers.""Our prayers are with the officers and the families that are affected,"" said Ferrari.",What we know about husband and wife killed in Houston officer-involved shooting,auto_google,['crime_incident'],['Houston']

4560,Houston,https://www.cbssports.com/college-football/news/houston-officially-hires-west-virginias-dana-holgorsen-as-next-coach-three-things-to-know/,"Following multiple reports over the weekend, Houston officially announced on Wednesday that it has hired Dana Holgorsen.

The now-former West Virginia coach of eight years was a top candidate for the job that opened when Major Applewhite was dismissed Sunday after two seasons with the Cougars, will sign a five-year deal worth $20 million, according to The Athletic's Bruce Feldman and SB Nation's Steven Godfrey, who first reported the agreement. That would make him the highest-paid coach outside a Power Five conference ever, earning $1.4 million more than Mike Norvell did at Memphis in 2018 ($2.6 million). However, official details of Holgorsen's contract have not yet been officially released. Holgorsen was paid $3.7 million in salary this past season at West Virginia.

Yâall want to go win some games?



Letâs go win some games!



Help us welcome Coach Dana Holgorsen to H-Town! #GoCoogs pic.twitter.com/rhZyjtc5xL â Houston Football (@UHCougarFB) January 2, 2019

Holgorsen is 61-41 in his time at WVU and has led the program for its entire Big 12 tenure; the Mountaineers joined the conference in 2012. West Virginia generally hovered between 7-8 wins under Holgorsen, though it posted a 10-3 campaign in 2016 that netted a second-place finish in the Big 12. Holgorsen previously served as offensive coordinator at Houston under Kevin Sumlin from 2008-09.

Here's what you should know about the hire and what it means for Houston, Holgorsen and West Virginia ...

This is a good move for both parties. I've long held the belief that 2018 would be Holgorsen's last season at West Virginia for one reason or another. He's been there eight years, which in today's coaching world is an eternity. Only the legendary Don Nehlen won more games in Morgantown. Holgorsen, who is indisputably a brilliant offensive mind, is a fan of the Houston area. Having worked there in the past as a coordinator, he'll fit right in. Framing this move as a step down from the Power Five to Group of Five is missing the point; Holgorsen is going from a remote location that produces few Division I recruits and forces him to cast a wider net to freaking Houston. Texas, and Houston in particular, may be heavily mined for recruits, but Holgorsen will have a much easier time getting locally sourced high school players there -- especially quarterbacks.

That being said, Holgorsen was not without his shortcomings, a list of which would get away from the big picture. The reality is this team was Holgorsen's best team and he went 8-3 in the regular season, dropping his final two games vs. Oklahoma State and Oklahoma, the former of which was an absolute gut punch for the program's Big 12 Championship Game hopes. This past season always had a ""if not now, then when?"" vibe to it and the Mountaineers came up short. Holgorsen won 10 games twice, one of which came in his inaugural season. Granted, West Virginia can be a tough place to win, but failing to maximize its small window for something great put a lot of stress on this partnership. It was time for both sides to move on, especially with an obvious rebuild ahead.

However, Holgorsen isn't escaping pressure, he's arriving for another round of it. The only thing Holgorsen bought with this move is more time. Had he returned to West Virginia in 2019 without a contract extension, which was extremely likely if he did return, Holgorsen maybe would have survived another year or two barring a pleasant surprise. Athletic director Shane Lyons did not hire Holgorsen and given the disappointment of this past season was understandably not incentivized to reward him.

Houston was incentivized and that's great for Holgorsen, but by no means does this make his job easier. The university's president quite literally said in 2016 that the school would fire coaches for going 8-4. That's exactly what Holgorsen did in 2018 and his 15-10 record in the past two seasons is identical to Applewhite's record in two full seasons with the Cougars. And Houston is paying Holgorsen way more money than it did for Applewhite. This may be a good fit for Holgorsen, but a job is only as good as its bosses and Houston has high expectations for him with a trigger finger to boot.

Where does West Virginia look next? No, it's not Rich Rodriguez. It's not Butch Jones, either. West Virginia may not be an amazing job, but it doesn't need to hire a retread who left unceremoniously 11 years ago, nor a former assistant who drove Tennessee into the ground. It can do better and there are good enough candidates out there to not have to seriously consider either. So to whom should Lyons look?

De JesÃºs, Staff Photographer Photo: Marie D. De JesÃºs, Staff Photographer Image 1 of / 50 Caption Close Community remembers 'Princess Jazmine' at funeral service 1 / 50 Back to Gallery

The pint-sized casket was adorned with purple and white flowers, with the words âPrincess Jazmineâ sewn into the fabric.

Hundreds of mourners wore purple â Jazmine Barnesâ favorite color.

And the pews were filled at The Community Faith Church Tuesday as family, friends, dignitaries and perfect strangers turned out to remember a young life cut short by a gunman who apparently mistook her family for someone else.

Her mother, LaPorsha Washington, her voice raw from tears, read a missive she said was 7-year-old Jazmine speaking from Heaven.

âThere are no more tears, pain and sadness, just eternal love,â Washington told the congregation. âDo not be unhappy just because I am not by your side.â

In a case that sparked international outrage, Jazmine was gunned down in her motherâs car about 7 a.m. on Dec. 30 as they drove with her three sisters in northeast Harris County. The dogged manhunt began with a description of a white man seen in a red pickup truck amid growing tensions that the shooting had been racially motivated.

But by the time the funeral began Tuesday, two black men â including one suspected gang member â had been charged with capital murder in the shooting. Investigators said the men apparently thought they were aiming at a group with whom they had an altercation hours earlier.

Washington led the lengthy procession of family into the sanctuary on Pinemount Drive before the service. Jazmineâs father, Christopher Cevilla, followed soon after as gospel music spilled into the hallway.

Cevilla offered his own tribute to his daughter, whom he referred to as âmy baby girl.â

âGod bless me and my family, my angel,â Cevilla said. âHe saw it fit to take her back to heaven. Her job here was done. She brought so much peace and unity to us.â

James Barnes, who helped raise Jazmine with her mother, also offered brief words during the service.

âIâve cried for days. Iâve stayed awake for days,â he told mourners.

Among those attending the funeral were Mayor Sylvester Turner, U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee and Sheriff Ed Gonzalez, whose investigators led the charge in finding Jazmineâs killer.

Gonzalezâs condolences during the funeral came as a capital murder charge was lodged against the second man in Jazmineâs death. His vows to bring Jazmineâs attackers to justice prompted applause from the packed church.

âJazmineâs life mattered,â Gonzalez said.

The case, he said, was especially difficult for him and his investigators because it meant mourning âa life that may have been.â

âHer beautiful smile brought memories of our own children when they were second graders,â Gonzalez said, recalling her aspiration to be a school teacher. âShe was robbed of her dreams. This is our chance to make our community safer for children.

âThis is our pledge to Jazmine: Rest in peace, sweet Jazmine, for justice has been done.â

The mayor spoke of the random nature of Jazmineâs death.

âEven when itâs mistaken identity, the consequences can be deadly,â Turner told those gathered in the church. âWe all have to take a look at ourselves and change our behavior because Jazmine was an innocent. She was blameless.â

Sheldon ISD Superintendent King Davis shared memories from Jazmineâs second grade teacher at Monahan Elementary.

âJazmine had a sweet spirit,â he said. âShe loved everyone and always wanted to love and take care of others. She enjoyed making pictures for her teacher and friends.â

The funeral â which was open to the public â also brought Valencia Mason, who didnât know Jazmine or her family, from Humble. Her 5-year-old niece, Jannice Mason, joined her to support the family.

âSheâs the age of my niece,â Mason said, holding the childâs hand. âThat touched me. It could have been any one of us.â

The shooting inspired an outpour of donations, with more than $82,000 going to a GoFundMe page Cevilla established and Houston Texans wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins promising his $29,000 gameday paycheck to help the family.

The funds, and any future donations, are slated for the Jazmine Barnes Education and Scholarship Fund at Frost Bank on West Loop South in Bellaire, said Bishop James Dixon, who presides over The Community of Faith Curch.

The fund will help educate Jazmineâs siblings, he said.

A $100,000 reward compiled by civil rights activist Shaun King to encourage tipsters has not been distributed, according to Dixon. He said King and lawyer Lee Merritt did not attend the funeral.

A tip that helped apprehend the suspects was sent to King and then emailed to Gonzalez last week.

A capital murder charge was filed late Saturday against Eric Black Jr., 20, who told investigators he was the driver but did not fire the shots. A capital murder charge was filed against a separate suspect, Larry Woodruffe, 24, who has been jailed on a drug charge since Saturday.

Jazmine was in the back seat of a car when a gunman opened fire on them from another vehicle. One of the bullets struck her in the head as the family approached a Walmart. Her mother was struck in the arm, and was still wearing a sling on her left arm at the funeral. Two of the other girls were injured by flying glass.

After the service, and as the casket was carried out, Washington sobbed into the arms of Jazmineâs grandmother, who earlier collapsed with grief during the viewing. She was ushered out.

The family gathered outside the church with mourners to release more than a dozen purple balloons in Jazmineâs memory. One of the balloons nearly escaped from the cluster â a signal, her mother said, that Jazmine was anxious to set them free.

âAmen,â said Dixon, the bishop.

A Houston activist said he believes the deadly shooting of 7-year-old Jazmine Barnes just days before the new year was racially motivated.

Activist Deric Muhammad, who stood outside a Harris County Sheriff's Office substation in Wednesday's cold and damp morning hours, said Jazmine's murder could be connected to a shooting in the same area during Hurricane Harvey.

Jazmine was riding in the backseat of her family car along the East Beltway 8 feeder road near Wallisville Road on Sunday morning.

The shooter seemingly targeted the girl's family â her mother and three siblings, ages 6, 13 and 15 â at random as they made their way to a nearby Walmart.

ON HOUSTONCHRONICLE.COM: Harris County intensifies search for killer of 7-year-old Jazmine Barnes

The family never made it to the store, Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said. As far as investigators know, the family did nothing to spark the gunman's ire and he made no attempt to communicate before opening fire around 6:50 a.m. from the next lane over.

Detectives with HCSO's homicide division said the shooter was a white male with a beard driving a red pickup truck. The vehicle was spotted by security cameras nearby.

An outcry of support started pouring in from all around the country, including from nationally known civil rights activist Shaun King â who propped up a $50,000 cash reward to help catch Jazmine's killer.

""We must find the evil coward who murdered 7-year-old Jazmine Barnes,"" King tweeted along with a video of the young girl. ""We must. We have some leads already, but they aren't good enough. Keep pushing.""

Muhammad said he believes he and several other activists have a lead of their own on the case, which revolves around a shooting on Aug. 30, 2017, in the same vicinity.

During that shooting, then-21-year-old A'vonta Williams was driving along Garrett Road near East Beltway 8 to go check on his girlfriend in the wake of Hurricane Harvey when he was shot by a white male in a Ford F-150.

Williams was struck in both legs, and his grandmother, who was also in the car with him, was shot in the hip.

Williams' family claimed that detectives failed to investigate the shooting for months but have yet to make an arrest in the case.

""If A'vonta Williams' shooter had been found, would Jazmine Barnes still be alive?"" Muhammad said. ""... What are the odds that two black families were fired upon by a white male in a pickup truck within a one-year time span on the same block? We've got to call it what it is. Black people are being targeted in this country. Black people are being targeted in this county. Black people are being targeted in this city. We are thoroughly convinced that the killing of Jazmine Barnes was race related.""

Williams shooting and Jazmine's shooting happened about six miles apart.

The only connections Muhammad made between the shootings were that both shooters were white males who shot black victims in that area of Harris County, which he claimed has ""a very strong white supremacist element"" in the area.

He also noted that both shooters were driving pickup trucks, although Jazmine's shooter was behind the wheel of a red four-door pickup while Williams' shooter was driving a gray pickup.

Anyone with information about Jazmine's shooter is urged to call Houston Crime Stoppers at 731-222-TIPS (8477).

HUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) â A 61-year-old Texas inmate was executed Wednesday evening for killing a Houston police officer more than three decades ago.

Robert Jennings received lethal injection for the July 1988 fatal shooting of Officer Elston Howard during a robbery at an adult bookstore that authorities said was part of a crime spree.

As witnesses filed into the death chamber, Jennings asked a chaplain standing next to him if he knew the name of the slain officer. The chaplain didnât appear to respond, and a prison official then told the warden to proceed with the punishment.

âTo my friends and family, it was a nice journey,â Jennings said in his final statement. âTo the family of the police officer, I hope yâall find peace. Be well and be safe and try to enjoy lifeâs moments, because we never get those back.â

Outside the prison, more than 100 officers stood vigil. And a motorcycle club that supports police revved their engines, with the roar from the bikes audible in the chamber.

Jennings was pronounced dead at 6:33 p.m., 18 minutes after the drug started. He became the first inmate put to death this year both in the U.S. and in Texas, the nationâs busiest capital punishment state.

âJustice has been rendered and my family can finally have the closure we deserve,â Michael Agee, Howardâs nephew and a current Houston officer, said after watching Jennings die.

Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo, asked about the 30-plus years between the crime and the punishment, said he thought âjustice delayed is, to an extent, an injustice continued.â

âBut when the state takes a life, there has to be a process,â Acevedo said. âIn this case, the day of reckoning is here. Itâs a solemn occasion. For us itâs a celebration of a life well-lived by Officer Howard. Weâre a family. Thatâs why weâre here.â

His attorneys had asked the U.S. Supreme Court to delay his execution, arguing Jenningsâ trial attorneys failed to ask jurors to fully consider evidence â including details of his remorse for the officerâs shooting and possible brain damage â that might have spared him a death sentence.

Jennings had received an execution stay in 2016. But the high court and lower appeals courts rejected his request to delay Wednesdayâs execution and the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles turned down Jenningsâ request to commute his sentence.

A twice convicted robber, Jennings had been on parole for about two months when prosecutors say he entered Mr. Peeperâs Bookstore with the intention of robbing the business. Since being paroled, Jennings had gone on a crime spree, committing about 10 robberies, including having already robbed the same adult bookstore 12 days before Howardâs slaying.

Officer Howard, 24, was in the middle of arresting the store clerk for operating a pornographic video arcade without a permit when Jennings shot the officer twice in the head.

Howard, who had been wearing a jacket with the words âHouston Policeâ on it, staggered for a few feet before falling to the ground, where he was shot twice more by Jennings. The clerk later testified the shooting was so quick, Howard never had a chance to unholster his gun.

Jennings was arrested hours later when he went to a Houston hospital after being shot in the hand by his accomplice, who got angry at Jennings for shooting the officer.

Joe Gamaldi, the president of the Houston Police Officersâ Union, said Jennings has spent more time on death row than Howard was alive.

Howard âwas an honorable man full of integrity who did his job. He was absolutely one of the best and he was just taken entirely too soon by this animal who murdered him in cold blood,â Gamaldi said.

After his arrest, Jennings confessed to killing Howard, telling police in a tape-recorded statement he was remorseful about what happened and would âface whatever punishment (he had) coming.â

Edward Mallett, one of Jenningsâ current appellate attorneys, said the inmateâs trial attorneys failed to present sufficient evidence of his remorse as well as his history of brain damage, being abused as a child and drug addiction. He said the trial attorneys also failed to provide an instruction to jurors that would have allowed them to give sufficient weight to these aspects of Jenningsâ life when they deliberated.

Mallett said a prior appellate attorney also failed to argue these issues in earlier appeals.

âThere has not been an adequate presentation of his circumstances including mental illness and mental limitations,â Mallett said.

Jenningsâ trial in 1989 took place just as the Supreme Court issued a ruling that faulted Texasâ capital sentencing statute for not allowing jurors to consider evidence supporting a sentence less than death.

The Texas Legislature changed the statute to address the high courtâs concerns but that took place after Jennings was convicted.

The Texas Attorney Generalâs Office called Jenningsâ claim he had ineffective lawyers at his trial and during earlier appeals âspecious,â and said appeals courts have previously rejected allegations his personal history was not adequately investigated and presented at his trial.

âMy hope is that on Wednesday (Howardâs family gets) the closure that theyâve been searching for 30 years,â Gamaldi said.

Three children, including a baby, were found shot to death at a Texas City apartment Thursday evening and the man believed responsible called police from Houston to turn himself in.

The children and a woman wounded in the shooting were found after a relative called police around 6:15 p.m. for a welfare check to the Pointe Ann Apartments in the 1200 block of 10th Street, authorities said.

The slain kids were identified as an infant girl, a toddler boy and a 5-year-old girl, according to a Texas City Police Department news release.

The woman was rushed to University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston with a gunshot wound to the head.

Texas City police spokesman Lt. Kenneth Brown said the mother is in stable condition at a hospital but is not yet able to speak to investigators. Her injuries were severe, he said.

Detectives identified 27-year-old Junaid Hashim Mehmood as a suspect in the deaths. He called police near El Dorado Boulevard and Gatebrook Drive to turn himself in, officials said.

Mehmood dialed authorities at 10:17 p.m. and identified himself as the wanted man in the news reports. He allegedly said he killed his children and tried to kill his wife, a police official said. He gave his address and said he was unarmed.

He has a rap sheet with multiple arrests in Galveston and Harris County since 2010, records show.

He was arrested for hitting a girlfriend in 2014 and served 20 days in jail for that offense. The conditions of his sentencing made it illegal for him to possession a firearm, according to court documents.

In 2015, Mehmood was arrested after shoving a family member and robbing him. He was sentenced that same year to serve three years after pleading guilty to a separate robbery charge.

Meanwhile, the investigation continued at the apartment complex, which neighbors the Texas City Police Department headquarters on 9th Ave. N. The building was roped off by authorities for several hours.

""It's a very intense scene over there. Everybody involved is either deceased or injured,"" Brown said.

Jazmine Barnes was shot in the head about 7 a.m. Sunday while her familyâs vehicle was traveling on the Beltway 8 feeder road near Wallisville Road.

The story has garnered national attention, including a $100,000 reward being offered by a New York City activist to the person who turns in the gunman.

On Thursday, sources close to the family told KPRC2âs Brandon Walker that OâNeal and Houston Senior Police Officer Kenneth Miles dropped off a cashierâs check to cover the costs of Jazmineâs funeral, which is scheduled for noon Tuesday at Green House International Church on West Greens Road.

Jazmine Barnes is seen in this undated family photo taken from a GoFundMe page that was created by her family after she was shot and killed Dec. 30, 2018.

""It touched me deeply,"" Miles said.

Miles told KPRC2 he and O'Neal talked about Jazmime's death and decided to help.

""You can just imagine if one of your children or loved ones were the victims and maybe you having helped could maybe just ease the pain of not worrying about covering that cost,"" Miles said.

Miles and O'Neal are friends. O'Neal said word of Jazmine's death devastated him.

""I just wanted to keep the pain away, trying to raise money and pay for the funeral because funerals can be quite expensive,"" O'Neal said in an interview with KPRC2.

Houston Texans wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins tweeted Thursday that he would be dedicating Saturday's playoff game to Jazmine and donating his check from the game to help the family.

""I have a 5-year-old daughter, man, so it could have been anybody in that position,"" Hopkins said.

Investigators described the shooter as a bearded white man, possibly in his 40s, who was wearing a red hooded sweatshirt. He was last seen driving a red four-door pickup.

4567,Houston,https://www.espn.com/blog/nflnation/post/_/id/291366/colts-t-y-hilton-limping-to-his-second-home-in-houston-2,"INDIANAPOLIS -- Indianapolis Colts receiver T.Y. Hilton, bum ankle and all, couldn't hold back his sly grin when talking about their playoff opponent this weekend.

""I'm going to my second home,"" Hilton said.

Hilton wasn't talking about playing in Indianapolis or in his hometown in Miami. He was referring to NRG Stadium in Houston.

The Colts, back in the playoffs for the first time since 2014, will play the Texans at NRG Stadium in a Wild Card playoff matchup Saturday (4:35 p.m., ESPN).

That stadium has legitimately been like a second home field for Hilton throughout his seven-year NFL career. He has 41 receptions for 932 yards and seven touchdowns in seven games played in Houston. In Hilton's last game in Houston -- Dec. 9 -- he had nine catches for 199 yards, including a 60-yard pass to get the Colts going in the second quarter.

""I don't know what it is, I just like playing in that stadium and now I get another chance at it,"" Hilton said Sunday after the Colts' 33-17 win against the Tennessee Titans to clinch the final playoff spot in the AFC.

How effective Hilton will be against the Texans is anybody's guess. It was on that 60-yard reception that Hilton first injured his ankle more than three weeks ago. He hasn't been healthy since, and likely won't be until at some point after the season. But he has played in every game since, missing only practice time to help try to ease the workload on his ankle.

To add to Hilton's ankle problems, he'll have one less day to rest it because the game will be played Saturday instead of Sunday this week.

""Every day of rest helps, so not having that is probably a small factor,"" Colts coach Frank Reich said.

Hilton said he aggravated his ankle on his first reception in Sunday's game against the Titans. He tried to turn quickly back toward the middle of the field before being tackled on his 18-yard gain.

""I'll be alright,"" Hilton said. ""Short week, I don't have a choice, I'll be ready.""

Hilton noticeably limped to the sideline after that play and missed a couple of snaps before returning to the game.

""I love T.Y. He's unbelievable,"" Reich said. ""In the game [Sunday] after he had that first reception and long gain. The next series he's sitting off over on the bench and I kind of look back over at him. I just want to make eye contact with him to see how he's doing. I look back and I just kind of give him a look of 'Thumbs up or a thumbs down -- are you good, are you going?' He just looks at me with a smile and nods his head like heâs going.""

Hilton finished with just two catches, his second lowest of the season, but he proved once again -- as he said earlier this season -- that his less than 100 percent is better than a lot of other receivers' 100 percent when he took a bubble screen and picked up 43 yards while basically running on one leg.

Toughing it out is the way Hilton will have to continue to play. His presence on the field causes defenses -- especially Houston's -- to respect the side of the field that he's on.

""It just gives me a comfort,"" Reich said. ""Having him out there -- and I know he's not full speed. He's far from it. Who knows what percent he is, but I just know he's fighting for every rep and every catch he can make.""",Colts' T.Y. Hilton limping to his 'second home' in Houston,auto_google,['sport_news'],[]

The Rams are in the NFL title game for the first time since falling to the Patriots in 2002. Los Angeles also made Super Bowl appearances following the 1979 and 2000 seasons.

The Patriots are in the Super Bowl for the third consecutive year, fourth time in the past five years and for the ninth time overall in the Bill Belichick-Tom Brady era.",Super Bowl teams now in Atlanta,auto_google,['sport_news'],[]
4569,Atlanta,https://patch.com/georgia/atlanta/super-bowl-generate-190-million-spending-atl,"ATLANTA -- According to PwC US, Super Bowl LIII is expected to generate about $190 million in direct spending throughout the Atlanta metro area by the NFL businesses, visitors, and media. The Super Bowl is set for Sunday, Feb. 3, 2019, at Mercedes-Benz Stadium and will host the Los Angeles Rams against the New England Patriots.

""Atlanta's sports landscape has transformed over the past few years,"" said Mike Keenan, PwC sports practice leader."" With the development of Mercedes-Benz Stadium and SunTrust Park and renovation to State Farm Arena, Atlanta has re-emerged as a special events destination capable of hosting not only its recurring calendar of activity, but rotations of the country's most high-profile sporting events.""

Mercedes-Benz Stadium hosted the College Football Playoff National Championship in 2018 and in addition to the Super Bowl in 2019, will host the NCAA Final Four in 2020.

""This year's participating Super Bowl teams are another consideration unique to this year's event which factors into our proprietary analysis,"" Keenan said. ""The Patriots are playing in their ninth Super Bowl since 2002 and the regularity of having their team in the big game could cause fewer Patriot fans to travel to this year's event. The Rams, on the other hand, are the first LA-based football team to play in the Super Bowl in 35 years and their growing fan base may travel to watch a rematch of the 2002 Super Bowl where the St. Louis Rams were defeated by the Patriots in Tom Brady's first Super Bowl appearance.""



""Atlanta is a city deeply committed to advancing the socioeconomic opportunities for those that proudly call it home,"" said Crawford Pounds, managing partner for PwC's Southeast Market. ""With a new stadium and significant development to many of the city's neighborhoods since Atlanta last hosted the Super Bowl, the economic impact that comes with the game will further invigorate community growth and allow us to continue improving the lives of those that touch the city.""

4570,Atlanta,https://sports.yahoo.com/atlanta-mayor-responds-criticism-saying-anybody-saints-super-bowl-215509191.html,"Thereâs nothing wrong with a sports rivalry, as long as it doesnât cross the line. And the New Orleans Saints and Atlanta Falcons have a great rivalry.

Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said about the possible participants in Super Bowl LIII, which will be held in Atlanta, that she wanted âanybody other than the Saints.â

Well, yeah. Maybe there are some stray Saints fans living in Atlanta, but presumably everyone else in Atlanta agrees with the mayor. It was a little odd for a politician to say that before welcoming the world to her city for the Super Bowl, but it wasnât wrong. In fact, fans in New Orleans probably respected it, in a way.

Nevertheless, she had to explain Wednesday that it was a joke, like most sane people didnât know that already.

Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms had a message for Saints fans who might be coming to Super Bowl LIII, if New Orleans wins the NFC. (AP)

Atlanta mayor: âAnybody other than the Saintsâ

Here was Bottomsâ initial comment, made to Terrell Thomas of These Urban Times. And extra credit for the callback to the Saintsâ âbountygateâ scandal.

âJust anybody other than the Saints. I know thereâs going to be a bounty on my head for saying that,â Bottoms said. âBut, if it canât be the Falcons, then hey, as long as itâs not the Saints then I am happy.â

And, proving that New Orleans understands where she was coming from, New Orleans City Councilman Jay Banks shot back and referenced the Falcons blowing a 28-3 lead to the Patriots in Super Bowl LI.

âIâm sorry she feels that way. We would welcome them here,â Banks told the New Orleans Advocate. âAt the end of the day they shouldnât be mad at us that they suck.

âItâs not our fault that they choked.â

If you canât appreciate the back-and-forth, you likely arenât a sports fan. But Bottoms, being a politician, had to clarify her comments.

Atlanta mayor welcomes all fans, even Saints fans

Bottoms joked at the start of a press conference that she needed âextra security because of these New Orleans fans that I seemed to have offended.â

Story continues

âSo before we get to the real stuff, let me explain: it was a joke,â she said, according to WWL. âBut I donât know of a Falcons fan who wants to see New Orleans and the Patriots in the Super Bowl.â

Bottoms then said she was thankful for everyone who would come to Atlanta for the Super Bowl. Even Saints fans.

The possibility of the Saints invading Atlanta for a Super Bowl, and even using the Falcons facilities for the week as NFC champs, is a fun twist to the old rivalry. Bottoms has nothing to explain; we all know who Atlanta will be rooting for in the Super Bowl if the Saints win on Sunday.

4571,Atlanta,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-football-nfl-nep-brady/brady-sees-great-early-signs-from-patriots-in-atlanta-idUSKCN1PN2X5,"Tom Brady, preparing to start his record-stretching ninth Super Bowl on Sunday, knows positive signs when they appear.

And after two sleeps at the J.W. Marriott in Atlanta, the 41-year-old quarterback loves what he sees from the New England Patriots.

It started Monday night, when tight end Rob Gronkowski broke into spontaneous dance moves during Opening Night introductions at State Farm Arena.

Brady said Gronkowskiâs gyrations should give everyone associated with the Patriots âa good feeling.â

âI was standing right next to him and he was having a good time, which tells me a lot of good things,â Brady said of Gronkowski, who was not available to media Tuesday afternoon. âIt means heâs feeling good, and heâs excited. I think we should all be happy about that.â

The next sign Brady needs to see: execution at practice. The Patriots will be on the field Wednesday at Georgia Tech University.

âHaving a good practice gives you confidence â all of those things are going come up on Sunday,â he said.

Brady is well-practiced when it comes to the Super Bowl. While the Patriots are playing for a Lombardi Trophy for the third consecutive season, the experience is still novel for a handful of players on the roster. Brady is sharing his advice in-house.

âItâs a long game, a lot of timeouts, a lot of breaks,â Brady said, adding he will encourage players to spend Saturday searching out rest and reminding families on hand the one remaining day of the season is by far the most critical.

For Brady, weekend distractions are not an issue.

His family will arrive Thursday, when the Patriots host a family meal and help players set priorities for the two remaining days of preparation: a Friday practice and Saturday walkthrough.

âI know what I need to prioritize,â Brady said. âNothing really gets in the way of that. Iâm not really going out at night.â

Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels said the reason Brady is still playing at a high level is no one expects more from Brady than Brady himself. Practice and game day are not dramatically different in terms of Bradyâs level of intensity.

When asked to identify the best things about the season the Patriots will close the book on this week, Brady didnât discuss the dramatic overtime win at Kansas City or any other victory.

âIt was nice this season with no injuries to be a full-go at practice,â he said.

McDaniels was willing to point out Brady is one of the best âin the history of the gameâ at getting rid of the ball quickly. Brady said he will be mindful of getting the ball out of his hand Sunday against likely NFL Defensive Player of the Year Aaron Donald and his sidekick at defensive tackle, Ndamukong Suh.

âThis is a really unique defense,â Brady said, with a wry grin. âItâs going to take our best game.â

Patriots fans are beyond looking for positive signs in Brady. His 5-3 record in the Super Bowl includes wins in 2002, 2004, 2005, 2015 and 2017. The losses, to the New York Giants (twice) and last year against the Philadelphia Eagles, provide âmental scar tissue,â the type of endemic Brady uses as fuel.

But if New England fans needed a morsel of optimism on Tuesday, it could be found in a wide-open and relaxed Brady sharing stories about snapping a golf club, punching a hole in the wall and smashing a video game controller in what turned into a spontaneous Ask Me Anything style session with a couple hundred members of the media and cameramen.

âMust be a big game,â he said to start the festivities.

However, Brady, trained under tight-lipped head coach Bill Belichick, wanted no part of the âGOATâ questions again Tuesday.

âFootball is a team sport,â he said.

Even so, a win over the Rams would put New England, Brady and Belichick on a plane all their own, peerless and unparalleled by the most legendary winners in the sport.

âHeâs a great quarterback,â Belichick said of Brady. âIâd certainly put him up there against anybody. I donât think itâs my job to rate anyone. His record is unmatched and Iâm glad that heâs my quarterback.â

At a time when the worldâs busiest airport has its biggest crowds, there were at least six security lanes closed at domestic terminal security checkpoints, while passengers waited in lines that stretched through the terminal and were winding through baggage claim.

Wait times could reach as long as an hour and a half.

The long lines signaled staffing shortages at security checkpoints, as TSA officers have been working without pay since the federal shutdown began Dec. 22.

Airport officials normally advise travelers to get to the airport two hours before domestic flights, but on Monday morning Hartsfield-Jackson spokesman Andrew Gobeil advised that travelers should consult with their airlines. Travelers may need to get to the airport even earlier due to the long waits.

4573,Atlanta,https://www.ajc.com/news/traffic/update-stuck-train-continues-disrupt-marta-service-atlanta-airport/3HCMEzTsDvS1dJ5SxPIIEK/,"A train derailment that disrupted MARTA service near Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport left some passengers in a foul mood and wondering whether the transit agency will be ready for the Super Bowl in just a few weeks.

Normal MARTA rail service to Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport may not resume until Thursday because officials need to bring in a crane to lift a derailed train that has been sitting on the tracks since Tuesday, officials said.

âThe current plan is to uncouple the 4 working cars from damaged set of cars while ensuring employee safety and avoiding damage of vehicles.ââ Dave Springstead, Chief of Rail Operations â MARTA (@MARTASERVICE) January 16, 2019

The mishap and other delays in the transit system throughout the day left some passengers frustrated. Some felt the problems reflected poorly on MARTA as Atlanta prepares to host hundreds of thousands for the Feb. 3 Super Bowl at Mercedes-Benz Stadium.

âItâs less than three weeks until the Super Bowl, and this is a major problem for MARTA,â said Angelo Go, whose trip to work Wednesday morning was delayed more than half an hour. âDerailed trains aside, I expect them to run this system much more efficiently.â

During an afternoon press conference, MARTA rail operations chief Dave Springstead said crews hope to remove four working cars from the âdamaged set of cars, while ensuring employee safety and avoiding damage of vehicles (parked below the track). ... Our expectation is to have the crane work done tomorrow.â

The crane is scheduled to arrive at sunrise, MARTA spokeswoman Stephany Fisher told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. However, itâs not clear what time Thursday full service will be restored.

âOur expectation is to have the crane work done tomorrow.ââ Dave Springstead, Chief of Rail Operations â MARTA (@MARTASERVICE) January 16, 2019

According to the transit agency, the disruption started about 9 p.m. Tuesday when a train derailed just north of the Airport station. The conductor was the only person on board and was not injured.

Officials are not sure what caused the issue, which has had âminimal impactsâ on travelers to the airport.

Springstead told the AJC delays were just a few minutes, on average. But he said mechanical or other problems elsewhere may have led to further delays.

He advised passengers headed to the airport to leave 20 to 30 minutes earlier than they normally would, just in case.

âThis was unexpected. Itâs an unusual occurrence,â Springstead told the newspaper. âBut MARTA operations, MARTA police responded very quickly.â

When asked about incidents that may arise during the Super Bowl, Spingstead said that âthis situation proves MARTA is ready to respond.â

Todayâs #MARTA incident has minimal impacts on ATL travelers. Passengers traveling on MARTA from ATL to points north depart from Airport as usual.

MARTA was forced to ferry passengers between the College Park and Airport stations by shuttle and on southbound trains running on the northbound tracks.

Dozens of passengers waited for trains at College Park Wednesday afternoon. Many werenât fazed by the delays.

âYou donât need to rush to work,â said Oliver Gumbs of Atlanta, on his way to a job at the airport. âThis is why you leave home early.â

But some passengers were frustrated, including Theodore Evans of Atlanta, who was late picking up his grandson from daycare after working a construction job at the airport. He worried about having to pay daycare late fees.

âItâs a major hassle,â Evans said. âThey have problems all the time with this train system.â

Police said the man tried to steal the officer's unmarker car at a gas station.

ATLANTA (AP) â The worldâs busiest airport is experiencing long wait times to get through security just nine days before it expects 150,000 out-of-town visitors for the Super Bowl.

Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport had maximum wait times Thursday of 42 minutes, the highest of the nationâs top 42 airports, The Transportation Security Administration said in a statement Friday.

Baltimore/Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport had the second-longest wait time, of 19 minutes.

The long lines greeted passengers in Atlanta again on Friday. It was taking passengers 30 to 45 minutes to get through the main security checkpoint in the domestic terminal Friday afternoon, the airportâs website showed.

Transportation Security Administration workers are screening passengers without pay, and absence rates have soared.

In recent days, TSA has closed security checkpoints at Baltimore/Washington International; Houstonâs Bush Intercontinental Airport; and Miami International Airport.

Atlanta tourism officials say TSA workers from other cities are expected to volunteer at Atlantaâs airport for Super Bowl-related traffic. The Super Bowl is on Feb. 3.

Fans coming to see the Los Angeles Rams face the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LIII will pay thousands for game tickets, but at least they can fill up on $2 hot dogs and some $5 beers once inside Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium.

Atlanta Falcons president and CEO Rich McKay reiterated the stadium would have its ""Fan First Menu Pricing'' for the 75,000 spectators expected to attend the Super Bowl on Feb. 3. Just like at a Falcons game at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium, concessions will feature 12 popular food and beverage items -- including $5 cheeseburgers, $3 nachos with cheese, and $2 refillable soft drinks -- at lower prices than any other major professional American sports venue, plus without tax for easier concession-stand transactions.

A glance at last year's Super Bowl at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis shows a hot dog is $4 less expensive at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, and beer is $1.10 less per 20 ounces.

Increasing the prices based on the magnitude of the Super Bowl was never an option, McKay said.

""We said this in our negotiations with the SEC, the college football championship, the Super Bowl, and the Final Four ... what we basically said is every customer that comes through that door is our customer,'' McKay said in a phone interview. ""So we want to treat all those customers the same and give them the same experience in food and beverage.

""What was interesting with the SEC negotiations, [late] commissioner Michael Slive kept telling me, 'Hey, I want a provision in this contract that talks about the pricing and prohibits you from being able to raise the prices for our game.' And I said, 'Commissioner, we want the same provision.' It was interesting that we had a common goal yet two different mindsets. So we put that in the bids for all the major events, including the World Cup.' ''

Atlanta Falcons

Officials introduced the ""Fan First Menu Pricing"" when the $1.5 billion Mercedes-Benz Stadium opened in August 2017. It was a vision brought forth by billionaire Falcons owner Arthur Blank, a vision resulting in immediate success in the eyes of stadium executives. McKay said that from the last year of the Georgia Dome through the first year at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, the spending per customer went up 16 percent despite the 55 percent drop in prices.

""So that just shows you the amount of volume that took place,'' McKay said.

A meeting took place two weeks ago with concessionaire Levy to make the final preparations for the Super Bowl. One last-minute alteration was to add another walk-in cooler. There are 12 walk-in food coolers and 29 for keg storage. Fans will have more time to spend, so the stadium can't afford to run out of items. To illustrate, the stadium will have 75,000 bottled waters and 55,000 hot dogs stocked for the Super Bowl.

""Traditionally, we open the door two hours before, but for this, we'll open four hours before,'' McKay said. ""So there's no question, from a food standpoint on hot dogs, chicken tenders, whatever it may be, we're going to be well-stocked, because we know that we're going to face a high-volume event just, for no other reason, the amount of time it's going to be open.''

As for any congestion at concession stands, McKay is confident the 680 points of sale that include at least one of the items from the fan-first menu will alleviate any issues.

""It does you no good to charge $2 for a hot dog if it takes an hour to get it,'' McKay said.

McKay said it's like comparing ""apples to oranges'' in trying to break down how every single item sizes up with other stadiums. Compared with Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida -- the site of next year's Super Bowl -- a hot dog at Mercedes-Benz Stadium is $4.75 less, and beer is $2.80 less per 20 ounces.

McKay was hopeful that other franchises would introduce the lower-priced model, and they slowly have. Thirteen professional and college sports teams followed the Falcons/Mercedes-Benz Stadium lead in announcing the lowering of concession prices, including the Atlanta Hawks, Baltimore Ravens and Detroit Lions.

""The one in the NFL that really adopted a program similar to ours is the Baltimore Ravens,'' McKay said. ""And what we like is at the end of the year, in the NFL fan ratings, we finished No. 1 in all food-and-beverage categories. And from how I understand it, the Baltimore Ravens are now No. 2 in many of those categories.

""What I like about it is [the Super Bowl] gives us a chance to further tell the story nationwide. We still have people that come to our venue for their first event, and they're surprised by it. You're going to have a lot of fans coming from all different parts of the country, whether it's the two teams' fan base or it's just fans that are coming to a Super Bowl. We like the fact that No. 1, they're going to have a great experience, and No. 2, they're going to take the story back and continue to push the story.''

More NFL franchises certainly seem open to following the Falcons/Mercedes-Benz Stadium lead.

""Everybody has to study what the Falcons did,'' Kevin Demoff, CEO and executive vice president of the Rams, told ESPN. ""I think it goes beyond just cutting the prices. It's how they managed to increase volume, increase service. Their fans responded. You do the homework not only on the prices but the quality and the speed of service and the lines.

""It's a great credit to the organization and everything they did around the concession program, the hospitality, the game-day experience. The concession piece is important.

4576,Atlanta,https://www.ajc.com/sports/how-much-money-might-atlanta-united-make-from-selling-almiron/u0DCZyuC8NF3d238H6D3NP/,"How much money will Atlanta United receive once the sale of Miguel Almiron to Newcastle is complete?

The agreed-upon transfer fee hasnât been revealed.

For the purposes of this exercise, letâs split the difference between the $30 million that was Atlanta Unitedâs valuation and the $20 million Newcastle reportedly offered.

So, $25 million.

According to MLS rules:

âA club shall receive three quarters (3/4) of the corresponding transfer or loan fee revenue (including agent fees and other expenses), from any transaction involving a player that is NOT a Homegrown Player, Generation adidas Player, or player acquired via the MLS SuperDraft.

If a Designated Player is transferred or loaned, the club will receive all amounts of the transfer or loan fee revenue until it has recouped all out-of-pocket cash payments made by the club in connection to that player prior to any sharing arrangement with the League. After such recoup, the transfer or loan of the Designated Player shall be treated as any other transfer with the club receiving three quarters (3/4) of the corresponding transfer or loan fee revenue.â

So, Atlanta United reportedly paid $9 million to acquire Almiron from Lanus from Argentina in 2017. The team would recoup that cost.

It would also recoup the cost of Almironâs salary in 2017 and 2018. That is roughly $4.6 million.

The transfer fee and Almironâs salary together are $13.6 million.

The difference between $25 million and $13.6 million is $11.4 million. Atlanta United would receive 75 percent, or $8.55 million, of that total. The team must also take off Almironâs salary cap charge for past two years, which is around $750,000.

So, if Atlanta United sells Almiron for $25 million, it will receive approximately $21.4 million.

There are other fees and things associated with the acquisition and sale that arenât included, so that $21.4 million could change, but itâs a solid approximation.

4577,Atlanta,https://www.ajc.com/news/kaepernick-shadow-still-looms-nfl-biggest-game-comes-atlanta/E7ttOo5K1ECa9vim9GTxUK/,"When Maroon 5 canceled a planned press conference to discuss the bandâs upcoming Super Bowl halftime performance, this much was made crystal clear:

Despite the NFLâs efforts to move on, the controversy ignited by quarterback Colin Kaepernick and other playersâ decision to kneel during the national anthem as a way to protest racial injustice, the leagueâs reaction and the publicâs response is far from over.

Even if few league officials want to talk about it. And certainly not Maroon 5.

All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

Facing blowback from those who still havenât forgiven the NFL for how it dealt with Kaepernick and others, the band scuttled a news conference planned for Thursday.

The nationwide debate continues as the leagueâs signature event settles into one of Americaâs blackest cities, a place built thatâs on civil rights and a historic embrace of nonviolent protest.

Thereâs still speculation that Kaepernick, whose protest three years ago led to players around the league kneeling, is being blackballed. He hasnât worked as a quarterback since 2017. And thereâs a pending National Football League Players Association lawsuit against the league, alleging that team owners, influenced by President Donald Trump, conspired against him.

In May, the NFL announced that teams would be fined if all of their players did not stand for the national anthem, although it did suggest that players could stay in the locker room. But the league later abandoned the policy so they could negotiate terms with the NFLPA.

Only a handful of players, including Carolina Panther Eric Reid and Miami Dolphins wide receivers Kenny Stills and Albert Wilson, knelt during the national anthem during games this season.

NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, at his annual State of the NFL Address, touched vaguely and briefly on Kaepernick.

âOur clubs make decisions about players they want on their rosters,â Goodell said. âIf a team decides that (Kaepernick) or any other player can help their team win, thatâs what theyâll do.â

At other times during his 45 minutes fielding questions, the commissioner referred to Atlanta as âa city of milestones, a city of progressâ and âthe pillar of the civil rights movement.â

Using the grand spectacle of the Super Bowl as a backdrop, several organizations have have seized on that Atlanta history and plan some form of protest in the days leading up to the game.

It is not a new concept.

Last year, 17 activists protesting police brutality were arrested outside of U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis after blocking a light-rail line carrying Super Bowl ticket holders.

In 2000, the last year Atlanta hosted a Super Bowl, more than 100 protesters, led by the Rev. Joseph Lowery and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, protested Georgiaâs continued use of Confederate symbols on the state flag. A similar rally, against Confederate monuments, is planned for Saturday at Piedmont Park to take advantage of the publicity that will come with the Super Bowl in Atlanta.

Gerald Griggs, an Atlanta attorney and board member for the Georgia Alliance for Social Justice, said the NFL has responded poorly when given the chance to weigh in on social ills. The treatment of black men by police is one example, he said.

âThe very issue that Colin Kaepernick was highlighting is continuing to be ignored by the NFL and ultimately by the person they have chosen to align themselves with,â Griggs said.

That person is President Trump, he said. During the 2017 season, Trump excoriated NFL players for taking a knee during the national anthem.

âSince the rise of President Trump, weâve seen intolerance go to a whole new level,â Griggs said. âFor the National Football League to align with that is completely against our principles of social justice and equality for all.â

Griggs said his organization will highlight the continued concern about police shootings, including the death earlier this month of 21-year-old Jimmy Atchison, who was shot by an Atlanta police officer. Atchison was allegedly fleeing police and federal authorities who sought to arrest him on an armed robbery warrant. Griggs said Atchisonâs family, who say Atchison was unarmed and hiding in a closet when he was shot, will be at the rally.

Jamal H. Bryant, senior pastor of New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Stonecrest, has been boycotting the Super Bowl since Kaepernick took a knee and once led about 300 men to take a knee outside of M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore.

And heâs not changing his mind this year when the Super Bowl is held in his new town of Atlanta.

âBlack people in America have been played too often and too much,â he said. âAmerica was upset when Colin Kaepernick took a knee but became deathly quiet when 800,000 people didnât get a check during the furlough.â

Bryant said he plans to address the issue with a âSoup & Souls Sunday Worship Service,â followed by a Super Bowl party for the homeless community, with food and ministry.

As they prepare to perform at halftime, Maroon 5, Travis Scott and Atlantaâs Big Boi have faced withering scrutiny over their decisions to play. More than 111,000 people have signed a change.org petition, urging them to drop out of the event. Meanwhile, superstars like Rihanna and Cardi B. publicly refused invitations to perform in support of Kaepernick.

Common said this week that had he been asked to perform at the Super Bowl, he would have said no. (ALYSSA POINTER/ALYSSA.POINTER@AJC.COM) Photo: Alyssa Pointer

Rapper and activist Common, in town last week to deliver a speech on workplace diversity, said he was not âfeeling the NFL right now.â

âI believe in Kaepernick and what he stands for,â he said.

âI respect that Rihanna said she was not performing because she respects Kaepernick. That says a lot because the Super Bowl is a big stage to perform on. But your ethics, to say I canât support this, says a lot,â Common told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, adding that he would have refused an invitation to perform. âFor those performing, God bless them. Everybody has their own choice. They gotta live their lives. But I gotta stand for something.â

Atlanta native Gladys Knight, who will perform the national anthem before the game, has fought back and lobbed criticism at Kaepernickâs method of activism.

Lil Jon, who is also from Atlanta, said, âItâs rare when weâre able to showcase what we love about this city and showcase our city. I think itâs more about the city than it is anything else. The Super Bowl is the Super Bowl, but this is the city weâve grown up in, we launched our careers in and the city we live in. Itâs about showcasing everything we love about our city.â

Jermaine Dupri, who is producing a series of concerts and events this week, likened the performers to NFL player Reid, who, when he couldnât find a job in the league, filed a grievance letter against the NFL, charging collusion.

Last September, he was signed by the Panthers. He went back to work, despite the NFL not embracing kneeling as a form of protest.

âPeople tell me, âHe gotta take care of his family.â Well, what about Gladys Knight?â Dupri asked. âIâm confused on that part. If everybody cool with Eric Reid still playing football, then why is everybody so mad about somebody performing for Super Bowl? If thatâs what your job is?â

4578,Boston,https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/police-searching-for-missing-woman-last-seen-at-boston-bar/2615/,"Police say they are investigating a report of a missing woman who was last seen on Saturday night at a Boston bar.

Family members say 23-year-old Olivia Ambrose was last seen outside of Hennessy's, an Irish pub near Faneuil Hall, around 11 p.m. Saturday. She had went to the bar with her twin sister and friends.

Olivia's father, Michael Ambrose, is frantically searching for her, handing out missing person posters to do what he can.

""It's your worst nightmare,"" he said. ""I'm trying to stay busy, and I'm trying to find her.""

The Ambrose family has set up a command post inside Hennessy's and have been blanketing Olivia's picture on social media.

""It's heartbreaking, it's absolutely heartbreaking,"" Olivia's mother, Heather Ambrose, said. ""There is part of me that feels like it's not real, so it's okay, and there is part of me that just doesn't want to go to any bad place.""

Olivia is described as 5'2"" tall, with blue eyes and curly brown hair. She was last seen wearing a red corduroy dress under a long white and grey coat, and Doc Martens.

Olivia's twin sister Francesca says Olivia was last seen at Hennessy's with an unidentified male. Surveillance video shows her leaving the bar with him. The male reportedly purchased drinks with his credit card, and the family said they are working with the bar to see if they can help identify him.

""At some point she went to the bathroom, came back and met the guy, and they were talking for a while, and eventually they left together,"" Francesca Ambrose said. ""He was literally like behind us while we were dancing on the dance floor.""

Olivia Ambrose is a college graduate who just moved to Jamaica Plain a week ago, according to her family. Her family says she always calls and texts, and had an appointment Monday that she missed, so they're extremely worried.

""She was supposed to meet with her workmates on Sunday â they had a tentative arrangement â and then she had a doctor's appointment this morning, and she hasn't show up for any of those,"" said Heather Ambrose.

The family says this is totally out of character for Olivia.

Boston police confirm that there is an active investigation, but do not have any additional details. Detectives could be seen Monday night canvassing the area.

""I don't think anybody can really imagine until they go through it,"" Heather Ambrose said. ""We just want her home, that's all.""

""It's like your worst nightmare,"" Francesca Ambrose added.

An All-Star in 2016, the 34-year-old right-hander started the 2018 season late following left knee surgery and a 15-game domestic violence suspension. He made four starts and six relief appearances, went back on the disabled list in late June because of the knee, then returned in September.

Wright went 3-1 with a 2.68 ERA in four starts and 16 relief appearances. He was removed from the Division Series roster following the opener against the New York Yankees, a day after re-injuring his left knee during a workout, and had arthroscopic surgery on his left knee on Nov. 13.

Kapoor, a onetime billionaire and founder of Arizona-based Insys Therapeutics, is scheduled to go on trial in US District Court in Boston along with four former company executives on charges that they acted more like mobsters than pharmaceutical executives when they sold a brand of fentanyl, a powerful and addictive opioid.

The federal government, which has been accused of failing to hold drug companies to account for the nationâs deadly opioid epidemic, hopes to dispel that impression Monday when the first criminal trial of pharmaceutical executives who marketed a painkiller begins.

Insys Therapeutics founder John Kapoor faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted of racketeering conspiracy.

In a trial expected to last up to three months, federal prosecutors will try to convince a jury that the five defendants paid bribes and kickbacks to physicians in a nationwide racketeering conspiracy. The payments allegedly induced doctors to prescribe Subsys, an under-the-tongue fentanyl spray approved to treat severe cancer-related pain, for patients who hadnât been diagnosed with cancer.

The painkiller Subsys was approved for sale in 2012. Insys Therapeutics via New York Times

The case features several explosive allegations. Prosecutors say that Insys set up a sham âspeakers programâ to funnel cash to doctors, adjusted payments based on how many prescriptions doctors wrote, misrepresented patientsâ medical histories to dupe insurers into covering Subsys for people without cancer, and even hired a woman who was a former stripper and escort service manager as a key sales executive.

Former Insys employees, in federal whistle-blower lawsuits filed around the country, have described a macho, high-pressure sales operation in which deception was encouraged.

One former executive allegedly told sales representatives that âThe Wolf of Wall Street,â the 2013 film about a corrupt stock broker, was âthe best sales training video in history,â according to one suit.

The criminal case marks a rare instance of the government using the criminal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, to go after corporate executives. The statute was approved in 1970, chiefly to prosecute organized crime figures.

âAny time criminal RICO is applied to something that would appear to be a legitimate business or enterprise, itâs always somewhat unusual,â said Brad Bailey, a Boston criminal defense lawyer and former federal and state prosecutor who is not involved in the matter. In this instance, he said, the government wants to prove that Insysâs marketing of the painkiller was nothing less than a âtop-to-bottom fraudulent scheme.â

In contrast, lawyers for the former Insys executives are expected to argue that the case is an egregious example of government overreach. In a recent court filing, defense attorneys wrote that the prosecutors have failed to satisfy legal requirements for bringing RICO charges and want to âtar and feather [the defendants] based on drug-dealing allegations at the height of the opioid crisis.â

Prosecutors say the alleged scheme affected how some doctors prescribed Insys across the country, but the charges were brought by the US attorneyâs office in Massachusetts, which for years has played a leading role nationally in prosecuting health care fraud.

The case certainly marks a shift in how the Justice Department has treated the makers of opioid-based drugs.

Purdue Pharma, a privately held drug company in Stamford, Conn., has drawn far more criticism during the opioid epidemic, which federal officials say killed nearly 400,000 people from 1999 to 2017. But in comparison to the Insys prosecution, Purdue has been treated mildly by the government.

Owned by the Sackler family, Purdue markets OxyContin, a time-release opioid painkiller that has dominated headlines in the crisis. Purdue launched the drug in 1996 and mounted an aggressive marketing campaign to primary-care doctors, presenting OxyContin as a safe treatment for backaches and joint pain.

In fact, OxyContin â which reached blockbuster status in 2000 by achieving $1.1 billion in annual sales â was highly addictive and easily abused. When patients could no longer renew prescriptions, many turned to heroin, which is cheaper and easier to acquire on the street.

In 2007, as fatal opioid overdoses surged across the country, Purdue admitted to a felony of lying about OxyContinâs potentials for abuse and addiction, and three current and former Purdue executives pleaded guilty in Virginia to a federal misdemeanor charge of misbranding.

Purdue and the three men paid $634.5 million in fines. But no one went to jail.

As it turned out, federal prosecutors in Virginia had wanted to pursue charges that could have sent the executives to jail, according to a document made public last year. But the Justice Department balked after lobbying by lawyers on behalf of Purdue, including former New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who is now a lawyer for President Trump.

Twelve years later, Kapoor and the other four Insys defendants face decidedly higher stakes. If convicted of racketeering conspiracy, they could be sentenced to up to 20 years in prison. That would satisfy some critics of drug companies that promoted opioids.

âFor corporations to be able to kill people in their pursuit of profit and simply pay a fine is not adequate,â said Dr. Andrew Kolodny, codirector of opioid policy research at Brandeis Universityâs Heller School for Social Policy and Management. âOtherwise, it could be seen as the cost of doing business.â

Although Kolodny welcomed the prosecution, he said Insysâs marketing tactics were not that different from those of Purdue and other makers of opioid-based painkillers.

âBeing made an example of â thatâs the point of deterrence,â he said.

Kapoor is the most prominent of the five Insys defendants. A 75-year-old shaggy-haired entrepreneur who was raised in India, lives in Phoenix, and was â until recently â on Forbes magazineâs list of billionaires, Kapoor founded Chandler, Ariz.-based Insys in 1990. For more than a decade, he largely funded it out of his own pocket.

He guided Subsys to government approval â motivated, he said, by seeing his wife, Editha, suffer before she died of metastatic breast cancer in 2005.

Subsys was one of a handful of potent and highly regulated prescription fentanyl brands intended for cancer patients suffering from âbreakthrough painâ â that is, pain not quelled by doses of other opioids. Fentanyl is up to 100 times stronger than morphine, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration.

After Subsys was approved in 2012, Insys boomed. The company went public in 2013 and was the nationâs best-performing IPO that year. By 2015, revenue from Subsys had approached $500 million.

Much of that, however, was the result of criminal acts, according to prosecutors. Kapoor and his fellow defendants allegedly identified doctors who might be receptive to prescribing large amounts of Subsys. They then paid them to write prescriptions for patients who didnât have cancer but wanted pain relief, prosecutors say.

Insys is accused of disguising payoffs as speaking fees for spreading the word about the drugâs benefits.

Insys also allegedly paid the salaries of office staffers of doctors who prescribed Subsys. And the company set up an âInsys Reimbursement Centerâ in Arizona that allegedly misrepresented patientsâ histories to fool insurers, including Medicare and Medicaid, into covering the cost of the painkiller, even though most patients didnât have cancer, prosecutors say.

The four other defendants are Michael Gurry, the former vice president of managed markets; Sunrise Lee, a former regional director; Joseph Rowan, a former regional director; and Richard Simon, a former national director of sales.

Lee is a former Florida strip club dancer and onetime manager of an escort service who was hired as a sales executive despite having no academic degree, according to one of several whistle-blower lawsuits filed against Insys.

Alec Burlakoff, a former Insys vice president who pleaded guilty to a count of racketeering conspiracy in November and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors, defended her hiring, according to one of the suits, saying, âDoctors really enjoyed spending time with her and found Sunrise to be a great listener.â He added, âSheâs more of a closer.â

Earlier this month, Michael Babich, the former CEO of Insys, pleaded guilty to a count of conspiracy and a count of mail fraud for his role in the alleged scheme. He has also agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.

The criminal investigation began after several former Insys employees filed whistle-blower lawsuits that alleged executives seemed indifferent to the harm Subsys posed to patients without cancer.

One former sales representative said she was told âthese patients would not get worse as a consequence of unnecessarily taking Subsys. . . . They were already addicts and their prospects were already rock-bottom,â according to a suit filed in a federal court in California.

That same representative, who filed her complaint anonymously, said she was told to âbehave more sexuallyâ and stroke the hands of doctors while âliterally beggingâ them to prescribe more Subsys.

Doctors who wrote prescriptions for Subsys are expected to testify at trial. Itâs unclear whether the jury will hear evidence of patients who overdosed or became addicted.

Several physicians who received payoffs in exchange for writing Subsys prescriptions have been convicted elsewhere of federal charges. They include Dr. Jerrold Rosenberg, of North Providence, who pleaded guilty last year in federal court in Providence to creating false patient records and to taking more than $188,000 in kickbacks disguised as speaker fees. He was sentenced to more than four years in prison.

Insys is still in business but is focusing on developing synthetic cannabinoids. The company has undergone a âsignificant transformationâ since a new management team arrived in 2017, said spokeswoman Jackie Marcus.

A âmodestly sized teamâ still markets Subsys, she said.

BOSTON (AP) â Bruce Springsteen made an unexpected visit to a Boston pub last week.

Tommy McCarthy, owner of The Bebop, says Springsteen walked into the bar with his wife and another woman to spend some time listening to a local performer playing Friday evening. McCarthy tells The Boston Globe that Springsteen enjoyed the music and had a few drinks before he went on his way.

McCarthy says the Boss told him heâd like to stop by again sometime.

The proposal includes increasing CharlieCard rates for one-way train and bus trips by 10 and 15 cents, respectively, as well as raising the price of a monthly MBTA pass to $90, an increase of $5.50.

The hikes also hit one-way trips and nearly all monthly passes on the commuter rail. For farther trips to and from cities like Worcester, Gloucester, or Providence, monthly commuter rail passes would go up by $25 or more.

If approved, the proposed changes would be the first fare increase since 2016 â and the fourth since 2012. State law allows the MBTA to raise fares no more than 7 percent once every two years.

âWhile the MBTA continues to focus on controlling costs and growing non-fare revenue, this proposed increase, which is in line with the rate of inflation in the Boston area, is necessary for the Authority to continue making system investments to improve service,â the agency says on its website.

The MBTA is planning to hold a number of community hearings in the Boston area â as well as public meetings in Framingham, Woburn, and Boston â before the agencyâs Fiscal and Management Control Board votes on the proposal in March.

4585,Boston,https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/25879334/jenrry-mejia-agrees-deal-boston-red-sox,"BOSTON -- Relief pitcher Jenrry Mejia, allowed back into baseball after a lifetime ban caused by three positive drug tests, has agreed to a minor league contract with the Boston Red Sox.

If added to the 40-man roster, the 29-year-old Dominican right-hander would receive a one-year contract at a rate of $625,000 while in the major leagues and $90,400 while in the minors.

Mejia will report to Boston's minor league spring training camp. He has been out of the majors since July 2015.

Mejia was suspended for life on Feb. 12, 2016, after his third positive test for a banned steroid. The drug agreement allowed him to apply a year later for reinstatement that would be effective a minimum of two years after the ban started, with the decision at the commissioner's discretion. Commissioner Rob Manfred gave him conditional reinstatement last July 6, and said Mejia could return to the big leagues in 2019.

""He has been reinstated by MLB, so we are hopeful he has learned from his past mistakes,"" Red Sox president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski told the Boston Herald.

The New York Mets released Mejia on Nov. 20 rather than allow him to become eligible for salary arbitration. Mejia has four years, 140 days of major league service, and the Mets could have tried to cut his salary to $1,383,200 had he remained on the roster.

Mejia was the Mets' closer in 2014. He was suspended for 80 games on April 11, 2015, following a positive test for Stanozolol, a drug popular among bodybuilders. At the time, he maintained, ""I can honestly say I have no idea how a banned substance ended up in my system.""

Mejia returned on July 12, appeared in seven games for New York, then was banned for 162 games on July 28 after a positive test for Stanozolol and Boldenone. The third suspension was for a positive test for Boldenone, an anabolic steroid generally used by veterinarians on horses.

Mejia is 9-14 with a 3.68 ERA in 18 starts and 95 relief appearances. In addition to random drug tests, he is subject annually to six additional urine tests and three additional blood tests.

4586,Boston,https://boston.eater.com/2019/1/4/18168447/durgin-park-closing-boston-landmark,"A Faneuil Hall landmark will close this month: Durgin-Park â which has been in operation since 1827, under the Durgin-Park name since 1877 â will cease to exist on January 12, 2019.

Michael Weinstein, the CEO of Durgin-Parkâs parent company, Ark Restaurants, reportedly cited the restaurantâs inability to turn a profit as the reason for its pending shutter. However, Gina Schertzer, whoâs been working at the restaurant for 43 years as a bartender and server, told Eater she hadnât noticed a significant downturn in her tips.

âI no longer have the speed the young people do, but I can still make $50 on a deuce,â she said. âThis is about greed. Itâs all about greed.â

Schertzer says that Ark Restaurants isnât aware of how iconic Durgin-Park is and that they should have âdone their homework before buying it.â

The roots of the restaurant stretch back even farther than its opening in 1827: When Faneuil Hall Marketplace opened in 1742, a dining hall debuted in the future Durgin-Park space soon after, serving fishermen, merchants, and other businessmen. John Durgin, Eldridge Park, and John G. Chandler purchased it in 1827, and in 1877, Chandler dubbed the business Durgin-Park in honor of his business partners, who had since died. The Chandler family continued to run the restaurant until 1945.

Since then, it has passed through several hands. Up until the purchase by the Kelly family in the early 1970s, Durgin-Park had gotten a reputation for surly service; that aspect of the Durgin-Park tradition has been toned down a bit since the 1970s, but the restaurant still harks back to an earlier era of Boston dining with dishes like steamers (âsometimes sandy,â warns the menu), a New England clambake, broiled scrod, prime rib, Yankee pot roast, lobster rolls, and â of course â chowder.

Restaurant management cited a rise in minimum wage as a mitigating factor in the closure. Schertzer doesnât buy it.

âIâd like to see them live on $12 an hour, the cheap bastards,â she told Eater. âIâm 76 years old. Where am I going to go? I thought Iâd die and that restaurant would live on. And it should live on.â

Schertzer, who described herself as a grandmother to everyone at the restaurant, ultimately was concerned about her fellow coworkers.

âTheyâre putting over 100 people out of work with a weekâs notice.â

Police are investigating the death of a baby girl who was found in the restroom of an Amazon warehouse in the US state of Arizona.

Phoenix police spokesman Vincent Lewis said the newborn was reported to police at the online retail giant's facility on Wednesday evening.

Homicide detectives are working to determine if any crime was committed at the facility, he said.

Police have identified the mother, who is co-operating with the investigation.

In a press conference on Thursday, Sgt Lewis refused to publicly name her or say whether she is employed at the distribution centre.

""But, again, the restroom was located inside of a secured Amazon facility,"" said Sgt Lewis, who refused to speculate on what charges the mother may face.

He said that investigators are looking into whether the child was born in the toilet, adding that the infant appeared to have only been there briefly.

""It had been there some time,"" he said, adding, ""very recent, same day"".

""It appeared to first responders that the baby was full term, or close to that,"" the spokesman said, adding that she could not be resuscitated by medics from the city's fire department.

To read the letter, see below:

Greetings -

Today, I am happy to share with you the Phoenix Life strategy for expansion in 2019. Last year was record-breaking for us in many ways and we couldnât be more excited to enter the new year and continue to complete these important milestones ahead of us.

The first step the company is making to further its mission is the establishment of offices and infrastructure in the Oceania region including Australia and the Republic of Vanuatu. Further, this will include the recruitment of an expanded team of medical, clinical trial, agricultural and pharmaceutical personnel. I will be personally relocating to the region to spearhead the growth of Phoenix Life, and to be closer to our operations and clinical trial plans in The Republic of Vanuatu and throughout Oceania.

We believe that the many initiatives there will be expedited by expanding our offices and personnel in the region. Itâs important for us to build on the key relationships that weâve been establishing with the people and government officials within the Pacific and further cementing Phoenix Lifeâs regional and global presence to assure successful long-term partnerships.

Secondly, as announced at the end of last year, the approval for the importation of Phoenix Metabolic, our diabetes management product, has paved the way for the commencement of clinical trials in Vanuatu for the treatment and management of Type 2 diabetes. By expanding our presence in the region, we intend to expand access to these life and limb saving programs into region. According to the World Health Organization, the South Pacific contains more diabetics as a percentage of the population that any other area in the world, with limited or no access to treatment.

Following the anticipated success of these international trials, Phoenix Life intends to be able to assemble all relevant study data to support new drug applications in developed nations such as the United States, Australia and areas of Europe starting in 2020.

In building out our Global Production Capacity, weâre very excited to confirm that we are in the final stages of completing documentation and policies to acquire land to commence propagation of regional plantations for cultivating, extraction and processing of range of cannabis varieties to provide the key active ingredients for Phoenix Lifeâs full product portfolio. We are looking forward to not only begin local growing and manufacturing but most importantly giving back to our partner countries by providing local employment, education, additional revenue streams, and most importantly positive health outcomes.

Oceania and the South Pacific is very important to the cannabis industry and to us because, according to New Frontier Data, the existing cannabis market across the region is worth an estimated $5.0 billion (U.S. dollars). The cannabis market in Australia alone is estimated to be worth up to $4.5 billion (U.S. dollars) as its medical cannabis market has taken the shape of a pharmaceutical market. This is in addition to Phoenix Lifeâs diabetes program. The tropical climate of this region and its close proximity to the equator makes it ideal for organic cannabis production because of the areaâs abundance of natural sunlight and fresh spring water. These outdoor growing conditions significantly reduce the cost of infrastructure and operations, while making a year-round cultivation possible.

Lastly, as we launch our global sales organization, we are excited to bring some of the brightest minds in sales together with healthcare professionals to open up a series of country programs for clinical trials and product distribution. By including both generic medical cannabis products for doctorâs prescription as well as products designed to target and treat specific diseases like diabetes, cancer and pain, Phoenix Life has been positioned to start making a dramatic difference to the healthcare of patients in the Oceania region and globally.

Building from the success of 2018, 2019 stands to be a watershed year for Phoenix Life. We look forward to sharing many more announcements this year so please stay tuned as our company continues to thrive and grow!

We look forward to you joining us this year as we help shape the future of healthcare.

In service of Global Healthcare,

Martin Tindall

4590,Phoenix,https://www.arabnews.com/node/1431081/offbeat,"PHOENIX: Phoenix police on Saturday were investigating reports of a sexual assault after a woman who has been hospitalized in a vegetative state for the past decade gave birth.

The woman, who was incapacitated in a drowning incident, was a patient at Hacienda Healthcare when she went into labor on Dec. 29 and delivered a baby boy, according to local media. No one knew she was pregnant and health care staff were initially unsure why she was moaning, the reports said.

âThis matter is currently under investigation by the Phoenix Police Department,â Sergeant Tommy Thompson told Reuters when asked about the media reports.

Hacienda spokesman David Leibowitz said the facility had recently become aware of a âdeeply disturbing incidentâ involving one of its residents.

He declined to say whether its staff were being asked to undergo DNA testing to identify a possible suspect, or whether the facility was taking any preventative measures to protect patients against a similar situation.

âWhile federal and state privacy laws prohibit us from publicly discussing a patientâs health or case, Hacienda has and will continue to cooperate fully with law enforcement and all the relevant regulatory agencies regarding this matter,â Leibowitz said by email.

Victim advocate Tasha Menaker, chief strategy officer of the Arizona Coalition to End Sexual and Domestic Violence, said it would be appropriate for police to run DNA tests on male employees at the facility.

Hacienda HealthCare describes itself as Arizonaâs leading provider of specialized health care services for medically fragile and chronically ill infants, children, teens, and young adults as well as those with intellectual and developmental disabilities.

A spokesman for Arizona Governor Doug Ducey said the reports were âdeeply troublingâ and that the state was re-evaluating its contract and regulatory authority over Hacienda Healthcare to tighten up patient safety measures.",Phoenix police investigate after woman in coma for decade gives birth,auto_google,"['police', 'crime_incident', 'indirect_city_relation']",['Phoenix']
4591,Phoenix,https://cronkitenews.azpbs.org/2019/01/30/waste-management-phoenix-open-finding-creative-ways-to-remain-greenest-show-on-turf/,"According to Janette Micelli, external/corporate communications manager for the Waste Management open, a team of over 300 help transport and organize trash ensuring a âzero wasteâ tournament. (Photo by Tyler Rittenhouse/Cronkite News) Dubbed âthe greenest show on grass,â the Waste Management Open is proud to be known as a âzero wasteâ golf tournament. (Photo by Tyler Rittenhouse/Cronkite News) Multiple Solar Compactors have been placed in various spots of TPC Scottsdale. Compactors are utilized for larger, more dense trash than a typical water bottle. (Photo by Tyler Rittenhouse/Cronkite News)

SCOTTSDALE â Staging an event of any size that aims to reduce waste is a challenge. Organizing one of sportâs biggest spectator events while producing zero waste takes a whole different level of creativity.

The Waste Management Phoenix Open launched its Zero-Waste Challenge in 2012, and since 2013 the PGA Tour event at TPC Scottsdaleâs Stadium Course has managed to divert 100 percent of all tournament waste away from landfills.

Instead, tons of water bottles, paper plates, beer cans, food and other waste generated by the more than 700,000 fans who attend the PGA Tour event each year have been repurposed, recycled, composted, turned into energy or donated.

The effort has made the WMPO the largest zero-waste event in the world, according to the sponsoring Phoenix Thunderbirds and Waste Management, the waste collection and environmental management company in its 10th year as the tournamentâs primary sponsor. Tournament and Waste Management officials announced this week that they have extended their agreement through 2030.

However, as the tournamentâs galleries, which already are the largest on the PGA Tour, continue to grow, so does the sustainability challenge. Thatâs where the creativity comes in.

This year, the tournament popped the cork on a new initiative that aims to repurpose the thousands of empty wine bottles left behind by golf fans throughout the tournamentâs suites and hospitality areas.

Refresh Glass, a Phoenix-based company that gathers empty wine bottles from hotels, restaurants and resorts and then recycles the glass to create home dÃ©cor items and glassware, is partnering with the tournament this year. Refresh Glass has a goal of repurposing 10 million wine bottles annually.

Waste Management spokesman Rob Myers said Refresh Glass owner Ray DelMuro is arranging to gather empty wine bottles and broken glass from the tournament, transporting it to Refresh Glass and using it to make glassware and other items such as decorative candleholders.

âAfter that, he brings the items back to the tournament over the weekend to resell,â Myers said. âItâs really about closing that recycling loop.â

Part of Waste Managementâs goal at the golf tournament is to educate those who attend about the value of recycling and composting waste.

âThatâs what we do out here,â said Janette Micelli, corporate communications director for Waste Management. âHow can we creatively tell the story, and then how can we have fun with it?â

The tournament utilizes three Zero Waste Stations to provide the fun part.

The stations are repurposed trash dumpsters transformed into colorful kiosks, each with an interactive game that teaches attendees how to recycle and compost.

âI learned that utensils are compostable,â said Jennifer Villalobos, a golf spectator who visited a Zero Waste Station. âI would think that the plastic in them is recycled.â

So Villalobos, who is trying to live âgreenâ wherever possible, learned something.

âI like to have a bag where I put my recyclables, and a bag to put my trash in,â she said. âThatâs something Iâm always working on at home to make sure Iâm helping the earth and giving back to the community.

âIâm learning new things, like maybe I shouldnât put my utensils in the recycle bin anymore. And I think thatâs kind of cool.â

The Zero Waste Station closest to the tournament entrance includes an educational water feature, new this year, to teach fans the importance of conserving water. To set an example, the tournament collects and reuses all grey water from the eventâs food stands and bars, directing it to portable toilets.

There are no âtrashâ receptacles at the tournament. Instead, they are clearly labeled for recycling or composting, and there are plenty throughout the 18-hole layout.

Also, materials that are brought on site must be locally reused, recycled, or composted. Each vendor must sign a contract that requires them to use plates, napkins, and utensils that meet recycling requirements, reducing the amount of food-service waste.

âWe just hope people do the right thing, as you would anywhere,â Micelli said. âWeâre trying to inspire people to recycle more and to make sure their recycling is clean. You may not do zero waste at your home, but what can you do to think green?â

The tournamentâs efforts have not gone unnoticed. In 2017, the WMPO became the first tournament in the world certified by the Golf Environment Organization, and the tournament repeated the honor in 2018. Underwriters Laboratories verified the tournamentâs zero-waste status.

While achieving zero waste is the goal, there are some days during the tournament that are more challenging than others. Friday and Saturday crowds at the WMPO are renowned for their size and rowdiness. Thereâs only so much tournament staff and volunteers can do to limit litter. But with roughly nine waste receptacles within view from just about anywhere on the course, they are able to manage.

Lee Spivak, senior associate of Waste Management sustainability services, said the ultimate goal is to encourage and educate those who attend the tournament to make an environmental difference in their day-to-day lives.

âItâs really great to do what we can here, but then everyone leaves here and goes back to their homes and businesses,â Spivak said. âIf we can affect change in that sense, it really takes the event and grows the impact in a positive way.â

Spivak believes that with creativity and education, fans will buy in.

âIf you piss everyone off, theyâre not going to change,â he said. âTheyâre not going to want to be involved. Theyâre not going to want to try to help you. So over the years, weâve been trying to build up a culture shift, a foundation of what the norm is at this tournament.

â It doesnât work as well when you try to force it.â

Tommaso Ciampa defeated Aleister Black under controversial methods to win the NXT Championship last summer. Saturday night, Black sought both revenge and a second reign with the title as he battled The Blackheart in the main event of a TakeOver: Phoenix show that set the bar extremely high for the main roster to surpass at Royal Rumble.

Black seized the early upper hand, delivering a tope that wiped out Ciampa at ringside. A series of strikes rattled the champion, and a kick to the chest flattened him at ringside. Black's momentum came to a sudden halt when Ciampa delivered a nasty suplex that sent the challenger's knee crashing into the ring steps.

Ciampa worked the leg for several minutes, taunting his opponent by calling him a ""one-trick pony."" He wrapped the leg around the ring post, in hopes of taking his kick-based arsenal away from him.

The champion was perched atop the ropes, looking to continue his onslaught, when Black caught him with a big kick from out of nowhere that sent both men tumbling to the arena floor. Commentator Mauro Ranallo put over Black's willingness to do himself damage in pursuit of the title.

Ciampa tried for his Fairy Tale Ending finish, but Black escaped and tried for Black Mass. Ciampa cut it off with a clothesline to the back of his head. Barely stunned, Black answered with a German suplex for two. Ciampa answered with a half crab, but Black fought out and applied one of his own.

Black lost sight of Ciampa at one point, and the champion made him pay with a Tower of London on the ring apron that netted him a two-count.

An exchange of strikes unfolded, each man staggering the other with his own punch- and kick-based offense. Ciampa tried to kick the leg out from underneath his opponent, but Black caught him with a double stomp. He answered moments later with a big moonsault to the arena floor. Black slipped on water spilled on the floor, and the momentary distraction allowed Ciampa to recover and deliver the Fairy Tale Ending for a very close two-count.

Like Johnny Gargano earlier in the night, Ciampa pulled the mats up at ringside, exposing the concrete. A discussion between Ciampa and the referee allowed Black to seize an opening and deliver a double knee. Back inside, Black delivered Black Mass from out of nowhere, but an alert champion rolled onto his stomach to prevent the pin.

Ciampa delivered a DDT and a second Fairy Tale Ending, which Black kicked out of for the second time in the match. A third Fairy Tale Ending followed. Black escaped a fourth, but his knee gave out and he eventually succumbed to that fourth finisher as Ciampa successfully retained his title.

After the match, as Ciampa made his way up the ramp, Gargano appeared and stood side-by-side with his partner-turned-enemy. He raised his newly won North American Championship high overhead, as did the retaining Ciampa. As the show faded to black, Gargano shot a glance at the NXT Championship, teasing that the issues between them may not be over.

Result

Ciampa defeated Black

Grade

A

Analysis

This was completely different than everything else on the show. There were no big high spots; there was no high-flying offense that razzle-dazzled the crowd. This was a good, old-school, psychological wrestling match that told a strong story and gave Ciampa a wholly unexpected clean win to close out the broadcast.

The glare Gargano shot Ciampa at the end of the event was the most interesting part of the entire show in that it suggests their story is not over. Yes, the potential for an unholy alliance is there, but Gargano seemed to hint that, while he is happy to have his North American title, his eyes are on the NXT Championship and taking it away from the man who has made his life a living hell.

Given the quality of the story thus far, including an attention to detail unheard of from the company, it should be a damn fun ride.","WWE NXT TakeOver Phoenix Results Winners, Grades, Reaction and Highlights",auto_google,['sport_news'],[]

The Phoenix City Council approved a controversial deal with the Phoenix Suns that will keep the NBA franchise in downtown Phoenix through at least 2037.

The council voted 6-2, with Vice Mayor Jim Waring and Councilman Sal DiCiccio opposing it, to approve the $230 million deal. The city will pay $150 million from its Sports Facilities Fund, which is composed of a 1 percent tax on hotels and a 2 percent tax on car rentals.

The council added a number of tweaks to the deal, including:

Requiring the Suns to spend $10 million on community benefits (either through nonprofits or city programs), including at least $2.6 million to the city's preschool program this year.

The city will hire someone to oversee Phoenix's expenditures on the renovations.

The city will commit the $1.5 million rent increase from the Suns to homeless issues.

80 percent of any additional revenues generated by the city from the arena will go toward city public-safety costs.

Details of the deal were released to the public in December â less than a week before the council was initially supposed to vote on it. After public backlash, the council postponed the vote and hosted a series of public meetings to educate residents about the details of the agreement.

About a month ago, interim Councilwoman Vania Guevara came out against the arena deal. She said during Wednesday's meeting that she changed her mind after working with the Suns to ensure they would increase their investment in the community, notably in the city's Head Start preschool program.

Without the money, city staff had warned, the program would have to decrease the number of students it served because the city needed to raise salaries for teachers in the program to keep up with state Legislature-approved teacher raises.

After the vote, Suns owner Robert Sarver, who has faced criticism from fans, said he was glad he could demonstrate the team's commitment to the community through the donation.

He also said he believes the arena investment will be a ""win-win"" for both the team and Phoenix.

""I'm glad that we can carry on the vision that (former owner Jerry Colangelo) had and that this council had 26 years ago to get this building built,"" Sarver said.

What is the deal?

Phoenix pays $150 million for arena renovations.

Suns pay $80 million for renovations and any cost overruns.

After the renovation, Phoenix will pay $2 million annually for 12 Â½ years into a new renewal and replacement fund, which will be used for future renovation needs.

Suns will pay $1 million into the new fund for 12 Â½ years.

Suns will continue to operate and maintain the building, including booking concerts and other events.

Suns will continue to pay rent to the city (calculated as a percentage of annual proceeds).

Suns will build a new practice facility (estimated to cost $25 million to $50 million) somewhere in Phoenix.

Suns commit to staying in downtown through 2037 with an option to extend the lease to 2042. If the team leaves before 2037, it will face up to a $200 million fine.

Criticism of the deal

The council chambers were packed with residents eager to weigh in on the deal. The council allowed more than 30 people to comment before voting.

Most of the speakers, ranging from business leaders to nonprofit directors, favored the deal and spoke heartily about the Suns' community commitment.

But the deal was not without its critics.

Several individuals chided the deal as lopsided, since Phoenix will pay nearly double what the team will invest.

The internet's favorite critic, 90-year-old Greta Rogers, told the council that she had no disaffection for the Suns, but she was dismayed by the way the city negotiated the deal.

She lambasted the city for not including the public in conversations until it was too late. She also scoffed at the notion that the not-even-30-year-old building is obsolete.

""I'm three times that old and my facility's doing pretty well,"" Rogers said.

Mary Rose Wilcox shooter appears

The meeting took a bizarre turn when former Councilwoman and Maricopa County Supervisor Mary Rose Wilcox testified in favor of the renovations.

She had voted in favor of the original deals for both the Suns arena and Chase Field, where the Arizona Diamondbacks play. The latter vote resulted in a man shooting and wounding her in 1997 and claiming it was justified because of her support of sports subsidies.

About five minutes after she spoke, Larry Naman, the man who shot Wilcox and served time in prison for the offense, approached the council, admitted to shooting Wilcox, and then insisted that the council put the Suns deal up for a public vote.

He said not allowing the public to vote on the matter was the equivalent of an ""act of violence against the public.""

Naman was allowed to stay in the council chambers for the remainder of the meeting, but police officers were present. He told a 12 News reporter after the meeting that he's off parole and doesn't own a gun.

4595,Seattle,https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/cowboys-vs-seahawks-final-score-takeaways-dallas-rides-ezekiel-elliott-to-wild-playoff-win-over-seattle/,"There's a reason they call it the wild-card round, and the reason is because you get wildly entertaining games like the one played on Saturday night in Dallas.

In a game that wasn't decided until Dallas recovered an onside kick with 1:16 left to play, the Cowboys outlasted the Seahawks 24-22 for a win that will now be sending Jason Garrett's team to the divisional round next week against either the Saints or the Rams.

To pick up their first playoff win in four years, the Cowboys did what they they've done a lot of this season: They fed Ezekiel Elliott.

Elliott, who finished 2018 as the NFL's leading rusher with 1,434 yards, slowly wore down the Seahawks defense on a night where he carried the ball 26 times for 137 yards and a touchdown. Elliott tends to shine in the fourth quarter, and that's exactly what he did against Seattle.

With just 7:20 left to play and the Cowboys clinging to a 17-14 lead, Dallas needed to put together a time-consuming drive, and so they decided to feed Zeke. On an 11-play drive that ran 5:12 off the clock and essentially iced the game, Elliott carried the ball five times for 31 yards. The Seahawks could only watch as precious seconds ticked away after each one of Elliott's carries.

Elliott's performance on the drive set up Dak Prescott for a one-yard score that proved to be the game-winning touchdown.

Although Elliott came up big on that fourth quarter drive, he did most of his damage in the first half, when he carried the ball 13 times for 91 yards. One of the biggest plays of the game came on a third-and-1 for the Cowboys with just 1:09 left to play until halftime. At the time, Dallas was trailing 6-3 and If they didn't convert the third down from their own 34-yard line, they would have had to punt the ball back to Seattle.

Not only did Elliott get the one yard for the first down, but he also tacked on 43 more yards to set the Cowboys up at the Seahawks' 22-yard line.

The run was pivotal because it gave the Cowboys a chance to get a touchdown right before halftime. With just 24 seconds left to play in the second quarter, Prescott hit Michael Gallup for a score that put the Cowboys up 14-10 at the half.

Prescott wasn't perfect in this game, but he did more than enough to keep the pressure off Elliott. Not to mention, the Cowboys quarterback came through when the team needed him the most. In a play that basically saved the win for the Cowboys, Prescott converted a third-and-14 by pulling off a miraculous 16-yard run with under 2:45 left to play in the game.

Overall, Prescott rushed for 29 yards to go along with his 226-yard passing performance.

If the Cowboys win the Super Bowl, they might want to send a ring to Jon Gruden, and that's because most of Prescott's passing yardage went to former Raiders receiver Amari Cooper. Cooper continued to come up big for the Cowboys and this time, he did it with a seven-catch, 106-yard performance that included the 34-yard reception you can see below.

That catch, which came in the fourth quarter, set up a one-yard touchdown run by Elliott that gave the Cowboys the lead for good at 17-14.

The Cowboys' new version of the triplets seems to be catching fire at the right time, and there's no reason to think that this team can't upset either the Saints or the Rams next week.

Dallas D puts clamps on Seahawks run game

During the 2018 season, the Seahawks led the NFL in rushing with 160 yards per game, but they got nowhere close to that number in Dallas. Going up against a relentless Cowboys defense, the Seahawks were only able to muster 73 yards on 24 carries. The numbers are actually even uglier than that if you consider that 28 of those yards came on one carry, which means that Seattle gained just 45 yards on their 23 other rushes (1.96 yards per carry).

Seahawks running back Chris Carson, who finished the season with 1,151 yards, had nowhere to run. At halftime, he had just 16 yards and he was only able to tack on four more in the second half. Cowboys linebacker Leighton Vander Esch, who's a strong Defensive Rookie of the Year candidate, was all over the field with 10 tackles. One key part of the Seahawks rushing attack is Russell Wilson, but he was mostly ineffective thanks to a perfectly designed defensive strategy from the Cowboys. For most of the game, the Cowboys had a shadow on Wilson to prevent the Seahawks quarterback from doing any damage with his legs, and the plan worked, because Wilson only rushed for 17 yards.

Seahawks help stop the Seahawks

Although the Cowboys deserve a lot of credit for shutting down the Seahawks offense, they also got some help from Seahawks offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer, who seemed lost calling plays. For the most part, the Seahawks spent the game running on first and second down, then hoping that Russell Wilson could bail them out on third down.

The problem for the Seahawks is that kind of offensive strategy just doesn't work when you're playing a defense as good as the Cowboys. Although Wilson had an impressive night (18 of 27, 233 yards, one touchdown), none of his magic was working on third down with the Seahawks going just 2 of 13 on third down conversions.

Schottenheimer's obsession with sticking with something that wasn't working (the run game) didn't make any sense, and that's mostly because Wilson came up huge when he was actually allowed to throw. For instance, the Seahawks quarterback single-handedly kept his team in the game when he converted a fourth-and-6 in the third quarter with this perfect throw to Doug Baldwin.

The crazy thing is that Wilson was making throws like that all game. The Seahawks quarterback would put the ball where only his receiver could get it, and then his receiver would make a huge play. Here's a look at a 25-yard pass that Tyler Lockett caught in the second quarter.

Schottenheimer's desire to stay with a run game that absolutely wasn't working turned the Seahawks into a one-dimensional team that the Cowboys easily shut down. Lockett, who caught four passes for 120 yards, was one of the few bright spots for the Seahawks offense.

Home-field advantage is alive and well at Jerry World

Although Seattle is known as a tough place to play, it's the Cowboys that have actually had one of the best home-field advantages in the NFL this year. Dallas finished the regular season with a 7-1 record at Jerry World, which was tied for the best home record in the NFC. The Cowboys asked their fans to wear white on Saturday to match the team's white uniforms, and let's just say, the fans in Dallas came through.

Everyone loves to joke about Cowboys fans being bandwagon jumpers, but the fact of the matter is that this fan base has stood by the organization for nearly 25 years even though the Cowboys haven't come anywhere close to sniffing a Super Bowl since 1995. You could tell the fans in Dallas were eager to see the win on Saturday, and they came out in full force to AT&T Stadium to give the Cowboys a true home-field advantage against the Seahawks.

The Cowboys could actually end up hosting one more game this postseason, but that would only happen if they end up playing the Eagles, which means the Cowboys would need Philadelphia to somehow put together another magical playoff run. If the Eagles and Cowboys meet in the NFC Championship, the game would be played in Dallas on Jan. 20.

Allen Hurns carted off after gruesome injury

The Cowboys lost Allen Hurns for the night after he suffered an ugly injury midway through the first quarter. The injury happened after Hurns caught a big 14-yard pass on a third-and-7 play for the Cowboys. As Hurns was fighting to get a few more yards, he got hit by Seahawks safety Bradley McDougald, who came down on the receiver's left ankle. In what can only be described as one of the most gruesome injuries you'll ever see, McDougald's body weight snapped Hurns' ankle. The game had to be stopped for nearly 10 minutes so trainers could take care of Hurns and get him carted off the field.

The good news is that Hurns was able to give a thumbs up before he was taken off the field.

Cowboys owner Jerry Jones revealed after the game that Hurns immediately underwent surgery after leaving the stadium. According to Jones, Hurns dislocated his ankle and fractured his knee.

Kicker problems

One storyline that was hanging over the second half of this game was the health of Sebastian Janikowski. The Seahawks kicker injured himself while attempting a 57-yard field goal at the end of the first half, and by the start of the third quarter, he had been ruled doubtful to return before eventually being ruled out. That left the kicking duties to Seahawks punter Michael Dickson, who isn't exactly known for his ability to placekick.

Um, if this comes down to a field goal, the Seahawks might be in trouble. #SEAvsDAL #Cowboys #Seahawks pic.twitter.com/g4Iolwq1FB â John Breech (@johnbreech) January 6, 2019

Dickson was missing field goals left and right during his halftime warm-up, and apparently, things were so bad that Pete Carroll decided not to attempt any kicks in the second half.

The Seahawks scored two touchdowns in the second half and after each score, Carroll decided to go for two (the Seahawks scored on both conversions). Although Dickson wasn't forced to try a game-winning field goal, he did kill any chances Seattle had of winning when botched the onside kick with 1:16 left to play. Someone must have forgotten to tell Dickson that an onside kick only needs to go 10 yards, because he sent it more than 30 yards down the field.

Worst onside kick ever of all time pic.twitter.com/2Ol4FiulXW â Barstool Sports (@barstooltweetss) January 6, 2019

The big kick was good news for Cole Beasley, who made the easiest onside recovery of his life.

Up next

Although the Cowboys will definitely be playing in the Divisional Round next week, they won't find out who they're playing until after the Eagles-Bears game on Sunday. If the favored Bears come away with the win, then the Cowboys will be headed for New Orleans in a game that would be played on January 13. This will be a rematch of a Week 13 game played in Dallas where the Cowboys upset the Saints 13-10. On the other hand, if the Eagles pull off the upset in Chicago, then Dallas will be headed to Los Angeles for a Saturday night showdown with the Rams.

As for the Seahawks, their season is now over, which means they can start focusing on things like the combine and free agency. The Seahawks can also turn their eyes to the draft. Since they were eliminated in the wild-card round, the Seahawks will pick either 21st or 22nd during the first round of the 2019 NFL Draft.

4597,Seattle,https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/25694182/sebastian-janikowski-seattle-seahawks-ruled-game-thigh-injury,"ARLINGTON, Texas -- Seattle Seahawks kicker Sebastian Janikowski suffered a thigh injury while attempting a field goal on the final play of the first half and was ruled out for the rest of Saturday night's 24-22 wild-card loss to the Dallas Cowboys.

With Janikowski out, the Seahawks attempted successful two-point tries on their only two touchdowns of the second half, and had rookie punter Michael Dickson handle the ensuing kickoffs. They converted a fourth-and-5 from the Dallas 39-yard line before the first of those two scores -- a Russell Wilson 4-yard touchdown run -- though they might have been in four-down territory there even with a healthy Janikowski.

Seattle coach Pete Carroll said Janikowski's absence forced Seattle to adjust its playcalling with an eye toward avoiding field goal situations.

""Absolutely. We had to change. We were in a different mode,"" Carroll said. ""We were still ready to kick a field goal if we had to, but we were going to do what we could to avoid that and not make that the issue.""

Although it was announced as a thigh injury, Carroll said Janikowski ""really hurt his hamstring"" on the attempt.

""I would think he just tried to kick it as hard as he could and hurt himself,"" Carroll said. ""He's never had that happen before.""

The play on which Janikowski's absence might have hurt the Seahawks the most was following a late Wilson-to-J.D. McKissic touchdown throw, which was followed by Chris Carson's conversion run. Dickson attempted an onside dropkick into a vacated area behind Dallas' initial line of players, but the Cowboys caught the kick in the air to seal the victory.

""I wish Mikey could've found a better place to drop that kick so we had a better shot at it,"" Carroll said. ""It was unfortunate. We had plenty of time. We had 1:18 left. We get the ball right there, we're going to have a real shot at winning that game.""

Carroll said after Janikowski briefly left the Seahawks' win over the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 16 that Dickson would dropkick his field goal and extra point attempts if the team ever needed him.

Seahawks Backers Convert Late Sebastian Janikowski's absence might have hurt the Seahawks, but it sure helped some bettors. Chris Carson's two-point conversion run for Seattle -- necessitated by Janikowski being unable to kick -- with 1:18 remaining made it a 24-22 game. The closing line was -2.5 for the Cowboys. Carson's conversion and the late TD also pushed the game over the total of 43.

Dickson, who is from Sydney and grew up playing Australian rules football, was practicing field goals at halftime with Wilson holding after Janikowski was hurt on a missed 57-yard attempt at the end of the second quarter. Dickson is usually Seattle's holder. Several of his kicks were hooked to the right, though he and Wilson embraced after appearing to end on a make.

After Wilson scored on a 4-yard run with 2:03 left in the third quarter, the Seahawks chose to go for two rather than have Dickson kick the extra point. They converted the attempt and went up 14-10.

A dropkicked extra point in a playoff game wouldn't have been unprecedented, though it has been a long time since it happened. According to the Pro Football Hall of Fame via ESPN Stats & Information, Ray ""Scooter"" McLean of the Bears successfully dropkicked an extra point following Ken Kavanaugh's 42-yard fumble recovery for a touchdown during Chicago's 37-9 win over the New York Giants in the 1941 NFL Championship Game.

According to the PHOF, Hall of Famer Earl ""Dutch"" Clark is believed to be the last player to successfully dropkick a field goal in the NFL. According to game accounts, he dropkicked a 17-yard field goal in the Detroit Lions 16-7 victory over the Chicago Cardinals on Sept. 19, 1937.

Dickson was named a first-team All-Pro and became the first rookie punter to make the Pro Bowl since 1985.

Seattle's only points at halftime came on Janikowski field goals from 27 and 42 yards. According to ESPN Stats & Info, those were his first made field goals in the playoffs since Super Bowl XXXVII after the 2002 season.

4598,San Francisco,https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Huge-storm-descends-on-Bay-Area-to-bring-rain-13538068.php,"Relentless rain pounded Northern California, slicked highways and contributed to two fatal traffic accidents that killed four people in the Sierra foothills and Wine Country.

The rain also was being blamed Wednesday for toppling a tree that fell onto a homeless encampment in Oakland, killing an unidentified person.

Mudslides, hail, high winds, toppled trees, snow and downed power lines were all part of the biggest storm of the new year as an atmospheric river and cold front grabbed hold of the Bay Area and is not expected to let go until Thursday.

Too much water was everywhere. There were 30-foot waves off the coast, small stream flood advisories in the North Bay and a leak that forced the closure of the Civic Center BART Station on Wednesday afternoon.

Flights were delayed up to three hours at Bay Area airports. Ferryboats were delayed up to 15 minutes on San Francisco Bay.

âWhen you get that much rain in that short amount of time, it will start to overwhelm, especially a lot of the street drainages,â said National Weather Service meteorologist Ryan Walbrun. âA lot of the streams and creeks in Marin County and Santa Cruz and Sonoma, they will have rapid rises.â

BARTâs Civic Center Station in San Francisco was shut down by flooding Wednesday afternoon. A leak from the Muni platform one level above sent water onto the BART platform. Standing water near United Nations Plaza forced BART to close the station entrance there.

Evening BART service was disrupted when a large tree struck a train car between the Concord and Pleasant Hill stations. No one was injured, but service was disrupted and trains in both directions were rerouted to a single track for more than an hour while crews worked to clear the obstruction.

Heavy rain played a factor in a Tuesday evening collision on Highway 50 in Camino (El Dorado County), said Highway Patrol Officer David Rodgers. A family of three, including a 1-year-old child, was killed when their vehicle spun out on the freeway and struck another car, whose driver was seriously injured. They were not immediately identified, but authorities said the driver was a 51-year-old man from Fremont.

Another fatal accident occurred shortly before 3 p.m. Wednesday on Highway 121 at Napa Road in Napa County. Firefighters were called to extract a victim from one of three vehicles involved. Details of the accident and the identity of the victim were not immediately known.

Around 5 p.m., the wind and rain caused a tree to fall on the homeless encampment near Ardley Avenue and Interstate 580 in Oakland.

âI can confirm there was a fatality,â said CHP Officer Eric Anderson. No further details were available.

Three hours later, a big rig flipped onto its side on the eastbound lanes of the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge at mid-span, blocking two lanes of traffic, the Highway Patrol said. It was not immediately known whether there were injuries.

A high surf warning will last through Friday. A small-stream flood advisory was in effect in the North Bay. The storm also closed the perpetually weather-challenged Great Highway in San Francisco from Golden Gate Park to the San Francisco Zoo.

For most of Wednesday, the Highway Patrol was reporting a new hazard, collision, toppled tree, flooded area or nonworking traffic light about every five minutes.

âThe combination of saturated soils and strong winds, thatâs the type of setup where trees can come down,â Walbrun said.

All around the Bay Area, the storm sent rain gauges rising. Five inches of rain fell in Venado, in Sonoma County, in the 24 hours ending at 5 p.m. Wednesday. Novato got 2.09 inches, San Francisco got 1 inch and Oakland received 0.9 of an inch. Mount Umunhum in the Santa Cruz Mountains got 3.31 inches.

The heavy rain still left the Bay Area drier than usual for this time of year. San Francisco has received 9.25 inches of rain so far this season, or 83 percent of normal. San Jose has received 5.19 inches, or 78 percent of normal. Santa Rosa has received 16.20 inches, or 89 percent of normal.

Weather Service forecaster Steve Anderson said the heavy rain will turn to showers on Thursday and skies will clear on Friday and Saturday. A light rain could fall Sunday.

âIt looks to be dry all next week,â Anderson said. âThis storm could have been way worse. Instead of heavy rain for a few hours, it could have been a lot longer.â

In the Sierra, officials posted an avalanche warning through 7 a.m. Friday. A blizzard warning was already in effect with possible whiteout conditions.

Nearly 2 feet of snow had already fallen at Northstar and Sugar Bowl as of Wednesday. Driving to the ski areas was only for the strong-willed. Chains were required to cross the Sierra on Interstate 80 and Highways 50 and 88. The Highway Patrol was holding back trucks in both directions on I-80. An avalanche warning closed part of Highway 88 near the Kirkwood ski area.

In the Lake Tahoe area, up to 5 feet of snow is expected in the higher elevations and close to 2 feet at the lake level, forecasters said.

And scenic Highway 1 along the Big Sur coast was closed at two locations due to storm conditions, Caltrans said.

Lightning strikes were spotted Wednesday off the coast and in parts of Point Reyes and San Mateo, according to the National Weather Service.

Thursday, âwhen thereâs a more cold, unstable air mass around, we could see lots of reports of small hail,â Walbrun said.

4599,San Francisco,https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/PG-E-officially-files-for-bankruptcy-seeking-13569611.php,"Pacific Gas and Electric Co. and its parent company followed through early Tuesday on their plans to seek bankruptcy protection because of the mounting toll they face from the past two seasons of devastating Northern California wildfires.

In legal filings, PG&E said the business wants to reorganize under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code because of the âactual and potential liabilitiesâ of the company. Shares of parent company PG&E Corp. closed at $13.99, up 16.5 percent.

The court papers made official what PG&E told employees earlier this month due to a new California wildfire law that requires 15 days advance notice to workers before a change of control in the company, which the law defines to include filing for bankruptcy protection.

âThe power and gas will stay on,â PG&E wrote in a statement posted on its website. âWe will continue to provide you with reliable electric and natural gas service, and that will not change as a result of this process. To be very clear, we are not âgoing out of business,â and there will be no disruption in the services you expect from us.â

PG&E Corp.âs filing listed $71.4 billion in assets and $51.7 billion in debt. Pacific Gas and Electric Co. accounted for almost all of those amounts, with its petition listing $71.2 billion in assets and $51.4 billion in debt.

Experts agreed the bankruptcy filing by Californiaâs largest utility wonât affect its customersâ ability to keep their lights on. But the process has potential to spur fundamental changes, such as a possible sale of the gas side of the business, as the company reorganizes. It could also eventually affect customer rates and delay or reduce the payments received by thousands of wildfire victims who have sued PG&E.

Gov. Gavin Newsom said PG&Eâs filing was the companyâs decision and does not deter his focus on âprotecting the best interests of the people of California.â

âMy administration will continue working to ensure that Californians have access to safe, reliable and affordable service, that victims and employees are treated fairly, and that California continues to make forward progress on our climate change goals,â Newsom said in a statement.

In the short term, the filing will place restrictions on PG&Eâs operations by putting the company under supervision of a bankruptcy court and limiting its ability to make any major decisions without the courtâs approval.

PG&Eâs interim CEO John Simon, the companyâs general counsel who stepped into the top role earlier this month following the resignation of Geisha Williams, told employees in an email Tuesday that the company expects the bankruptcy process to last about two years.

He stressed in the email, a copy of which was obtained by The Chronicle, that the 16 million people served by PG&E will continue receiving electricity and gas, and the companyâs workforce of approximately 24,000 will still be paid and receive health care benefits. He also said âthere are bound to be surprisesâ as PG&E goes under supervision of the bankruptcy court.

âThroughout this process, our call to action is to further improve our operations and business practices so that we emerge from reorganization as a company that is positioned to serve our communities safely and reliably for many years to come,â Simon wrote.

The bankuptcy proceedings opened Tuesday afternoon with a 75-minute hearing before U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali of San Francisco, who also presided over PG&Eâs 2001 bankruptcy. With every seat taken in his court and an overflow courtroom next door, Montali scheduled hearings for four days a month through April on PG&Eâs plans to reorganize and pay its debts and any competing plans submitted by wildfire victims and others with claims against the utility.

PG&E is planning a âsmooth transitionâ into bankruptcy, with a filing that contains ânothing unusual except the numbers,â attorney Tobias Keller told Montali.

The judge also scheduled a hearing Thursday to hear the utilityâs opening statement and short-term financing measures and any objections voiced by the U.S. bankruptcy trusteeâs office, an arm of the Justice Department.

The bankruptcy filing provoked a strong reaction from PG&Eâs largest union, IBEW Local 1245, which represents about 12,000 company employees. The union does not know what shape the company will take when it emerges from bankruptcy but indicated it opposed some of the major changes the process could produce, Tom Dalzell, the unionâs business manager, said in a statement.

âParceling out the utility into smaller, weaker segments would unquestionably have a negative impact on the safety and stability of both gas and electric service, it would increase costs, and it would decelerate progress toward Californiaâs ambitious clean energy goals,â Dalzell said in the statement. âFurthermore, selling or municipalizing some or all of PG&Eâs gas or electric transmission or distribution systems would not solve the overarching issue of climate change and the strict liability policies that have put PG&E and all other California utilities on an unsustainable trajectory.â

PG&E has said its liability from 2017 and 2018 wildfires could exceed $30 billion, but that was before state investigators cleared the company of being responsible for one of the worst blazes, the Tubbs Fire, which devastated parts of Santa Rosa in 2017.

The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, issued a finding last week that said the wildfire was caused by privately controlled electrical equipment, not PG&E power lines.

Attorneys for fire victims said they can still argue PG&E was responsible for the Tubbs Fire and vowed to continue with their efforts. Cal Fire has said PG&E was responsible for a series of other fires that burned in Northern California in October 2017.

The most decisive wildfire problem for PG&E, however, has proved to be last yearâs Camp Fire, which killed 86 people and burned more than 18,800 buildings in Butte County, making it both the deadliest and most destructive fire in state history. PG&E has detailed two sources of malfunctioning equipment: a transmission tower near one suspected origin point for the fire and another distribution line in the area, fueling widespread speculation that the inferno will be blamed on the utility.

Shares of PG&E Corp. plummeted after the Camp Fire and took a nosedive after the company announced its plan to seek bankruptcy protection earlier this month.

The bankruptcy filing comes about 18 years after PG&Eâs utility subsidiary sought bankruptcy protection because of the early 2000s energy crisis. That case is still open, PG&E noted in its new filing. But the circumstances differ: PG&Eâs current financial problems stem from the future wildfire liability itâs staring down, whereas the 2001 Chapter 11 filing was motivated by a more immediate cash flow problem caused by high electricity costs.

âIt was quite a different situation, and it had nothing to do with liability,â said Paul Patterson, an analyst with Glenrock Associates.

PG&Eâs dire financial straits today also involve more claims that the utility might be shown to be directly responsible for, allegedly by maintaining its equipment poorly, Patterson said.

Another significant difference is that the parent company is joining the utility in bankruptcy. In 2001, PG&E sought to keep its unregulated energy businesses separate from the regulated utility, but now, its utility is its primary business.

The need for PG&Eâs current bankruptcy filing had been questioned by some, including activists and some shareholders.

âWe think that PG&E is being very irresponsible by filing for bankruptcy when it is financially solvent,â said Mark Toney, executive director of The Utility Reform Network. âWe really see the bankruptcy as a way for PG&E to try to duck its responsibilities and accountability for its criminal behavior.â

PG&E has consistently said that the company viewed a Chapter 11 filing as the only viable path for the business.

Steve Malnight, the utilityâs senior vice president of energy supply and policy, said in an interview that the company faces a âmassive potential liabilityâ because of thousands of claims against it stemming from the 2017 and 2018 wildfires, with thousands more likely coming related to the Camp Fire.

That liability prompted multiple credit downgrades that limited PG&Eâs ability to access funding it needs to safely operate its system, Malnight said.

âThat is something that we could not put at risk,â he said.

The bankruptcy filing isnât the only wildfire-fueled obstacle in PG&Eâs path. The federal judge overseeing its probation from the 2010 San Bruno pipeline explosion has also proposed a sweeping fire prevention plan that PG&E has said is infeasible. A hearing is scheduled for Wednesday in San Francisco.

Might I suggest you focus your limited attention span on, say... your Supreme Court nominee who may have committed perjury... or the hundreds of kids STILL separated from their families. Thx. â Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom) October 2, 2018

SAN FRANCISCO (KGO) -- Gavin Newsom's meteoric rise to become governor of California has not been an easy one.He faced harsh criticism from fellow Democrats for igniting the same-sex marriage debate in 2004 when San Francisco began granting official marriage licenses to same-sex couples.His words, ""It's going to happen, whether you like it or not,"" were used to invigorate conservative voters.Newsom is often outspoken. He describes the National Rifle Association as ""morally bankrupt"" and accused President Donald Trump for ""operating as if he's a monarch.""Even though he was born into a prominent San Francisco family -- his father William Newsom was a California state appeals court judge with close ties to billionaire Gordon Getty -- his childhood was not easy.Newson suffers from dyslexia, which he said made school a terrible and terrorizing experience. He opened up about the condition a few years ago on ABC7's ""Beyond the Headlines ,"" saying that he felt dumb in school.""I rarely read speeches and if I do they are the worst things I ever do,"" said Newsom, who prefers to improvise when speaking in public.He's had a long time to hone those skills. He was just 30 years old when he was appointed by former Mayor Willie Brown to fill a vacancy on the Board of Supervisors in 1997.As supervisor he championed several controversial initiatives that won the backing of voters. Care Not Cash replaced cash payments to homeless in exchange for housing and social services in 2002. A year later, Proposition M banned aggressive panhandling in public areas.Just 34 days after becoming mayor of San Francisco in 2004, Newsom directed the city clerk to issue same-sex marriage licenses. The courts debated the legality of these unions for more than a decade until the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2015 that they were a right guaranteed by the Constitution.In 2007, Newsom introduced Healthy San Francisco , which provided universal healthcare for all city residents. San Francisco was the first city in the nation to implement such a policy.Since he became lieutenant governor, Newsom pushed for the legalization of recreational cannabis and pushed for more strict gun control laws in the state.He has also tussled with the White House. He recently sent a tweet to Trump, asking to debate him directly after the president criticized Newsom.",VIDEO Looking back at Gavin Newsom's rise from renegade San Francisco mayor to governor of California,auto_google,['local_politics'],[]
