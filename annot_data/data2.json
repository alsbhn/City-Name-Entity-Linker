For criminal cases, victims can seek prosecution until they turn 28. The bill also includes a one-year window during which victims of any age or time limit can come forward to prosecute.\n\n\"New York has just gone from being one of the worst states in the country to being one of the best,\" in terms of the statute of limitations for child sex abuse cases, said Marci Hamilton, CEO of Child USA and a professor at the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nHamilton said the bill \"represents over 15 years of work by survivors and advocates trying to get around the stiff opposition from the Catholic bishops and the insurance industry\" and is a step forward in the national conversation. There are eight other states considering similar legislation.\n\nSurvivors and supporters gather at the New York State Capitol Monday to celebrate the passage of the New York Child Victims Act.\n\nWhat's the law nationally?\n\nMany other states allow victims to sue their abusers for decades after their abuse. Oklahoma, for example, allows victims to come forward until age 45 in both civil and criminal cases.\n\n\"The fact that New York has stepped up and vastly improved its statute of limitations, it helps to pave the way for other states who haven't yet taken steps to improve their statute of limitations,\" said Stephen Forrester, director of government relations and administration at the New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.\n\nForrester stressed the significance of the one-year window in the bill that will allow victims of all ages and time scales to come forward. \"That's an aspect that really goes a long way at restoring justice,\" he said, and it is less common nationally. According to advocacy group Child USA, nine states have no statute of limitations for civil cases, which would allow child sex abuse victims to come forward at any point in their life -- as they will be able to during the one-year window.\n\nNew York's law will also give victims significantly more time to disclose their histories of abuse. Experts, including Forrester, say there is a need for a long statute of limitations in cases of child sexual abuse because it can take victims years to come forward. \"For many different reasons, victims need time to come forward to report their abuse,\" Forrester said. Victims can often suffer from prolonged or delayed trauma.\n\nAccording to statistics from Child USA, the majority of child sexual abuse victims do not choose to disclose, if they do at all, until the average age of 52.\n\nChild USA's Hamilton said that extending the statute of limitation for civil litigation will help expand the public knowledge of how widespread child sexual abuse is. She said it is often during civil cases that experts learn about how patterns of abuse operate.\n\n\"We have this silent pandemic in this country,\" she said. \"We didn't really understand that this was everywhere.\"\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 1 in 7 children have experienced child abuse and/or neglect in the last year.\n\nCatholic Church opposition\n\nMonday's bill passage comes after more than a decade of opposition from the Catholic Church in New York. In a news conference on Monday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who is a Roman Catholic, blamed the church directly for preventing the bill's passage.\n\nSpeaking about why the bill took years to pass, Cuomo said, \"I believe it was the conservatives in the Senate who were threatened by the Catholic Church.\" The bill passed the Senate unanimously on Monday. In November 2018, Democrats took over the Republican-held Senate.\n\nCuomo also referenced Pope Francis, who has spoken about the Catholic Church's need to confront its history of child sexual abuse. \"I don't think I'm against the Catholic Church,\" Cuomo said, \"I think the bishops may have a different position than the Pope, and I'm with the Pope,\" he said.\n\nNew York's Catholic Conference previously opposed the bill but dropped its opposition after the bill was amended to allow prosecution of both private and public institutions.\n\nAttorney Mitchell Garabedian has prosecuted thousands of clergy abuse cases over the past 25 years, including those stemming from the Boston Globe's investigation of the Archdiocese of Boston.\n\nIn an interview Monday, Garabedian told CNN this legislation will be hugely significant. \"I think there will be a flood of litigation,\" he said, adding that he has more than 100 cases waiting to be filed.\n\n\"It's a model for many, many states in the United States for them to follow,\" Garabedian said. In a statement, he added, \"There is now hope for justice, respect and validation for thousands of sexual abuse victims sexually abused in New York.\"\n\nCuomo's office said he is expected to sign the bill into law soon.", "title": "New York passes Child Victims Act, allowing child sex abuse survivors to sue their abusers", "dataset": "auto_google", "labels": "['seems_not_related_to_city']", "annot_city": "[]"}, {"id": 4503, "city": "New York", "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46994583", "text": "Image copyright Livia Abreu/Erika Christensen/Merle Hoffman Image caption Three women with different perspectives on the new law\n\nOn the 46th anniversary of the landmark US ruling that made abortion legal, New York state signed into law a new abortion rights bill. Why is it so controversial?\n\nThe Reproductive Health Act (RHA) has been seen by some as a necessary move to safeguard abortion rights should the Supreme Court overturn the ruling, known as Roe v Wade.\n\nAnd it comes at a time when states such as Mississippi, Iowa and Ohio are rolling back abortion provisions.\n\nWhile others see it as an \"extreme\" and \"inhumane\" expansion of abortion access.\n\nThe act removes the need for a doctor to perform some abortions and takes abortion out of the criminal code, making it a public health issue.\n\nHowever, the most controversial aspect of the RHA is the provision allowing abortions after 24 weeks in cases where there is an \"absence of foetal viability, or the abortion is necessary to protect the patient's life or health\".\n\nThe RHA has caused an intense and heated debate about how abortion is regulated in New York, with impassioned arguments made on each side.\n\nWe heard some of those views.\n\n'Devastating'\n\nIn 2016, Erika Christensen was pregnant and living in New York with her husband. The couple were thrilled.\n\nHowever, at 31 weeks, she found out that her pregnancy was \"nonviable\", meaning that the baby would not survive outside the womb.\n\nMs Christensen told the BBC that she \"didn't know about the law\" banning abortion in New York beyond 24 weeks.\n\n\"We wanted to end the suffering of this child. It was a simple choice.\"\n\nAfter doing some research she realised she would have to leave the state to terminate her pregnancy.\n\nShe borrowed $10,000 (\u00c2\u00a37,600) from her mum, and flew halfway across the country to have an abortion in Colorado.\n\nImage copyright Erika Christensen Image caption Erika Christensen, her daughter Pepper and husband Garin Marschall in 2018\n\n\"I know I am lucky. I am middle-class and have access to those kinds of resources. But it was still really devastating.\n\n\"The laws of New York made the grieving process so much harder,\" Ms Christensen said. \"There is an inherent shame in having to leave your state to do this. It made a bad situation so much worse.\"\n\nSince then, she has campaigned for New York to change its laws on abortion.\n\nShe hopes that the RHA will help women in a similar situation to her \"work through their grief without having to fight the system\".\n\n\"These women should be able to focus on healing.\"\n\n'Time to double down'\n\nChristina Fadden, chair of the anti-abortion organisation New York State Right to Life, told the BBC she was \"extremely saddened\" by the RHA being signed into law.\n\nMs Fadden said it was \"horrific\" that \"there is now no protection for unborn children in the state of New York\".\n\nShe disputes the assertion that the RHA is a necessary update to the state's law, and suggests that allowing abortions beyond 24 weeks is \"inhumane\".\n\nImage copyright New York State Right To Life Image caption Christina Fadden speaking at the Syracuse March for Life in 2019\n\n\"I have got a fire in my belly and it's time to double down on fighting this,\" she said.\n\nMs Fadden is also concerned that the RHA makes abortion a \"fundamental right\" for women in New York, and will lead to \"pro-life viewpoint suppression\".\n\nShe told the BBC that her organisation has been \"overwhelmed\" by the number of people contacting them to volunteer in the wake of the RHA's ratification.\n\n\"We are still formulating our response, but we have to double our efforts.\"\n\nMore on the US abortion debate\n\n'A non-factor to the law'\n\nWhile much of the discussion surrounding the RHA focuses on the 24-week provision, the removal of abortion from the criminal code is also controversial.\n\nPro-choice campaigners maintain that abortion is a healthcare issue, while opponents to the RHA say that it removes protection for pregnant victims of domestic abuse.\n\nLivia Abreu was violently attacked by her boyfriend when she was 26 weeks pregnant. She was stabbed multiple times and lost her unborn baby.\n\nMs Abreu released a statement saying the RHA would decriminalise \"abortion as a product of an assault on a pregnant female\".\n\nImage copyright Livia Abreu Image caption Livia Abreu is worried pregnant victims of domestic abuse will not be protected by the RHA\n\nHer former partner is facing charges of abortion in the first and second degree, as well as attempted murder and assault.\n\n\"The passing of RHA will likely exonerate him from those charges,\" she wrote. \"Which will in turn lessen his sentence now that a judge has decided the case is going to trial and the new law will take effect prior to that date.\n\n\"Let that sink in. He will likely be convicted of the crimes he committed against me, but the loss of my daughter will be a non-factor to the law because she wasn't 'born and alive'.\n\n\"To clarify, I am neither pro-choice nor pro-life, I am very much neutral, because most things are never simply black or white.\"\n\nSupporters of the RHA suggest that there are existing laws to punish domestic abuse, and the issue should be separated from abortion.\n\n'Groundhog day'\n\nMerle Hoffman, who founded the Choices Women's Medical Center in New York in 1970, welcomes the change in the law, but feels it is \"overdue\".\n\n\"I have been working in this field for 48 years. It feels like I've been living in Groundhog day.\"\n\nShe told the BBC that her clinic has been unable to help women in \"sad and difficult situations\" because they were more than 24 weeks pregnant.\n\nImage copyright Choices Women's Medical Center Image caption Merle Hoffman has been providing abortions in New York since 1970\n\nMs Hoffman notes that many of the women who seek late-term abortions either didn't know they were pregnant for a long time, or experience complications in an originally wanted pregnancy.\n\n\"We have to get funding from various sources - often personally contributing money - to help these women access abortions services out of state.\"\n\nMs Hoffman describes New York in the early 1970s as an \"oasis\" for women seeking abortions before Roe v Wade, and sees a parallel with the state's decision to implement the RHA.\n\n\"I can see there being a sort of 'underground railroad' of women who will come to New York now. It is another access point on the east coast.\"\n\nMs Hoffman, is also keen to point out that only around 1% abortions in the US happen after 21 weeks.\n\n'Options not restrictions'\n\nKaitlyn Marchesano, often answers the phone to people seeking financial help to terminate a pregnancy.\n\nShe works for the New York Abortion Access Fund, which supports people who are unable to pay for an abortion.\n\n\"Hearing a voice on the other end of the line going through this awful experience is challenging,\" reflects Ms Marchesano. \"The difficulty they face is heart-breaking.\"\n\nMs Marchesano says she finds it \"incredibly frustrating\" that it is so difficult for people to access abortion later in their pregnancy.\n\nImage copyright NYAAF Image caption Kaitlyn Marchesano works to help woman seeking abortions access funding\n\nWhile abortion is covered by the Medicaid health programme in New York, she says people \"hit a funding wall\" beyond 24 weeks.\n\n\"They take on a considerable financial burden when they have to travel out of state. The cost of travel, child care, lost wages, accommodation add up on top of the cost of the procedure.\"\n\n\"The human body doesn't follow a legal timeline. People need options not restrictions.\"\n\n'Grisly and gruesome'\n\nCardinal Timothy Dolan leads the archdioceses of New York and has been a vocal opponent to the RHA.\n\nSpeaking to Fox News, Cardinal Dolan said the new law was \"ghoulish, grisly and gruesome\", and \"not good for our country\".\n\nNew York governor Andrew Cuomo, who is a Catholic, has come under fire after signing the law, and some have called for him to be excommunicated..\n\nImage copyright Getty Images Image caption Cardinal Timothy Dolan speaking in New York in 2018\n\nCardinal Dolan said he gets \"wheelbarrows full of letters every day\" asking him to take firm action against the governor, but he said it \"would be counterproductive\".\n\n\"It would give ammo to our enemies who would say this is an internal Catholic disciplinary matter.\"", "title": "New York abortion law Why are so many people talking about it ", "dataset": "auto_google", "labels": "['seems_not_related_to_city']", "annot_city": "[]"}, {"id": 4504, "city": "New York", "url": "https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/new-york-cuomo-green-new-deal-clean-energy", "text": "New York Governor Andrew Cuomo announced the launch of a \"Green New Deal\" initiative Tuesday, responding to pressure for bold climate action from progressives and clean energy advocates.\n\nThe plan, outlined in Cuomo's 2019 Justice Agenda, calls for a \"globally unprecedented\" ramp-up in renewable energy deployments as New York seeks to achieve 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2040, and ultimately to eliminate its entire carbon footprint.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAmidst the Trump administration\u00e2\u0080\u0099s assault on the environment and in order to continue New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s progress in the fight against climate change,\" the briefing states, \"Governor Cuomo is announcing New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Green New Deal, a nation-leading clean energy and jobs agenda that will put the state on a path to carbon neutrality across all sectors of New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s economy.\"\n\nFormer California Governor Jerry Brown signed a similar executive order last fall calling for the Golden State to achieve carbon neutrality economy-wide by 2045. California also passed legislation to achieve 100 percent clean electricity by the same year. If Cuomo's 100 percent carbon-free electricity goal is approved by the state legislature, New York will officially have the most aggressive \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and legally binding \u00e2\u0080\u0094 clean energy target in the country.\n\nThe cornerstone of Cuomo's Green New Deal is to boost New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Clean Energy Standard from 50 percent to 70 percent renewable electricity by 2030. To meet this new mandate, the briefing calls for:\n\nNearly quadrupling New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s offshore wind target to 9,000 megawatts by 2035, up from 2,400 megawatts by 2030\n\nDoubling distributed solar deployment to 6,000 megawatts by 2025, up from 3,000 megawatts by 2023\n\nMore than doubling new large-scale, land-based wind and solar resources through the Clean Energy Standard\n\nMaximizing the contributions and potential of New York's existing renewable resources\n\nDeploying 3,000 megawatts of energy storage by 2030\n\nGov. Cuomo also announced $1.5 billion in competitive awards to support 20 large-scale solar, wind and energy storage projects across upstate New York. These projects are expected to add 1,650 megawatts of capacity and generate enough renewable energy to power nearly 550,000 homes. All projects are expected to be operational by 2022 and create more than 2,600 short- and long-term jobs in the process.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s commitment to wind and solar power will attract the interest and investment we need to get projects built,\" said Anne Reynolds, executive director of the Alliance for Clean Energy New York. \"And we applaud the governor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s announcement that eight new staff members will be hired to accelerate renewable project siting and permitting.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nVote Solar \u00e2\u0080\u0094 along with a coalition of industry, environmental and clean energy advocacy partners, as well as the support of dozens of lawmakers \u00e2\u0080\u0094 has been urging Gov. Cuomo for the past year to establish a goal of 1 million solar-powered homes across New York by 2023, the equivalent of the new 6,000-megawatt solar target.\n\n\"With Governor Cuomo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s commitment to 1one million solar customers, New York will put thousands to work, save millions on electric bills, and spur local economic investments and opportunity to communities all across the state,\" said Sean Garren, senior Northeast director at Vote Solar, who led the Million Solar Strong New York campaign.\n\n\"We will continue working with the administration and the legislature to meet this goal and ensure that the growing solar economy meaningfully serves all New Yorkers, including at least 100,000 low-income families,\" he continued.\n\nTo hit the 6,000-megawatt target, the Cuomo administration is expected to direct the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) to double the NY-Sun incentive program. To ensure that clean energy is affordable and accessible for low-income and underserved communities, Cuomo will also direct NYSERDA and the Department of Public Service to expand their Solar For All program and couple it with energy savings opportunities.\n\nWhile elements of the plan pertaining to low- and middle-income customers will be dealt with administratively, Vote Solar said it will also work with legislative allies to get those program benefits enshrined in statute.\n\nAs for Cuomo's 100 percent carbon-free electricity goal, it will be part of the state budget, which still has to go through the legislature. Vote Solar and its partners also plan to support that effort.\n\nThat task could be made easier by the fact that Democrats took control of the New York State Legislature last election, for the first time in a decade. Growing momentum across the country around the concept of a Green New Deal, championed by New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, could also push state lawmakers to make Cuomo's clean energy goals binding.\n\nSeparate from the clean energy targets, Cuomo's Green New Deal will create New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first statutory Climate Action Council, comprising relevant state agency leaders and other workforce, environmental justice and clean energy experts. The council will evaluate a wide range of options for making the state carbon-neutral, including the feasibility of a new multistate emissions reduction program that covers all sectors of the economy.\n\nAccording to the 2019 Justice Agenda, this work is to commence immediately and align with development of the next State Energy Plan over the next two years. The briefing notes that there will be ample opportunity for public comment as the council develops New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first carbon-neutrality roadmap.", "title": "New York Gov.

Andrew M. Cuomo quickly signed into law Tuesday night, was pushed through by Democrats who now control both legislative houses. The Senate passed it 38-24. In the Assembly, it passed by a 92-47 margin.\n\nIn the face of calls at the federal level to weaken abortion rights, the bill maintains abortions as legal within 24 weeks of the start of a pregnancy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 \u00e2\u0080\u009cor at any time when necessary to protect a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life or health.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Late-term abortions had previously been authorized under state law if they meant saving the life of a woman.\n\nThe measure, which takes effect immediately, expands access to abortions by authorizing other health professionals \u00e2\u0080\u0093 beyond physicians under a 1970 state law that came three years ahead of the landmark Roe v. Wade U.S. Supreme Court decision \u00e2\u0080\u0093 to perform abortions.\n\nPhysician assistants will be permitted to also carry out surgical abortions and licensed midwives and nurse practitioners can do nonsurgical procedures using medications if they are \u00e2\u0080\u009cacting within his or her lawful scope of practice,\" according to the legislation.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Legislature finds that comprehensive reproductive health care is a fundamental component of every individual\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health, privacy and equality,\" reads the opening sentence of the new law.\n\nSigns and citizen lobbyists were scattered throughout the Capitol. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLate term children feel pain,\" read one sign of an anti-abortion protester.

Wade attacks propel new measure\n\nAdvocates say the measure is needed to protect abortion access in New York in the event the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade. Tuesday was the 46th anniversary of the landmark court ruling.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are lots of bills that are in the hopper at various levels of government seeking to bring the best test case to the Supreme Court for an outright overturning of abortion. What it would do would be to revert (the issue) to the states. New York would be one of the states where a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s basic rights would be protected,\" said Assemblywoman Deborah Glick, a Manhattan Democrat and the bill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sponsor in the 150-member Assembly.\n\nGlick said parts of the measure passed Tuesday were about codifying New York law with federal case law, including Roe v. Wade. Other sections, such as expanding who can perform abortions, go beyond those case laws to stake out new legal ground in New York.\n\nIn 2016, the most recent year for which statistics are available, 82,189 abortions were performed in the state. Ninety-one percent were performed in settings other than a hospital. Fifty-seven percent of those were for women between the ages of 20 and 29. Just over 1,700, or 2.3 percent, were conducted when fetuses were at or after 20 weeks old. Just over 2,800 abortions were performed in Erie and Niagara counties that year, according to state Health Department data.\n\nTo claims that the new measure will increase late-term abortions, Glick said such procedures \u00e2\u0080\u009care generally individual tragedies. Those are wanted pregnancies that either go awry or a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health is dramatically impacted.\" She said women needing late-term abortions often needed to travel to other states because abortions conducted after the 24th week other than to save a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life was a criminal penalty.\n\nBut critics, led chiefly by Republicans in the Legislature, say the measure will lead to more abortions in New York, especially later in a pregnancy.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe proponents have been saying this is merely a codification of Roe v. Wade. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a far more dramatic expansion of abortion,\" said State Sen. Chris Jacobs, a Buffalo Republican. \"It will make it much easier for late term abortions and partial birth abortions.\"\n\nJacobs said New York\u00e2\u0080\u0099s longtime statute permitting legal abortions until the 24th week of a pregnancy is already among the longest in the world, and that the new provision allowing later term abortions for also the \u00e2\u0080\u009chealth\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the mother can be interpreted as mental or emotional conditions.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI feel as though they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re using the fear of the Supreme Court doing something as a ability to dramatically expand abortions rights in this state. I believe even pro-choice people, if they knew what was in this bill, would not be supportive of it,\" the lawmaker added.\n\nA generations\u00e2\u0080\u0099 old fight plays out\n\nIn his State of the State in 1970, then-Gov. Nelson Rockefeller, a Republican, called the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abortion laws \u00e2\u0080\u009carchaic.\" Still on the books was an 1830 statute that permitted abortions \u00e2\u0080\u0093 at any time during a pregnancy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 if the mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life was in danger.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI urge your humble bodies to resolve the differences of the past and to give favorable action to much-needed legislation on abortions reforms,\" Rockefeller told lawmakers.\n\nLater that session, New York made national headlines and joined a movement by a handful of other states in making abortion legal. Three years later, the Supreme Court OK'd abortion.\n\nLast week, Cuomo proposed taking the Reproductive Health Act a step further: putting abortion protections into the state constitution. \u00e2\u0080\u009cLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s write the rights of Roe v. Wade into the state constitution so it can never be changed. No matter what happens politically,\" Cuomo said in his State of the State speech.\n\nIn 1970, like now, a leading voice against the abortion efforts was the Catholic Church, which in 1970 characterized the abortion bill as \u00e2\u0080\u009ctragic.\" Last week, bishops in New York, acknowledging they had lost another abortion fight in Albany, said the new measure \u00e2\u0080\u009cwill expand our state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s already radically permissive (abortion) law.\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099\n\nSenate Democratic takeover pushes bill to passage\n\nThe path to passage of the RHA began in earnest in the Assembly in 2006. Republicans in control of the Senate reliably blocked the measure over the years. The GOP dominance ended with decisive defeats at the hands of Democrats in November.\n\nPink \u00e2\u0080\u0093 via scarves, ties and jackets \u00e2\u0080\u0093 was the color of the day for many lawmakers, who returned to Albany after a long weekend to pass a bill whose outcome had little drama given that both houses already committed to approving it early in the new 2019 session.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, a Westchester Democrat, recalled how she introduced the abortion measure in 2007. She said the idea was called \u00e2\u0080\u009ccrazy\u00e2\u0080\u009d and a \u00e2\u0080\u009csolution seeking a problem\u00e2\u0080\u009d because no one really thought Roe v. Wade could be overturned.\n\nNow, with a conservative majority on the Supreme Court\u00e2\u0080\u0099s bench and with Trump vowing to fight to undo some abortion rights, she said Tuesday that efforts to undo Roe v. Wade in Washington and elsewhere are real.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cToday, in New York, we are saying no. Not here in New York. And we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not just saying no. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re saying here in New York women\u00e2\u0080\u0099s health matters,\" she said at the Capitol in a rare joint press conference between Senate Democrats and their fellow Democrats in the Assembly.\n\nSenate Republicans, though, warned that the new measure will have dangerous consequences. They said the legislation repeals criminal code language regarding illegal abortions. They brought a woman to the Capitol from the Bronx who was attacked last year by her then-boyfriend; the multiple stabbing killed the 26-week-old fetus she was carrying and the man was charged with committing an illegal abortion.\n\nState Sen. Catharine Young, an Olean Republican, said taking the illegal abortion language out of the penal code is \u00e2\u0080\u009can assault on a woman\u00e2\u0080\u0099s fundamental right to pregnancy.\" They sought, and lost, to get an amendment for specific criminal charges against individuals whose actions result in miscarriage.\n\nDuring the Senate debate, State Sen. Andrew Lanza, a Staten Island Republican, said the new measure will treat someone who punches a woman who is not pregnant in the stomach \u00e2\u0080\u009cprecisely the same under our penal code as punching a pregnant woman with the intent of ending her pregnancy and in fact doing so.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI have to disagree with my colleague,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099 said State Sen. Liz Krueger, a Manhattan Democrat and the bill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sponsor in the Senate. She said other criminal penalties, such as first degree assault, provide prosecutors with tools to seek far longer prison sentences against domestic violence attackers, for instance, than the expiring abortion language in the criminal law.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t disadvantage any women \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 by changing our laws but we do protect a far greater number of women to get, without discrimination, the health care services when they need them,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Krueger said to Lanza.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere is nothing radical about this bill. The decision about whether to have an abortion is deeply personal,\" she said, adding that government should not play a role in those decisions. Krueger said New York law failed to meet the standards of Roe v. Wade and it was time to redo \u00e2\u0080\u009cantiquated\u00e2\u0080\u009d abortion laws.\n\nState Sen. Rob Ortt, a North Tonawanda Republican, said Democrats\u00e2\u0080\u0099 claims that the RHA bill is needed because of attacks by Trump on Roe v. Wade is \u00e2\u0080\u009cdisingenuous at best\u00e2\u0080\u009d because the measure has been kicking around Albany long before Trump became president. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe reality is this bill clearly defines \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 that we simply do not place any value, legally speaking, on the life of the unborn child,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099 he said.\n\nLawmakers push expanded contraceptive insurance coverage\n\nThe Reproductive Health Act was accompanied by two other pieces of legislation. First, health insurance policies would be required to cover all FDA-approved contraceptive drugs and devices, as well as voluntary sterilization procedures. Supporters said it will reduce unintended pregnancies, and includes maintaining an existing \u00e2\u0080\u009cconscience protection\u00e2\u0080\u009d for religious employers to opt out of having to offer contraceptive coverage in their employee health plans.\n\nAn additional part of Tuesday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s package bans discrimination based on an employee or a dependent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s reproductive health decision-making. It bans an employer from accessing information about a worker\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision to have an abortion without written permission from the employee. It also permits civil actions against employers who violate the bill\u00e2\u0080\u0099s provisions.\n\nThe New York Health Plan Association, which represents 26 managed health care plans in the state, said insurers already provide an array of contraceptive options through the federal Affordable Care Act. But the new measure greatly expands coverage and will add to insurance costs for employers and consumers.\n\nDemocrats hailed the day. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s another barrier-breaking day in New York,\" Stewart-Cousins, the new Senate majority leader, added.\n\nThe senator cautioned that lawmakers \u00e2\u0080\u009cby no means\u00e2\u0080\u009d believe important decisions about whether to undergo an abortion \u00e2\u0080\u009care to be taken lightly.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe need to get out of the way and let people make those choices,\u00e2\u0080\u0099\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Stewart-Cousins said.\n\nStewart-Cousins said the abortion measure is just one outcome of the Democratic takeover of the Senate, which will soon see new laws on everything from immigration to marijuana legalization in some way.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cYou voted for us for a reason.

Baldwin pleaded guilty in accordance with those terms, and the case was adjourned until March 27 for a compliance update.Baldwin must also pay a $120 surcharge.Baldwin's attorney stressed that his client pleaded guilty to a violation and not a crime.Baldwin and his lawyer didn't comment outside court, but the actor wasn't shy on Twitter, where he criticized the media for staking out his courtroom when there were more serious cases elsewhere in the building and for misreporting the allegations against him.\"The press reported that I punched someone. That is untrue, and that is a serious charge. A man was punched in NY recently and died,\" Baldwin tweeted, along with a link to a news article about a fatal bar fight in Queens last November.\"Nothing that resembles justice ever enters or leaves any courtroom in this country,\" he added.Baldwin was arrested on November 2 after police were told a driver pulled into a parking space that one of Baldwin's relatives was holding for him, and the two men started quarreling and pushing each other.The other driver told police Baldwin punched or slapped him. The 49-year-old man was taken to a hospital complaining of jaw pain and redness around his neck.Baldwin, who got booted off a flight in 2011 for refusing to put his cellphone away, was playing with his phone while waiting for Wednesday's hearing to start - but he didn't argue when court officers announced that phones had to be turned off and out of sight.As it was, the second-floor courtroom was already noisy - with the beeping sound of inmate-transport buses backing up outside, providing a constant, if not annoying, soundtrack for his appearance.----------", "title": "Alec Baldwin pleads guilty in Manhattan parking spot scuffle, will take anger management", "dataset": "auto_google", "labels": "['court', 'gossip_news']", "annot_city": "['New York']"}, {"id": 4508, "city": "New York", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/23/nyregion/238-million-penthouse-sale.html", "text": "[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]\n\nA hedge fund billionaire has purchased a Central Park penthouse apartment for $238 million \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the most anyone has ever paid for a home in the United States.\n\nThe sale, which closed Wednesday, was confirmed by a spokesman for the buyer, Kenneth Griffin.\n\nThe unit, a nearly 24,000-square-foot combination of two apartments, is at the top of 220 Central Park South, an under-construction tower developed by Vornado Trust Realty and designed by the firm of Robert A.M.

During the last two statewide elections, each side spent tens of millions of dollars on political campaigns to back candidates for governor and state superintendent of public instruction.\n\nHow the acrimony plays out in the Los Angeles strike, the first in 30 years, will have a ripple effect in school districts across California, as many wrestle with similar issues of declining enrollment, dwindling finances and a growing number of charter schools.\n\nCentral to the concerns of teachers and union leaders at Los Angeles Unified is the argument that the growth of charter schools in the city has come at the expense of dollars for district schools and the teachers working in them.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe want LAUSD and the City of L.A., and the County of Los Angeles, to join us in calling for a cap on charter schools,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Alex Caputo-Pearl, president of the union representing the roughly 31,000 striking teachers in Los Angeles, said Tuesday, hours before a large rally in front of the L.A. offices of the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest charter association. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThere are too many schools in Los Angeles right now. We do not need to have the \u00e2\u0080\u0098grow-as-fast-as-you-can\u00e2\u0080\u0099 business model that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s promoted by charter billionaires. We need to invest in our existing schools \u00e2\u0080\u0094 charter and district.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAs the United Teachers Los Angeles strike enters its third day, it is using its seat at the bargaining table to push a number of issues related to how charter schools are operated in the district. One, reforming how the district shares classroom space with charter schools, is a specific demand in the union\u00e2\u0080\u0099s negotiations with the district. Another, capping the number of charter schools, is a policy goal that the union is keeping top-of-mind during the strike.\n\nKey to the bitter dispute: Charter schools, which enroll about a fifth of students in Los Angeles Unified, have contributed to a loss of $600 million annually that otherwise would benefit students in district schools, according to union officials, largely because of fixed costs that can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be reduced even if there are fewer students. Charter backers have pushed back on those figures.\n\nEnrollment in the district has been declining since 2003, when more than 700,000 students were enrolled. Just over 480,000 students occupy seats in the district\u00e2\u0080\u0099s schools today. In addition, more than 100,000 are enrolled in independently run charter schools.\n\nWhether charter schools can be fully blamed for the drop in enrollment in district schools is an open question.\n\nBecause districts receive state money for the number of students they enroll, union leaders say students leaving for charter schools means less money for the district to cover the kinds of expenses the striking teachers are demanding. Those include a 6.5-percent salary increase, a reduction in class sizes and more money for support staff, such as nurses and school counselors.\n\nIn the days and weeks leading up to the strike, union officials have sought changes in how traditional public schools provide space to charter schools. State law requires districts to free up unused classrooms and other facilities for charter schools.\n\nSpecific to the contract dispute, Caputo-Pearl said his union wants limits on what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shared to free up computer labs, dance studios and music centers that can be used by students and teachers, even if the rooms aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t used all the time.\n\nLos Angeles Unified District officials say the union\u00e2\u0080\u0099s charter-school demands are beyond the scope of what state law says can be discussed during negotiations.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not an appropriate subject for bargaining,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Robert Samples, the district\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interim director of labor relations, saying these are issues that would have to be resolved in the Legislature.\n\nHe said the district proposed forming a working group to discuss how charter and district schools can share space. The union has called that proposal inadequate.\n\nDisputes over how charter and public schools should coexist don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t seem to have a place in contract negotiations, said Pedro Noguera, a UCLA professor of education and founder of the Center for Transformation of Schools.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not sure politically what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to gain through the strike\u00e2\u0080\u009d regarding charter schools, Noguera said.\n\nIf the main issue for striking teachers is more money, Noguera said, United Teachers Los Angeles is already in a stronger position thanks to newly elected Gov. Gavin Newsom.\n\nIn his first state budget proposal last week, Newsom proposed more money for K-12 education and extra dollars for school districts to pay their massive pension obligations \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a growing cost pressure for districts. The budget also included more money for homelessness and mental health services, \u00e2\u0080\u009call of which can translate into additional services and support for children served by LAUSD,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the governor said in a statement this week.\n\nFor Caputo-Pearl, though, the bigger issue is charter expansion. He thinks the show of strength this week during the strike will put pressure on state leaders to limit charter growth.\n\nIn response to questions about the strike this week, Newsom indicated that he is eager to sign legislation promoted by UTLA and other teachers unions requiring more transparency in charter school operations.\n\nThere is growing evidence that the charter sector in Los Angeles is having its own enrollment troubles, raising questions about whether there are more charter schools than there is demand.\n\nA recent district report concluded that charter schools the district authorized are struggling to reach enrollment goals. In 2017-18, independent charter schools overseen by the district enrolled 15,882 fewer students than what the charter school operators projected. Only 34 of 224 charter schools met or exceeded their enrollment targets.\n\nThe union on Tuesday held a rally outside of the Los Angeles office of the California Charter Schools Association, the state\u00e2\u0080\u0099s main charter school membership organization, which has received millions of dollars from wealthy donors through its political arm that it then distributes to candidates running for office.\n\nMyrna Castrej\u00c3\u00b3n, president and CEO of the charter schools association, said she supports the union\u00e2\u0080\u0099s demands for better pay and working conditions. But she added that while demand for charter schools in Los Angeles varies by neighborhood, around 16,000 students are on waitlists to get into particular charter schools in Los Angeles.\n\nDisagreements aside, teachers in both district and charter schools should have better pay and access to more resources, Caputo-Pearl said.\n\nOne of the three Accelerated Schools charter campuses, whose teachers are also represented by United Teachers Los Angeles, joined the strike on Tuesday \u00e2\u0080\u0094 the first charter school strike in California history, according to the union.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe actually support the original intent of charters, which was to have small efforts to innovate and then feed lessons back into the public system to try to help the overall public system,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Caputo-Pearl said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not happening.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nRandi Weingarten, the president of the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s second-largest teachers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 union, with 1.7 million members, the American Federation of Teachers, on Tuesday said charter groups are trying \u00e2\u0080\u009cto divide educator against educator.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nCharter schools aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t typically unionized, though in California about 30 percent are represented by unions, according to the California Charter Schools Association.\n\nTeachers at unionized charter schools in Los Angeles are sympathetic to the strike.\n\nSome teachers at the Green Dot charter school network, represented by the Asociaci\u00c3\u00b3n de Maestros Unidos, which like UTLA is affiliated with the California Teachers Association, took paid time off to walk the picket lines with Los Angeles Unified teachers. Others made care packages at locations where Green Dot shares space with district-run schools.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf there are charter schools that are not meeting their enrollment, then there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s no point in operating a school that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not attracting families or students,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Angel Maldonado, president of the labor union that represents Green Dot teachers in California.\n\nWhile Maldonado called the demands of striking teachers \u00e2\u0080\u009cspot on,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s concerned that changes to how the district shares space with charter schools could lead to lost jobs for his members.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is something that would worry me,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, \u00e2\u0080\u009cand would worry a lot of my membership.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nShare Article", "title": "Beyond higher pay and smaller classes, charter debate is undercurrent of teachers strike in Los Angeles", "dataset": "auto_google", "labels": "['strike', 'school', 'working_condition']", "annot_city": "['Los Angeles']"}, {"id": 4517, "city": "Los Angeles", "url": "https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/lausd-teacher-strike-what-to-know-parents-help/5656/", "text": "After a tentative agreement was reached Tuesday, Los Angeles teachers will return to classrooms on Wednesday after a strike that stretched into six days, LA Mayor Eric Garcetti said.\n\nThe announcement comes after thousands of teachers and parents marched outside schools and in downtown LA last week.\n\nUnion leaders and district officials held a series of meetings through the weekend and the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday to try to come to a deal.\n\nGarcetti said that it came after a \"21-hour marathon session that wrapped up just before sunrise this morning.\"\n\nUTLA teachers went on strike Jan. 14, calling for smaller class sizes and the hiring of more support staff, such as nurses, counselors and librarians.\n\nIt was the first such teachers' strike in 30 years.\n\nFor the first time since 1989, teachers in Los Angeles went on strike.

This Saturday's game will mark the ninth time in NFL history that the Rams and Cowboys have met in the playoffs, which is notable, because no two teams have met more.\n\nAlthough they haven't played each other in the playoffs since 1985, these two teams have more postseason meetings than more glamorous rivalries like 49ers-Giants and Cowboys-Packers, which have both happened seven times in NFL playoff history.\n\nThe all-time playoff series between these two teams is tied 4-4 and the team that breaks the tie on Saturday will be getting a nice prize: A trip to the NFC Championship game. If the Cowboys pull off the upset, they'll be headed to their first NFC title game since January 1996. If the Rams can pick up their first playoff win under Sean McVay, they'll be headed to the NFC Championship for the first time since January 2002.\n\nGame information\n\nDate: Saturday, Jan. 12\n\nTime: 8:15 p.m. ET\n\nTV: Fox\n\nLocation: Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum\n\nStorylines\n\nCowboys: To get to their first NFC title game since 1995, the Cowboys are going to have to exorcise a few postseason demons this week. For one, the Cowboys have been one of the NFL's worst road playoff teams over the past 25 years. Since 1993, the Cowboys have gone on the road seven different times for a playoff game and they've lost every single one of those games, a total that includes one loss under Jason Garrett. The Cowboys have also struggled in the divisional round of the playoffs. Since their last NFC title berth in 1995, the Cowboys have gone 0-5 in the divisional round. After 25 years of struggling, the Cowboys will be looking to change their luck this week.\n\nAlthough the Cowboys should be at nearly full strength when they take the field in L.A., there are two injuries to keep an eye on. Wide receiver Cole Beasley has been dealing with an ankle injury all season and he got even more banged up during the Cowboys' win over Seattle on Saturday. There's no guarantee that Beasley will play and Jason Garrett has said that it will on come down to how Beasley feels as the week goes on. Another player dealing with an ankle injury is left guard Xavier Su'a-Filo, who didn't play against the Seahawks. Luckily for the Cowboys, it sounds like he's likely going to be on the field. Garrett said this week that he's \"optimistic\" that Su'a-Filo will play against the Rams, which would definitely be good news for a Cowboys offensive line that will be going up against Aaron Donald and Ndamukong Suh.\n\nRams: One of the biggest storylines in this game for the Rams will be the health of Todd Gurley. After sitting out the final two games of the regular season due to a knee injury, Gurley is expected to be on the field against the Cowboys, but it's not clear if he'll be 100 percent. Although C.J. Anderson filled in admirably while Gurley was out, averaging 149.5 yards per game, those two performances came against the Cardinals and 49ers, two teams that aren't nearly as good as the Cowboys when it comes to stopping the run. Not only did the Cowboys rank fifth in the NFL against the run in 2018, but they also completely shut down a Seahawks ground attack that finished the season as the league's top rushing team. The Rams are likely going to need a big game from Gurley if they want to advance.\n\nWhat needs to happen\n\nCowboys: The Cowboys offensive game plan on Saturday basically boils down to two words: Feed Zeke. If the Cowboys are going to pull off the upset in Los Angeles, they're going to need a big game from Ezekiel Elliott. The good news for the Cowboys is that if there's one team they should be able to run all over, it's the Rams. Although Aaron Donald led the NFL in sacks this year with 20.5, that didn't really help the Rams when it came to stopping the run. During the regular season, the Rams surrendered 5.1 yards per carry, which was the worst performance by any defense in the NFL in 2018. When going up against a defense like that, Elliott is basically the perfect weapon to have. Not only did the Cowboys running back lead the NFL in rush yards (1,434), but he also averaged 4.7 yards per carry during the regular season. In the Cowboys wild-card win over the Seahawks, Elliott totaled 169 yards and a touchdown (137 yards and a touchdown on the ground, 32 yards through the air).\n\nRams: The Rams need Jared Goff to get off to a hot start so he doesn't lose any confidence. Although the Rams lit up the scoreboard during the final two weeks of the season by scoring 48 and 31 points, those games came against bad teams in the 49ers and Cardinals. In the two weeks before that, the Rams played two playoff teams -- the Bears and Eagles -- and Goff struggled big time, throwing five interceptions and zero touchdowns in two games that the Rams ended up losing. Goff also struggled in his only playoff appearance last season, a game the Rams lost to the Falcons 26-13. The Rams were limited to just 13 points against the Falcons after leading the NFL in scoring in 2017, and a big reason for that was because Goff never got on track. Aaron Donald and Todd Gurley are important players for the Rams, but they can still win if either of those guys has an off day. However, the Rams have almost no chance of winning if Goff has an ugly game.\n\nGame prediction\n\nPoint spread: Rams, -7 points\n\nThe Rams have one glaring weakness this year -- stopping the run -- and unfortunately for L.A., the Cowboys are the one team left in the playoffs that's perfectly built to exploit that weakness. Ezekiel Elliott is probably licking his chops at the thought of going up against the Rams defense and it won't be surprising at all if he has a huge night with 150 rushing yards or more. If the Rams can jump out to a big early lead, they might be able to get the Cowboys away from their ground game, but that won't be easy. The guess here: Zeke runs wild as the Cowboys pull off the upset win.\n\nThe pick: Cowboys 23-20 over Rams", "title": "Dallas Cowboys vs. Los Angeles Rams Prediction, pick, odds, spread, line, complete game preview", "dataset": "auto_google", "labels": "['sport_news']", "annot_city": "[]"}, {"id": 4519, "city": "Los Angeles", "url": "https://www.turfshowtimes.com/2019/1/23/18193028/la-rams-at-no-saints-5-saints-to-watch-revisited-brees-kamara-thomas-ingram-lattimore", "text": "The Los Angeles Rams are going to the Superbowl after exacting regular season revenge and defeating the New Orleans Saints in the NFC Championship game.

UTLA President Alex Caputo-Pearl acknowledged its significance at the press conference announcing the contract agreement in City Hall this week.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cObviously, this is a crucial moment for unions in the United States,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said, at a time when \u00e2\u0080\u009ca lot of people are questioning\u00e2\u0080\u009d their future.\n\nThe L.A. strike, Caputo-Pearl suggested, should put that issue to rest.\n\nThe strike was a declaration that public sector unions are still alive. Instead of being weakened by the Janus ruling, UTLA was able to mobilize tens of thousands of teachers and generate support from other teachers around the state in a show of statewide unity not seen in decades.\n\nThe importance of the strike was underscored by the on-the-ground presence of the leaders of the largest teacher organizations in the nation: Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, and Lily Eskelsen Garcia of the National Education Association.\n\nAs Mayor Eric Garcetti noted, the strike \u00e2\u0080\u009cwas painful and had a cost.\u00e2\u0080\u009d But it should boost the spirits of labor organizers nationally, especially teachers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 unions waging similar battles. The strike settlement came at a time when unions struggle to maintain a firm foothold in the labor market. Union membership has now reached historic lows, according to a report issued last week by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In 2018, only 6.4 percent of workers in the private sector belonged to a union.\n\nBut if there has been any bright spot, it is in the public sector, where unions are still strong, with a unionization rate five times that of the private sector. In California, those rates are much higher than national ones. About 59 percent of public sector workers in California belonged to a union last year, according to the UC Berkeley Labor Center, compared to about 34 percent nationally.\n\nIn this strike, teachers were bargaining from a position of strength. Public opinion polls show that teachers are generally respected and that most Americans think teachers are underpaid. During the strike, they enjoyed widespread support from parents and others in Los Angeles. That was strengthened by union demands for more counselors and other support staff who arguably would benefit children and their families more than teachers. The strategy appeared to be influenced, intentionally or not, by a new approach to organizing called \u00e2\u0080\u009cbargaining for the common good.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAlso UTLA currently is arguably in the strongest position it could hope to be in the wake of the Janus decision, whose longer term impact has yet to be felt. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s because the union has so far been able to convince most teachers to opt into the union and pay their union fees, even though they are no longer mandatory.\n\nBut these were mostly teachers who have become accustomed to paying dues, the ones most likely to be most appreciative of the union\u00e2\u0080\u0099s value. Over time, as newer and younger teachers come into the profession, they may not feel the same allegiance, especially as they cope with the impact of high housing costs and they make tough decisions about where and how to spend their lowly beginning teacher salaries.\n\nNow the union must assess what it has gained and what it has lost as a result of the strike. One unfortunate outcome is that the district said it lost an estimated $125 million in state funds it would have received if students had been in school, although that amount was offset by the approximately $60 million it saved in not have to pay teacher and other salaries. The district now may be in even weaker financial shape than it was before the strike, and many questions remain as to how it will pay for everything it agreed to at the bargaining table.\n\nBut it is clear that, for now, the union is still a potent force, despite ongoing efforts to weaken it and render it irrelevant in Los Angeles and California.\n\nShare Article", "title": "Outcome of Los Angeles teachers' strike crucial for labor movement nationally", "dataset": "auto_google", "labels": "['redundant']", "annot_city": "[]"}, {"id": 4521, "city": "Los Angeles", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/28/us/charter-schools-los-angeles.html", "text": "Charter schools, which are generally not unionized, were not officially on the bargaining table in the protracted negotiations between the union and the district. It is the state, not the school district, that crafts the laws governing charter schools and their growth. But it was always a central message of the union during the strike: Charter schools, they argued, were taking students and money away from traditional public schools.\n\nStill, charter schools have proven popular among many parents in Los Angeles. Some schools have long waiting lists and the district already has more students enrolled in charters than any other public school system in the country.\n\nIt is still unclear how much practical impact the deal will have on charters. Charter school supporters are lobbying the school board, which has steadfastly supported charters for more than a decade, to vote down the resolution for a charter school cap this week. Even if it passes, advocates are certain to take the fight to Sacramento, where a bill calling for a moratorium seems likely. They will argue that charters have given poor students and students of color essential options for better schools.\n\nBut the defeat in the court of public opinion is clear: After years of support from powerful local and national allies \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including many Democrats \u00e2\u0080\u0094 charter schools are now facing a backlash and severe skepticism.\n\nOver the past two years, charter school supporters were dealt painful political defeats in California, New York, Massachusetts, Illinois, Michigan, Wisconsin and other states.\n\nAs the push for alternatives to traditional public schools has come to be more associated with President Trump and his secretary of education, Betsy DeVos, the shift in Democratic Party politics has been especially pronounced. President Barack Obama supported expanding high-quality charter schools, and pushed teachers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 unions to let go of some of their traditional seniority protections and put more emphasis on raising student achievement.", "title": "Success of Los Angeles Teachers Strike Rocks Charter Schools, and a Rich Supporter", "dataset": "auto_google", "labels": "['redundant']", "annot_city": "[]"}, {"id": 4522, "city": "Chicago", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/former-chicago-police-officer-jason-van-dyke-sentenced-to-more-than-6-years-for-killing-laquan-mcdonald/2019/01/18/e3c0e140-1b38-11e9-8813-cb9dec761e73_story.html", "text": "Please enable cookies on your web browser in order to continue.\n\nThe new European data protection law requires us to inform you of the following before you use our website:\n\nWe use cookies and other technologies to customize your experience, perform analytics and deliver personalized advertising on our sites, apps and newsletters and across the Internet based on your interests.

He was a four-star quarterback who starred at high school powerhouse Bishop Gorman High School in Las Vegas, and his story was chronicled in the Netflix series \"QB1: Beyond the Lights.\" Of course Martell was going to be popular, given that backstory by the time he arrived on campus \u00e2\u0080\u0094 maybe too popular, given the comparisons to former Texas A&M quarterback Johnny Manziel.\n\nYou could argue that exposure makes a quarterback more prepared for FBS competition, or more likely to transfer. There's truth to both sides.\n\nMartell didn't play much as a freshman behind J.T. Barrett in 2017, but he launched into a three-way quarterback battle with Dwayne Haskins and Joe Burrow last spring with the expectation he would play.\n\n\"There will be packages (for me to contribute) if I don't win the starting job,\" Martell told reporters during spring practice.\n\nHaskins won the starting job and finished third in the Heisman Trophy voting. Burrow transferred to LSU as a graduate transfer. Martell played in small doses and showed some of that playmaking ability that made him a viral sensation at Ohio State.\n\nThat was evident in the opener against Oregon State on Sept. 1, when Martell bolted into the secondary before launching a sideways pitch to C.J. Saunders for a first down.\n\n\"From my angle I thought he fumbled the ball, so my heart jumped out of my throat,\" Ohio State acting coach Ryan Day said afterward. \"He was actually being Tate, which is he's a playmaker. \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 That's what he did there. He's a playmaker. So, as the season goes on, he'll have more and more opportunities to show that.\"\n\nMartell finished 10 of 10 for 121 yards with 95 rushing yards and two total touchdowns in mop-up duty against Rutgers the next week, but he wasn't used much more than that. He finished with 269 passing yards, 128 rushing yards and three touchdowns this season, but was still a polarizing talent with the fan base.\n\nIt still appeared Martell would be the odds-on favorite to take over for the Buckeyes in 2019. With Day taking over for Urban Meyer, however, Martell's future at Ohio State was questioned before it even started. Martell's situation was impacted by Justin Fields, a five-star recruit who transferred from Georgia after just one season with the Bulldogs and will apply for hardship waiver that would allow him to play right away at Ohio State.\n\nWhen two highly touted recruits collide, this is going to happen every time. That's one issue with this trend, and an adjustment fans will be forced to make as quarterbacks come and go. The veneer of commitment between coach and quarterback \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and player and school \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is thinner now than it's ever been. Ohio State is not the exception. Look at SN's pre-preseason top 25, where nine of the top 10 schools have been affected by the transfer market in the past year.\n\nMORE: SN's pre-preseason top 25 for 2019\n\nKelly Bryant and Hunter Johnson transferred once it was clear the Trevor Lawrence era was in effect at Clemson. Notre Dame's Brandon Wimbush transferred to UCF. Jalen Hurts \u00e2\u0080\u0094 who led Alabama to two College Football Playoff championship games \u00e2\u0080\u0094 transferred to Oklahoma. Then Oklahoma's Austin Kendall, after initially being blocked, transferred to West Virginia.\n\nIt's a dizzying process for both sides. You can't blame Day for taking in a five-star transfer. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s his job to win football games and bring in competition at every position.\n\nYou also can't blame Martell for leaving either, even when he told reporters at Ohio State's Rose Bowl media day he was \"100 percent sure\" he would be the starting quarterback at Ohio State next season.\n\nTate Martell was asked who is going to be the next starting quarterback at Ohio State.\n\n\"I will.\"\n\nLevel of confidence?\n\n\"I'm 100-percent sure on that.\" \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Austin Ward (@AWardSports) December 30, 2018\n\nThings change. You could say Martell didn't want to compete with Fields or that the Buckeyes have their mind made up about the future. In reality, this was the best chance for both quarterbacks to play.\n\nThat's also life in the transfer portal, and that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why the fact a school lands a four- or five-star quarterback doesn't mean quite as much as it used to. The impact for Ohio State could be felt if Fields is not granted the waiver, and that would open the door for Matthew Baldwin to start. Martell could also apply for a waiver, perhaps based on the coaching change, but if the NCAA allows that, it opens the door for even more transfers.\n\nThat is a lot of paperwork. It's becoming clear the graduate transfer rule, which allows players to play immediately if they graduate from the previous school, will not be enough to slow the influx of transfer quarterbacks. What are the possible solutions? Will the NCAA eventually allow players to transfer without sitting out a year? What kind of restrictions for the players or schools come with?\n\nThat will take time, but a more player-friendly transfer system will only help \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and deflect from the ongoing pay-for-play argument. After all, this is a world where Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh just offered a seventh-grade quarterback a scholarship.\n\nSure, this happens at other positions, but it will always be most visible at quarterback. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only intensifying as they seem more prepared for the next level \u00e2\u0080\u0094 but perhaps not ready to accept there's only one spot available to start.\n\nWhich circles back to Martell, who is the first big get for new Miami coach Manny Diaz. That decision helped Hurricanes receiver Jeff Thomas leave the transfer portal. Martell, whether in 2019 or 2020, will be a playmaker for the Hurricanes at a position in which the team struggled last season. You can ask why Martell can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t play right now, or question the circumstances around his departure from Ohio State \u00e2\u0080\u0094 and on some level you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d be right both ways.\n\nThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life in the transfer portal, and Martell is right back like he never left.\n\nOr, in this case, still waiting to get a chance to be a starting quarterback.", "title": "Tate Martell's transfer to Miami shows what's right and wrong with QB shuffle", "dataset": "auto_google", "labels": "['sport_news']", "annot_city": "[]"}, {"id": 4534, "city": "Miami", "url": "https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/sports/2019/01/11/alabama-qb-coach-dan-enos-named-miami-oc/2548337002/", "text": "QB coach Enos is latest member of Alabama's coaching staff exodus\n\nTUSCALOOSA \u00e2\u0080\u0094 The exodus of Nick Saban's assistant coaching staff continued into Friday after the University of Miami announced the hiring of now-former Alabama quarterbacks coach Dan Enos as the Hurricanes' new offensive coordinator.\n\nEnos, who was reportedly rumored to be the front-runner to replace Mike Locksley as the Crimson Tide's offensive coordinator, left Alabama after just a season in Tuscaloosa, where he was viewed as instrumental to the development of the Crimson Tide's record-breaking passing attack this season.

Gattis was named the Wolverines' offensive coordinator Thursday afternoon, while Key returned to his alma mater with the elevated titles of associate head coach and run game coordinator in addition to his offensive line coach responsibilities.\n\nSpecial teams coordinator and tight ends coach Jeff Banks and running backs coach Joe Pannunzio are all that's left of last season's offensive staff, which helped set multiple single-season program records in 2018.\n\nUnder Enos' tutelage as quarterbacks coach, Alabama sophomore Tua Tagovailoa reset the standard for quarterbacks in Tuscaloosa, throwing for a single-season record 3,966 passing yards and 43 touchdowns en route to finishing as the Heisman Trophy runner-up this season.

According to prosecutors, the teen fought officers who tried to use their Taser.\n\nEventually, he was placed in handcuffs on the ground.

However, his tenure with that team lasted less than three weeks as he was hired less than 10 hours after Mark Richt announced his retirement.\n\nMiami will reportedly pay $4 million to Temple as part of Diaz\u00e2\u0080\u0099s contract buyout.\n\nDuring the 2018 season, the offense struggled for a Miami team who has lost nine of their last 16 games after starting last season 10-0. The Hurricanes ranked 105th in the FBS out of 130 teams in total offense and 113th in passing last season.\n\nThe Canes were held to just three points in their blowout loss to Wisconsin in the Pinstripe Bowl last week, leading to calls for Richt to make changes to the coaching staff that including firing his son as well as relinquishing play calling duties.\n\nRicht, who returned to his alma mater after 15 seasons as a head coach at Georgia and 15 before that as a top assistant coach at Florida State, instead stepped down for what he called the \u00e2\u0080\u009cbest interest\u00e2\u0080\u009d of the program.\n\nDuring his first interview after returning to Miami, Diaz said that finding help on offense \u00e2\u0080\u0094 from a coordinator to a quarterback and more \u00e2\u0080\u0094 is at the top of his list of priorities\n\n\"In terms of establishing the identity of what we're going to be on offense and what that vision should be, it's very similar to what we've been on defense,\" Diaz said on WQAM, the Hurricanes' flagship station. \"We came here three years ago and set a vision of how the Miami Hurricanes play defense and what in my mind fits best for the talent that's available to us here in South Florida.\"\n\nDiaz stayed with the Hurricanes through last week's Pinstripe Bowl. He returned to Miami on Friday and spent the weekend putting together what he thought would be his Temple coaching staff.\n\nBut around midday Sunday, Diaz's wife heard the news that Richt stepped down.\n\nCraziness ensued from there.\n\n\"It's been wild. There's no other way to explain it,\" Diaz said in the radio interview. \"It's something that when everybody woke up yesterday morning, no one could have predicted. They don't write scripts for these things. If they did they would get thrown in the trash because no one would believe it.\"\n\nDefense has been the much stronger side of the ball for Miami during Diaz's three years at the school. Under Diaz, Miami has allowed 4.6 yards per play \u00e2\u0080\u0094 among all other Football Bowl Subdivision schools, only Alabama (4.2), Clemson (4.4), Michigan (4.4) and Washington (4.55) have allowed less in that three-year span.\n\nThe offense hasn't had the same success, and struggled mightily this year. So far this season, with some bowl games left, 73 different quarterbacks have thrown for more yards by themselves than Miami did as a team in 2018. Diaz said returnees N'Kosi Perry and Jarren Williams will have a chance to win the job, but made clear that he's also going to look at transfers.\n\n\"If you don't have excellence at that position, it's very hard to compete in this day and age,\" Diaz said. \"We've got some guys on campus who have been in the system and I think this is their time now to turn the page and decide whether they're capable of being the starting quarterback at the University of Miami. But at the same time we've got to create competition because competition is the best coach there is.\"\n\nDiaz, who will hold a news conference later this week, also told WQAM that he felt badly about how the situation transpired for Temple and spoke again about how thankful he was that the Owls gave him their job.\n\nHe also insisted that, with the late part of recruiting season looming and staffing decisions to make, he needs to move on quickly. His first game as coach of the Hurricanes is Aug. 31 against rival Florida.", "title": "New Miami Hurricanes Head Coach Manny Diaz Fires Every Offensive Assistant Report", "dataset": "auto_google", "labels": "['sport_news']", "annot_city": "[]"}, {"id": 4538, "city": "Dallas", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/cowboys-vs-seahawks-final-score-takeaways-dallas-rides-ezekiel-elliott-to-wild-playoff-win-over-seattle/", "text": "There's a reason they call it the wild-card round, and the reason is because you get wildly entertaining games like the one played on Saturday night in Dallas.\n\nIn a game that wasn't decided until Dallas recovered an onside kick with 1:16 left to play, the Cowboys outlasted the Seahawks 24-22 for a win that will now be sending Jason Garrett's team to the divisional round next week against either the Saints or the Rams.\n\nTo pick up their first playoff win in four years, the Cowboys did what they they've done a lot of this season: They fed Ezekiel Elliott.\n\nElliott, who finished 2018 as the NFL's leading rusher with 1,434 yards, slowly wore down the Seahawks defense on a night where he carried the ball 26 times for 137 yards and a touchdown. Elliott tends to shine in the fourth quarter, and that's exactly what he did against Seattle.\n\nWith just 7:20 left to play and the Cowboys clinging to a 17-14 lead, Dallas needed to put together a time-consuming drive, and so they decided to feed Zeke. On an 11-play drive that ran 5:12 off the clock and essentially iced the game, Elliott carried the ball five times for 31 yards. The Seahawks could only watch as precious seconds ticked away after each one of Elliott's carries.\n\nElliott's performance on the drive set up Dak Prescott for a one-yard score that proved to be the game-winning touchdown.\n\nAlthough Elliott came up big on that fourth quarter drive, he did most of his damage in the first half, when he carried the ball 13 times for 91 yards. One of the biggest plays of the game came on a third-and-1 for the Cowboys with just 1:09 left to play until halftime. At the time, Dallas was trailing 6-3 and If they didn't convert the third down from their own 34-yard line, they would have had to punt the ball back to Seattle.\n\nNot only did Elliott get the one yard for the first down, but he also tacked on 43 more yards to set the Cowboys up at the Seahawks' 22-yard line.\n\nThe run was pivotal because it gave the Cowboys a chance to get a touchdown right before halftime. With just 24 seconds left to play in the second quarter, Prescott hit Michael Gallup for a score that put the Cowboys up 14-10 at the half.\n\nPrescott wasn't perfect in this game, but he did more than enough to keep the pressure off Elliott. Not to mention, the Cowboys quarterback came through when the team needed him the most. In a play that basically saved the win for the Cowboys, Prescott converted a third-and-14 by pulling off a miraculous 16-yard run with under 2:45 left to play in the game.\n\nOverall, Prescott rushed for 29 yards to go along with his 226-yard passing performance.\n\nIf the Cowboys win the Super Bowl, they might want to send a ring to Jon Gruden, and that's because most of Prescott's passing yardage went to former Raiders receiver Amari Cooper. Cooper continued to come up big for the Cowboys and this time, he did it with a seven-catch, 106-yard performance that included the 34-yard reception you can see below.\n\nThat catch, which came in the fourth quarter, set up a one-yard touchdown run by Elliott that gave the Cowboys the lead for good at 17-14.\n\nThe Cowboys' new version of the triplets seems to be catching fire at the right time, and there's no reason to think that this team can't upset either the Saints or the Rams next week.\n\nDallas D puts clamps on Seahawks run game\n\nDuring the 2018 season, the Seahawks led the NFL in rushing with 160 yards per game, but they got nowhere close to that number in Dallas. Going up against a relentless Cowboys defense, the Seahawks were only able to muster 73 yards on 24 carries. The numbers are actually even uglier than that if you consider that 28 of those yards came on one carry, which means that Seattle gained just 45 yards on their 23 other rushes (1.96 yards per carry).\n\nSeahawks running back Chris Carson, who finished the season with 1,151 yards, had nowhere to run. At halftime, he had just 16 yards and he was only able to tack on four more in the second half. Cowboys linebacker Leighton Vander Esch, who's a strong Defensive Rookie of the Year candidate, was all over the field with 10 tackles. One key part of the Seahawks rushing attack is Russell Wilson, but he was mostly ineffective thanks to a perfectly designed defensive strategy from the Cowboys. For most of the game, the Cowboys had a shadow on Wilson to prevent the Seahawks quarterback from doing any damage with his legs, and the plan worked, because Wilson only rushed for 17 yards.\n\nSeahawks help stop the Seahawks\n\nAlthough the Cowboys deserve a lot of credit for shutting down the Seahawks offense, they also got some help from Seahawks offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer, who seemed lost calling plays. For the most part, the Seahawks spent the game running on first and second down, then hoping that Russell Wilson could bail them out on third down.\n\nThe problem for the Seahawks is that kind of offensive strategy just doesn't work when you're playing a defense as good as the Cowboys. Although Wilson had an impressive night (18 of 27, 233 yards, one touchdown), none of his magic was working on third down with the Seahawks going just 2 of 13 on third down conversions.\n\nSchottenheimer's obsession with sticking with something that wasn't working (the run game) didn't make any sense, and that's mostly because Wilson came up huge when he was actually allowed to throw. For instance, the Seahawks quarterback single-handedly kept his team in the game when he converted a fourth-and-6 in the third quarter with this perfect throw to Doug Baldwin.\n\nThe crazy thing is that Wilson was making throws like that all game. The Seahawks quarterback would put the ball where only his receiver could get it, and then his receiver would make a huge play. Here's a look at a 25-yard pass that Tyler Lockett caught in the second quarter.\n\nSchottenheimer's desire to stay with a run game that absolutely wasn't working turned the Seahawks into a one-dimensional team that the Cowboys easily shut down. Lockett, who caught four passes for 120 yards, was one of the few bright spots for the Seahawks offense.\n\nHome-field advantage is alive and well at Jerry World\n\nAlthough Seattle is known as a tough place to play, it's the Cowboys that have actually had one of the best home-field advantages in the NFL this year. Dallas finished the regular season with a 7-1 record at Jerry World, which was tied for the best home record in the NFC. The Cowboys asked their fans to wear white on Saturday to match the team's white uniforms, and let's just say, the fans in Dallas came through.\n\nEveryone loves to joke about Cowboys fans being bandwagon jumpers, but the fact of the matter is that this fan base has stood by the organization for nearly 25 years even though the Cowboys haven't come anywhere close to sniffing a Super Bowl since 1995. You could tell the fans in Dallas were eager to see the win on Saturday, and they came out in full force to AT&T Stadium to give the Cowboys a true home-field advantage against the Seahawks.\n\nThe Cowboys could actually end up hosting one more game this postseason, but that would only happen if they end up playing the Eagles, which means the Cowboys would need Philadelphia to somehow put together another magical playoff run. If the Eagles and Cowboys meet in the NFC Championship, the game would be played in Dallas on Jan. 20.\n\nAllen Hurns carted off after gruesome injury\n\nThe Cowboys lost Allen Hurns for the night after he suffered an ugly injury midway through the first quarter. The injury happened after Hurns caught a big 14-yard pass on a third-and-7 play for the Cowboys. As Hurns was fighting to get a few more yards, he got hit by Seahawks safety Bradley McDougald, who came down on the receiver's left ankle. In what can only be described as one of the most gruesome injuries you'll ever see, McDougald's body weight snapped Hurns' ankle. The game had to be stopped for nearly 10 minutes so trainers could take care of Hurns and get him carted off the field.\n\nThe good news is that Hurns was able to give a thumbs up before he was taken off the field.\n\nCowboys WR Allen Hurns gives a thumbs up to the crowd after suffering a gruesome ankle injury. pic.twitter.com/Q91mPsY5ed \u00e2\u0080\u0094 FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) January 6, 2019\n\nCowboys owner Jerry Jones revealed after the game that Hurns immediately underwent surgery after leaving the stadium. According to Jones, Hurns dislocated his ankle and fractured his knee.\n\nKicker problems\n\nOne storyline that was hanging over the second half of this game was the health of Sebastian Janikowski. The Seahawks kicker injured himself while attempting a 57-yard field goal at the end of the first half, and by the start of the third quarter, he had been ruled doubtful to return before eventually being ruled out. That left the kicking duties to Seahawks punter Michael Dickson, who isn't exactly known for his ability to placekick.\n\nUm, if this comes down to a field goal, the Seahawks might be in trouble. #SEAvsDAL #Cowboys #Seahawks pic.twitter.com/g4Iolwq1FB \u00e2\u0080\u0094 John Breech (@johnbreech) January 6, 2019\n\nDickson was missing field goals left and right during his halftime warm-up, and apparently, things were so bad that Pete Carroll decided not to attempt any kicks in the second half.\n\nThe Seahawks scored two touchdowns in the second half and after each score, Carroll decided to go for two (the Seahawks scored on both conversions). Although Dickson wasn't forced to try a game-winning field goal, he did kill any chances Seattle had of winning when botched the onside kick with 1:16 left to play. Someone must have forgotten to tell Dickson that an onside kick only needs to go 10 yards, because he sent it more than 30 yards down the field.\n\nWorst onside kick ever of all time pic.twitter.com/2Ol4FiulXW \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Barstool Sports (@barstooltweetss) January 6, 2019\n\nThe big kick was good news for Cole Beasley, who made the easiest onside recovery of his life.\n\nUp next\n\nAlthough the Cowboys will definitely be playing in the Divisional Round next week, they won't find out who they're playing until after the Eagles-Bears game on Sunday. If the favored Bears come away with the win, then the Cowboys will be headed for New Orleans in a game that would be played on January 13. This will be a rematch of a Week 13 game played in Dallas where the Cowboys upset the Saints 13-10. On the other hand, if the Eagles pull off the upset in Chicago, then Dallas will be headed to Los Angeles for a Saturday night showdown with the Rams.\n\nAs for the Seahawks, their season is now over, which means they can start focusing on things like the combine and free agency. The Seahawks can also turn their eyes to the draft. Since they were eliminated in the wild-card round, the Seahawks will pick either 21st or 22nd during the first round of the 2019 NFL Draft.\n\nIf you want to keep reading about the game, you can re-live everything from the Cowboys' win in our blog below.", "title": "Cowboys vs. Seahawks final score, takeaways Dallas rides Ezekiel Elliott to wild playoff win over Seattle", "dataset": "auto_google", "labels": "['sport_news']", "annot_city": "[]"}, {"id": 4539, "city": "Dallas", "url": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/25749749/terrell-owens-calls-jason-garrett-job-once-again-dallas-cowboys-loss", "text": "Hall of Fame wide receiver Terrell Owens took another shot at Cowboys coach Jason Garrett after Dallas' divisional-round playoff loss to the Los Angeles Rams on Saturday.\n\nAfter the Cowboys' 30-22 loss, Owens tweeted at team owner Jerry Jones saying he should consider moving on from Garrett.\n\nHey @realjerryjones!

(Photo by Brian Blanco/Getty Images)\n\nDespite having posted a 10-6 regular season and a playoff win, could the Dallas Cowboys still replace head coach Jason Garrett with Sean Payton?\n\nIn January of 2007, Bill Parcells retired as the head coach of the Dallas Cowboys after a four-year run. For the first three of those four seasons, Sean Payton was the Cowboys\u00e2\u0080\u0099 assistant head coach, quarterbacks\u00e2\u0080\u0099 coach and eventually became the passing game coordinator as well.\n\nPayton was as close to being the Cowboys\u00e2\u0080\u0099 head coach under Parcells as one could get without the title. And he was responsible for bringing quarterback Tony Romo to Dallas. Many believe that if Parcells had retired one season earlier than Payton would have been the next head coach of America\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Team.\n\nInstead, Payton became the head coach of the New Orleans Saints in 2006. He would lead the struggling franchise to their first and only Super Bowl victory just four years later. Now, he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s on the cusp of leading the Saints to yet another Super Bowl appearance as New Orleans will face off against the Los Angeles Rams this weekend in the NFC Championship game.\n\nIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a postseason matchup the Cowboys are forced to watch from the comfort of their own homes as Dallas was eliminated from playoff contention last weekend by those same Rams.\n\nFollowing a successful year where the Cowboys bounced back from a 3-5 start to end the season with a 10-6 record, winning the NFC East title and posting a playoff victory over the Seattle Seahawks in the Wild Card round; it appears on the surface that head coach Jason Garrett has earned himself a contract extension in Dallas.\n\nAlthough Garrett has another year left on his current deal, the Cowboys are rumored to want to lock up the nine-year head coach for the foreseeable future. But the good folks over at Pro Football Talk seem to think that owner and general manager Jerry Jones may be leaving the door open for another head coach to take the helm of the Cowboys soon.\n\nRELATED PRODUCT Dallas Cowboys Womens White Fur Boots Buy Now!

And Payton\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future in New Orleans is likely tied to the game this weekend and the future of 40-year old quarterback Drew Brees. The Saints\u00e2\u0080\u0099 head coach is also under contract through 2020, which would be another obstacle to tackle.\n\nThe recent firing of Scott Linehan as offensive coordinator could be an indication that Garrett will remain in Dallas, especially if the Cowboys hire another OC anytime soon. The team has been reportedly interviewing candidates and you\u00e2\u0080\u0099d think if Payton was considered an option Dallas could hold off on hiring anyone until he was possibly available as a new head coach would certainly want to hire his own staff.\n\nThe biggest question is would Jerry Jones actually replace Jason Garrett after a successful season in Dallas? If he does, it likely has to do with who is available to replace Garrett and the fact the 76-year old Jones isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t getting any younger.", "title": "Is Sean Payton the Dallas Cowboys next head coach ", "dataset": "auto_google", "labels": "['sport_news']", "annot_city": "[]"}, {"id": 4541, "city": "Dallas", "url": "https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/01/bryce-dallas-howard-named-hasty-pudding-woman-of-the-year/", "text": "The Hasty Pudding Theatricals, the oldest theatrical organization in the United States, has named Bryce Dallas Howard as its 2019 Woman of the Year.

He allegedly used union funds to pay contractors for work at his South Philadelphia home and bar. And he put friends and family members on the union's payroll, showering them with raises and overtime for hours they didn't work and using them to do personal tasks, prosecutors said.Councilman Bobby Henon, a former union official, got a $70,000 union salary to press Dougherty's interests at City Hall, officials said in the indictment unsealed Wednesday. Henon used his office to pressure Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Comcast Corp. and others to use union labor, prosecutors said at a morning news conference.The union paid Dougherty $1.4 million between 2010 and 2016. He and the other defendants are due to appear in court Friday.His lawyer, Henry E. Hockeimer, said Dougherty has devoted \"all his energies\" to the union for a quarter century, leading to dramatic increases in wages and benefits. \"To allege that John in any way attempted to defraud the union he cares about so deeply is preposterous,\" Hockeimer said in a statement.The full statement read: Dougherty helped Mayor Jim Kenney win election in 2015 , the same year his brother, Kevin Dougherty, won a seat on the state Supreme Court. Henon, who rose through the union ranks to become its political director before winning a City Council seat in 2011, was charged with honest services fraud and other charges.T.J. Rooney, a former state Democratic Party chairman, said the political reach of the electricians' union under Dougherty \"in the region is unparalled and in the state is tremendously impactful.\"The electricians' union is easily the most influential private-sector labor union in Pennsylvania politics, rivaled only by public-sector labor unions, he said.Dougherty, however, is not \"some old-school cigar-chomping union boss,\" Rooney said. The union, under Dougherty, has expanded its numbers and profile through apprenticeship programs and its deep involvement in community projects and charitable missions, Rooney said.\"That's not old-timey, that's new-schooley,\" he said.Henon has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. The councilman's office said Wednesday that he will continue to serve.Henon issued the following statement after the charges were announced:The defendants include Henon, the majority leader on council and chair of the public property and public works committee; union president Brian Burrows, and union officials Michael Neill, Marita Crawford, Niko Rodriguez and Brian Fiocca - Dougherty's nephew. Also charged was Anthona Massa, who ran a construction company that received more than $1.8 million from the union for work done between 2010 and 2016.___Associated Press reporter Marc Levy in Harrisburg, Michael Rubinkam in northeastern Pennsylvania and Claudia Lauer in Philadelphia contributed to this report.-----", "title": "Feds indict powerful Philly union boss Johnny Doc Dougherty, Councilman Bobby Henon, others", "dataset": "auto_google", "labels": "['local_politics']", "annot_city": "[]"}, {"id": 4549, "city": "Philadelphia", "url": "https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/sports/philadelphia-wings-announcer-figured-derogatory-statement/5829/", "text": "What to Know Philadelphia Wings public address announcer Shawny Hill has been fired for a remark about Georgia Swarm forward Lyle Thompson during a game.\n\nThompson, who is from the Onondaga Reservation in central New York, said fans began to shout racially-charged remarks at him.\n\nHill apologized on social media for \"insensitive\" words he called \"poorly chosen\" and \"not intended as racially motivated.\"\n\nA public address announcer has lost his job over a remark about a Native American player during a lacrosse game that he and the Philadelphia team called \"insensitive.\"\n\nThe Philadelphia Wings said announcer Shawny Hill had been \"permanently removed\" from his role with the team and suspended from assignments at the Wells Fargo Center.\n\nGeorgia Swarm forward Lyle Thompson, of the Onondaga Reservation in central New York, said Hill said \"Let's snip the pony tail\" during Saturday night's game and fans then began to shout calls to \"scalp\" him.

She said he was a disabled veteran.\"Released on honorable discharged medical,\" Elizabeth Ferrari said. \"He had debilitating injuries for many years and it's a sad situation.\"Tuttle was married to Nicholas for 20 years. She also has family in Texas.Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo said the drug raid on the home stemmed from numerous complaints from neighbors. He said undercover officers had previously made two purchases of black tar heroin from drug dealers at the house.Armed with a search warrant, nine narcotics detectives backed up by at least six patrol officers surrounded the home just before 5 p.m. on Monday.After a 54-year-old officer, the lead investigator on the case, broke open the front door, a 33-year-old officer armed with a shotgun entered the residence and was immediately attacked by a pit bull, Acevedo said.He said that the officer being attacked shot and killed the dog.One of the suspects, Tuttle, charged from the back of the house firing a revolver at the officer, hitting him in the shoulder.\"He went down and fell on the sofa in the living room,\" Acevedo said of the wounded officer. \"A female suspect went towards that officer, reached over the officer and started making a move for his shotgun.\"Another officer who entered the house was allegedly shot by Tuttle.Acevedo said officers opened fire, killing Nicholas and engaged in a gun battle with Tuttle.He said the lead investigator who breached the door entered the house and was also shot.\"After we had two officers down and another shot, the remaining officers ... started laying down cover fire, left positions of cover themselves and, I believe, they heroically pulled their fellow officers out of harm's way,\" Acevedo said.He said Tuttle followed the retreating officers to the front door and continued to fire at them before he was shot and killed.Police recovered two shotguns and three rifles from the residence and seized marijuana and a white powder they believe to be either cocaine or the powerful synthetic opioid fentanyl, Acevedo said.Tuttle's sister says they are sending prayers to the officers.\"Our prayers are with the officers and the families that are affected,\" said Ferrari.", "title": "What we know about husband and wife killed in Houston officer-involved shooting", "dataset": "auto_google", "labels": "['crime_incident']", "annot_city": "['Houston']"}, {"id": 4559, "city": "Houston", "url": "https://www.npr.org/2019/01/06/682631402/police-in-houston-charge-suspect-with-murder-in-death-of-7-year-old-jazmine-barn", "text": "By choosing \u00e2\u0080\u009cI agree\u00e2\u0080\u009d below, you agree that NPR\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sites use cookies, similar tracking and storage technologies, and information about the device you use to access our sites to enhance your viewing, listening and user experience, personalize content, personalize messages from NPR\u00e2\u0080\u0099s sponsors, provide social media features, and analyze NPR\u00e2\u0080\u0099s traffic.

That would make him the highest-paid coach outside a Power Five conference ever, earning $1.4 million more than Mike Norvell did at Memphis in 2018 ($2.6 million). However, official details of Holgorsen's contract have not yet been officially released. Holgorsen was paid $3.7 million in salary this past season at West Virginia.\n\nY\u00e2\u0080\u0099all want to go win some games?\n\n\n\nLet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s go win some games!\n\n\n\nHelp us welcome Coach Dana Holgorsen to H-Town! #GoCoogs pic.twitter.com/rhZyjtc5xL \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Houston Football (@UHCougarFB) January 2, 2019\n\nHolgorsen is 61-41 in his time at WVU and has led the program for its entire Big 12 tenure; the Mountaineers joined the conference in 2012. West Virginia generally hovered between 7-8 wins under Holgorsen, though it posted a 10-3 campaign in 2016 that netted a second-place finish in the Big 12. Holgorsen previously served as offensive coordinator at Houston under Kevin Sumlin from 2008-09.\n\nHere's what you should know about the hire and what it means for Houston, Holgorsen and West Virginia ...\n\nThis is a good move for both parties. I've long held the belief that 2018 would be Holgorsen's last season at West Virginia for one reason or another. He's been there eight years, which in today's coaching world is an eternity. Only the legendary Don Nehlen won more games in Morgantown. Holgorsen, who is indisputably a brilliant offensive mind, is a fan of the Houston area. Having worked there in the past as a coordinator, he'll fit right in. Framing this move as a step down from the Power Five to Group of Five is missing the point; Holgorsen is going from a remote location that produces few Division I recruits and forces him to cast a wider net to freaking Houston. Texas, and Houston in particular, may be heavily mined for recruits, but Holgorsen will have a much easier time getting locally sourced high school players there -- especially quarterbacks.\n\nThat being said, Holgorsen was not without his shortcomings, a list of which would get away from the big picture. The reality is this team was Holgorsen's best team and he went 8-3 in the regular season, dropping his final two games vs. Oklahoma State and Oklahoma, the former of which was an absolute gut punch for the program's Big 12 Championship Game hopes. This past season always had a \"if not now, then when?\" vibe to it and the Mountaineers came up short. Holgorsen won 10 games twice, one of which came in his inaugural season. Granted, West Virginia can be a tough place to win, but failing to maximize its small window for something great put a lot of stress on this partnership. It was time for both sides to move on, especially with an obvious rebuild ahead.\n\nHowever, Holgorsen isn't escaping pressure, he's arriving for another round of it. The only thing Holgorsen bought with this move is more time. Had he returned to West Virginia in 2019 without a contract extension, which was extremely likely if he did return, Holgorsen maybe would have survived another year or two barring a pleasant surprise. Athletic director Shane Lyons did not hire Holgorsen and given the disappointment of this past season was understandably not incentivized to reward him.\n\nHouston was incentivized and that's great for Holgorsen, but by no means does this make his job easier. The university's president quite literally said in 2016 that the school would fire coaches for going 8-4. That's exactly what Holgorsen did in 2018 and his 15-10 record in the past two seasons is identical to Applewhite's record in two full seasons with the Cougars. And Houston is paying Holgorsen way more money than it did for Applewhite. This may be a good fit for Holgorsen, but a job is only as good as its bosses and Houston has high expectations for him with a trigger finger to boot.\n\nWhere does West Virginia look next? No, it's not Rich Rodriguez. It's not Butch Jones, either. West Virginia may not be an amazing job, but it doesn't need to hire a retread who left unceremoniously 11 years ago, nor a former assistant who drove Tennessee into the ground. It can do better and there are good enough candidates out there to not have to seriously consider either.

The dogged manhunt began with a description of a white man seen in a red pickup truck amid growing tensions that the shooting had been racially motivated.\n\nBut by the time the funeral began Tuesday, two black men \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including one suspected gang member \u00e2\u0080\u0094 had been charged with capital murder in the shooting. Investigators said the men apparently thought they were aiming at a group with whom they had an altercation hours earlier.\n\nWashington led the lengthy procession of family into the sanctuary on Pinemount Drive before the service. Jazmine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father, Christopher Cevilla, followed soon after as gospel music spilled into the hallway.\n\nCevilla offered his own tribute to his daughter, whom he referred to as \u00e2\u0080\u009cmy baby girl.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cGod bless me and my family, my angel,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Cevilla said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHe saw it fit to take her back to heaven. Her job here was done. She brought so much peace and unity to us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nJames Barnes, who helped raise Jazmine with her mother, also offered brief words during the service.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve cried for days. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve stayed awake for days,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he told mourners.\n\nAmong those attending the funeral were Mayor Sylvester Turner, U.S. Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee and Sheriff Ed Gonzalez, whose investigators led the charge in finding Jazmine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s killer.\n\nGonzalez\u00e2\u0080\u0099s condolences during the funeral came as a capital murder charge was lodged against the second man in Jazmine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death. His vows to bring Jazmine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s attackers to justice prompted applause from the packed church.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJazmine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life mattered,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gonzalez said.\n\nThe case, he said, was especially difficult for him and his investigators because it meant mourning \u00e2\u0080\u009ca life that may have been.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHer beautiful smile brought memories of our own children when they were second graders,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gonzalez said, recalling her aspiration to be a school teacher. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe was robbed of her dreams. This is our chance to make our community safer for children.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is our pledge to Jazmine: Rest in peace, sweet Jazmine, for justice has been done.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe mayor spoke of the random nature of Jazmine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cEven when it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s mistaken identity, the consequences can be deadly,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Turner told those gathered in the church. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe all have to take a look at ourselves and change our behavior because Jazmine was an innocent. She was blameless.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSheldon ISD Superintendent King Davis shared memories from Jazmine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s second grade teacher at Monahan Elementary.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJazmine had a sweet spirit,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe loved everyone and always wanted to love and take care of others. She enjoyed making pictures for her teacher and friends.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe funeral \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which was open to the public \u00e2\u0080\u0094 also brought Valencia Mason, who didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t know Jazmine or her family, from Humble. Her 5-year-old niece, Jannice Mason, joined her to support the family.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cShe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the age of my niece,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mason said, holding the child\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat touched me. It could have been any one of us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe shooting inspired an outpour of donations, with more than $82,000 going to a GoFundMe page Cevilla established and Houston Texans wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins promising his $29,000 gameday paycheck to help the family.\n\nThe funds, and any future donations, are slated for the Jazmine Barnes Education and Scholarship Fund at Frost Bank on West Loop South in Bellaire, said Bishop James Dixon, who presides over The Community of Faith Curch.\n\nThe fund will help educate Jazmine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s siblings, he said.\n\nA $100,000 reward compiled by civil rights activist Shaun King to encourage tipsters has not been distributed, according to Dixon. He said King and lawyer Lee Merritt did not attend the funeral.\n\nA tip that helped apprehend the suspects was sent to King and then emailed to Gonzalez last week.\n\nA capital murder charge was filed late Saturday against Eric Black Jr., 20, who told investigators he was the driver but did not fire the shots. A capital murder charge was filed against a separate suspect, Larry Woodruffe, 24, who has been jailed on a drug charge since Saturday.\n\nJazmine was in the back seat of a car when a gunman opened fire on them from another vehicle. One of the bullets struck her in the head as the family approached a Walmart. Her mother was struck in the arm, and was still wearing a sling on her left arm at the funeral. Two of the other girls were injured by flying glass.\n\nAfter the service, and as the casket was carried out, Washington sobbed into the arms of Jazmine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s grandmother, who earlier collapsed with grief during the viewing. She was ushered out.\n\nThe family gathered outside the church with mourners to release more than a dozen purple balloons in Jazmine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s memory. One of the balloons nearly escaped from the cluster \u00e2\u0080\u0094 a signal, her mother said, that Jazmine was anxious to set them free.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAmen,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dixon, the bishop.\n\nWashington looked up as the balloons lofted above Acres Homes.", "title": "Community remembers 'Princess Jazmine' at funeral service", "dataset": "auto_google", "labels": "['not_sure']", "annot_city": "[]"}, {"id": 4562, "city": "Houston", "url": "https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Activists-claim-deadly-shooting-of-7-year-old-13503502.php", "text": "Activist claims deadly shooting of 7-year-old Houston girl was racially motivated\n\nJazmine Barnes, 7, was shot and killed Sunday morning as her family drove to Walmart.

As far as investigators know, the family did nothing to spark the gunman's ire and he made no attempt to communicate before opening fire around 6:50 a.m. from the next lane over.\n\nDetectives with HCSO's homicide division said the shooter was a white male with a beard driving a red pickup truck. The vehicle was spotted by security cameras nearby.\n\nAn outcry of support started pouring in from all around the country, including from nationally known civil rights activist Shaun King \u00e2\u0080\u0093 who propped up a $50,000 cash reward to help catch Jazmine's killer.\n\n\"We must find the evil coward who murdered 7-year-old Jazmine Barnes,\" King tweeted along with a video of the young girl. \"We must. We have some leads already, but they aren't good enough. Keep pushing.\"\n\nMuhammad said he believes he and several other activists have a lead of their own on the case, which revolves around a shooting on Aug. 30, 2017, in the same vicinity.\n\nDuring that shooting, then-21-year-old A'vonta Williams was driving along Garrett Road near East Beltway 8 to go check on his girlfriend in the wake of Hurricane Harvey when he was shot by a white male in a Ford F-150.\n\nWilliams was struck in both legs, and his grandmother, who was also in the car with him, was shot in the hip.\n\nWilliams' family claimed that detectives failed to investigate the shooting for months but have yet to make an arrest in the case.\n\n\"If A'vonta Williams' shooter had been found, would Jazmine Barnes still be alive?\" Muhammad said. \"... What are the odds that two black families were fired upon by a white male in a pickup truck within a one-year time span on the same block? We've got to call it what it is. Black people are being targeted in this country. Black people are being targeted in this county. Black people are being targeted in this city. We are thoroughly convinced that the killing of Jazmine Barnes was race related.\"\n\nWilliams shooting and Jazmine's shooting happened about six miles apart.\n\nThe only connections Muhammad made between the shootings were that both shooters were white males who shot black victims in that area of Harris County, which he claimed has \"a very strong white supremacist element\" in the area.\n\nHe also noted that both shooters were driving pickup trucks, although Jazmine's shooter was behind the wheel of a red four-door pickup while Williams' shooter was driving a gray pickup.\n\nAnyone with information about Jazmine's shooter is urged to call Houston Crime Stoppers at 731-222-TIPS (8477).\n\nJay R.

(Texas Department of Criminal Justice via AP)\n\nHUNTSVILLE, Texas (AP) \u00e2\u0080\u0094 A 61-year-old Texas inmate was executed Wednesday evening for killing a Houston police officer more than three decades ago.\n\nRobert Jennings received lethal injection for the July 1988 fatal shooting of Officer Elston Howard during a robbery at an adult bookstore that authorities said was part of a crime spree.\n\nAs witnesses filed into the death chamber, Jennings asked a chaplain standing next to him if he knew the name of the slain officer. The chaplain didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t appear to respond, and a prison official then told the warden to proceed with the punishment.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cTo my friends and family, it was a nice journey,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Jennings said in his final statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cTo the family of the police officer, I hope y\u00e2\u0080\u0099all find peace. Be well and be safe and try to enjoy life\u00e2\u0080\u0099s moments, because we never get those back.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nOutside the prison, more than 100 officers stood vigil. And a motorcycle club that supports police revved their engines, with the roar from the bikes audible in the chamber.\n\nJennings was pronounced dead at 6:33 p.m., 18 minutes after the drug started. He became the first inmate put to death this year both in the U.S. and in Texas, the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s busiest capital punishment state.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cJustice has been rendered and my family can finally have the closure we deserve,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Michael Agee, Howard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s nephew and a current Houston officer, said after watching Jennings die.\n\nHouston Police Chief Art Acevedo, asked about the 30-plus years between the crime and the punishment, said he thought \u00e2\u0080\u009cjustice delayed is, to an extent, an injustice continued.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBut when the state takes a life, there has to be a process,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Acevedo said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIn this case, the day of reckoning is here. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a solemn occasion. For us it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a celebration of a life well-lived by Officer Howard. We\u00e2\u0080\u0099re a family. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s why we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re here.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nHis attorneys had asked the U.S. Supreme Court to delay his execution, arguing Jennings\u00e2\u0080\u0099 trial attorneys failed to ask jurors to fully consider evidence \u00e2\u0080\u0094 including details of his remorse for the officer\u00e2\u0080\u0099s shooting and possible brain damage \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that might have spared him a death sentence.\n\nJennings had received an execution stay in 2016. But the high court and lower appeals courts rejected his request to delay Wednesday\u00e2\u0080\u0099s execution and the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles turned down Jennings\u00e2\u0080\u0099 request to commute his sentence.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA twice convicted robber, Jennings had been on parole for about two months when prosecutors say he entered Mr. Peeper\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Bookstore with the intention of robbing the business. Since being paroled, Jennings had gone on a crime spree, committing about 10 robberies, including having already robbed the same adult bookstore 12 days before Howard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s slaying.\n\nOfficer Howard, 24, was in the middle of arresting the store clerk for operating a pornographic video arcade without a permit when Jennings shot the officer twice in the head.\n\nHoward, who had been wearing a jacket with the words \u00e2\u0080\u009cHouston Police\u00e2\u0080\u009d on it, staggered for a few feet before falling to the ground, where he was shot twice more by Jennings. The clerk later testified the shooting was so quick, Howard never had a chance to unholster his gun.\n\nJennings was arrested hours later when he went to a Houston hospital after being shot in the hand by his accomplice, who got angry at Jennings for shooting the officer.\n\nJoe Gamaldi, the president of the Houston Police Officers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Union, said Jennings has spent more time on death row than Howard was alive.\n\nHoward \u00e2\u0080\u009cwas an honorable man full of integrity who did his job. He was absolutely one of the best and he was just taken entirely too soon by this animal who murdered him in cold blood,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gamaldi said.\n\nAfter his arrest, Jennings confessed to killing Howard, telling police in a tape-recorded statement he was remorseful about what happened and would \u00e2\u0080\u009cface whatever punishment (he had) coming.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nEdward Mallett, one of Jennings\u00e2\u0080\u0099 current appellate attorneys, said the inmate\u00e2\u0080\u0099s trial attorneys failed to present sufficient evidence of his remorse as well as his history of brain damage, being abused as a child and drug addiction. He said the trial attorneys also failed to provide an instruction to jurors that would have allowed them to give sufficient weight to these aspects of Jennings\u00e2\u0080\u0099 life when they deliberated.\n\nMallett said a prior appellate attorney also failed to argue these issues in earlier appeals.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThere has not been an adequate presentation of his circumstances including mental illness and mental limitations,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Mallett said.\n\nJennings\u00e2\u0080\u0099 trial in 1989 took place just as the Supreme Court issued a ruling that faulted Texas\u00e2\u0080\u0099 capital sentencing statute for not allowing jurors to consider evidence supporting a sentence less than death.\n\nThe Texas Legislature changed the statute to address the high court\u00e2\u0080\u0099s concerns but that took place after Jennings was convicted.\n\nThe Texas Attorney General\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Office called Jennings\u00e2\u0080\u0099 claim he had ineffective lawyers at his trial and during earlier appeals \u00e2\u0080\u009cspecious,\u00e2\u0080\u009d and said appeals courts have previously rejected allegations his personal history was not adequately investigated and presented at his trial.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy hope is that on Wednesday (Howard\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family gets) the closure that they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been searching for 30 years,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Gamaldi said.\n\n___\n\nLozano reported from Houston.\n\n___\n\nFollow Juan A.

Hilton, bum ankle and all, couldn't hold back his sly grin when talking about their playoff opponent this weekend.\n\n\"I'm going to my second home,\" Hilton said.\n\nHilton wasn't talking about playing in Indianapolis or in his hometown in Miami. He was referring to NRG Stadium in Houston.\n\nThe Colts, back in the playoffs for the first time since 2014, will play the Texans at NRG Stadium in a Wild Card playoff matchup Saturday (4:35 p.m., ESPN).\n\nThat stadium has legitimately been like a second home field for Hilton throughout his seven-year NFL career. He has 41 receptions for 932 yards and seven touchdowns in seven games played in Houston. In Hilton's last game in Houston -- Dec. 9 -- he had nine catches for 199 yards, including a 60-yard pass to get the Colts going in the second quarter.\n\nBest of NFL Nation \u00e2\u0080\u00a2 NFL ultimate all-conference teams: ACC, SEC\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 How to watch MNF Classics: SEA-SF\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Is 49ers rookie Aiyuk another Sanders?\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 How Colts keep virtual program fresh\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u00a2 Stefanski's early impression on Browns\n\n\"I don't know what it is, I just like playing in that stadium and now I get another chance at it,\" Hilton said Sunday after the Colts' 33-17 win against the Tennessee Titans to clinch the final playoff spot in the AFC.\n\nHow effective Hilton will be against the Texans is anybody's guess. It was on that 60-yard reception that Hilton first injured his ankle more than three weeks ago. He hasn't been healthy since, and likely won't be until at some point after the season. But he has played in every game since, missing only practice time to help try to ease the workload on his ankle.\n\nTo add to Hilton's ankle problems, he'll have one less day to rest it because the game will be played Saturday instead of Sunday this week.\n\n\"Every day of rest helps, so not having that is probably a small factor,\" Colts coach Frank Reich said.\n\nHilton said he aggravated his ankle on his first reception in Sunday's game against the Titans. He tried to turn quickly back toward the middle of the field before being tackled on his 18-yard gain.\n\n\"I'll be alright,\" Hilton said. \"Short week, I don't have a choice, I'll be ready.\"\n\nHilton noticeably limped to the sideline after that play and missed a couple of snaps before returning to the game.\n\nT.Y. Hilton has been making big plays for the Colts, but he finished with just two catches in the season finale Sunday in Tennessee. Photo by Frederick Breedon/Getty Images\n\n\"I love T.Y. He's unbelievable,\" Reich said. \"In the game [Sunday] after he had that first reception and long gain. The next series he's sitting off over on the bench and I kind of look back over at him. I just want to make eye contact with him to see how he's doing. I look back and I just kind of give him a look of 'Thumbs up or a thumbs down -- are you good, are you going?' He just looks at me with a smile and nods his head like he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going.\"\n\nHilton finished with just two catches, his second lowest of the season, but he proved once again -- as he said earlier this season -- that his less than 100 percent is better than a lot of other receivers' 100 percent when he took a bubble screen and picked up 43 yards while basically running on one leg.\n\nToughing it out is the way Hilton will have to continue to play. His presence on the field causes defenses -- especially Houston's -- to respect the side of the field that he's on.\n\n\"It just gives me a comfort,\" Reich said. \"Having him out there -- and I know he's not full speed. He's far from it. Who knows what percent he is, but I just know he's fighting for every rep and every catch he can make.\"", "title": "Colts' T.Y.

Mandatory Credit: Brett Davis-USA TODAY Sports\n\nAnd after two sleeps at the J.W. Marriott in Atlanta, the 41-year-old quarterback loves what he sees from the New England Patriots.\n\nIt started Monday night, when tight end Rob Gronkowski broke into spontaneous dance moves during Opening Night introductions at State Farm Arena.\n\nBrady said Gronkowski\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gyrations should give everyone associated with the Patriots \u00e2\u0080\u009ca good feeling.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI was standing right next to him and he was having a good time, which tells me a lot of good things,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Brady said of Gronkowski, who was not available to media Tuesday afternoon. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt means he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s feeling good, and he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s excited. I think we should all be happy about that.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe next sign Brady needs to see: execution at practice. The Patriots will be on the field Wednesday at Georgia Tech University.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHaving a good practice gives you confidence \u00e2\u0080\u0094 all of those things are going come up on Sunday,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\nBrady is well-practiced when it comes to the Super Bowl. While the Patriots are playing for a Lombardi Trophy for the third consecutive season, the experience is still novel for a handful of players on the roster. Brady is sharing his advice in-house.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a long game, a lot of timeouts, a lot of breaks,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Brady said, adding he will encourage players to spend Saturday searching out rest and reminding families on hand the one remaining day of the season is by far the most critical.\n\nFor Brady, weekend distractions are not an issue.\n\nHis family will arrive Thursday, when the Patriots host a family meal and help players set priorities for the two remaining days of preparation: a Friday practice and Saturday walkthrough.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI know what I need to prioritize,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Brady said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cNothing really gets in the way of that. I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not really going out at night.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPatriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels said the reason Brady is still playing at a high level is no one expects more from Brady than Brady himself. Practice and game day are not dramatically different in terms of Brady\u00e2\u0080\u0099s level of intensity.\n\nWhen asked to identify the best things about the season the Patriots will close the book on this week, Brady didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t discuss the dramatic overtime win at Kansas City or any other victory.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was nice this season with no injuries to be a full-go at practice,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\nMcDaniels was willing to point out Brady is one of the best \u00e2\u0080\u009cin the history of the game\u00e2\u0080\u009d at getting rid of the ball quickly. Brady said he will be mindful of getting the ball out of his hand Sunday against likely NFL Defensive Player of the Year Aaron Donald and his sidekick at defensive tackle, Ndamukong Suh.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is a really unique defense,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Brady said, with a wry grin. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s going to take our best game.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPatriots fans are beyond looking for positive signs in Brady. His 5-3 record in the Super Bowl includes wins in 2002, 2004, 2005, 2015 and 2017. The losses, to the New York Giants (twice) and last year against the Philadelphia Eagles, provide \u00e2\u0080\u009cmental scar tissue,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the type of endemic Brady uses as fuel.\n\nBut if New England fans needed a morsel of optimism on Tuesday, it could be found in a wide-open and relaxed Brady sharing stories about snapping a golf club, punching a hole in the wall and smashing a video game controller in what turned into a spontaneous Ask Me Anything style session with a couple hundred members of the media and cameramen.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMust be a big game,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said to start the festivities.\n\nHowever, Brady, trained under tight-lipped head coach Bill Belichick, wanted no part of the \u00e2\u0080\u009cGOAT\u00e2\u0080\u009d questions again Tuesday.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFootball is a team sport,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\nEven so, a win over the Rams would put New England, Brady and Belichick on a plane all their own, peerless and unparalleled by the most legendary winners in the sport.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cHe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a great quarterback,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Belichick said of Brady. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099d certainly put him up there against anybody. I don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t think it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my job to rate anyone. His record is unmatched and I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m glad that he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s my quarterback.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u0094By Jeff Reynolds, Field Level Media", "title": "Brady sees great early signs from Patriots in Atlanta", "dataset": "auto_google", "labels": "['sport_news']", "annot_city": "[]"}, {"id": 4572, "city": "Atlanta", "url": "https://www.ajc.com/business/hartsfield-jackson-security-lines-more-than-hour-long-amid-shutdown/n55XXPeW5zCTRLmiJU5t7I/", "text": "Security lines at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport stretched more than an hour long Monday morning, causing travelers to miss flights amid the partial federal shutdown.\n\nPhoto: Kelly Yamanouchi / AJC\n\nAt a time when the world\u00e2\u0080\u0099s busiest airport has its biggest crowds, there were at least six security lanes closed at domestic terminal security checkpoints, while passengers waited in lines that stretched through the terminal and were winding through baggage claim.\n\nPhoto: Kelly Yamanouchi / AJC\n\nWait times could reach as long as an hour and a half.\n\nThe long lines signaled staffing shortages at security checkpoints, as TSA officers have been working without pay since the federal shutdown began Dec. 22.\n\nPhoto: Kelly Yamanouchi / AJC\n\nAirport officials normally advise travelers to get to the airport two hours before domestic flights, but on Monday morning Hartsfield-Jackson spokesman Andrew Gobeil advised that travelers should consult with their airlines.

(1:20)\n\nFans coming to see the Los Angeles Rams face the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LIII will pay thousands for game tickets, but at least they can fill up on $2 hot dogs and some $5 beers once inside Atlanta's Mercedes-Benz Stadium.\n\nAtlanta Falcons president and CEO Rich McKay reiterated the stadium would have its \"Fan First Menu Pricing'' for the 75,000 spectators expected to attend the Super Bowl on Feb. 3. Just like at a Falcons game at the Mercedes-Benz Stadium, concessions will feature 12 popular food and beverage items -- including $5 cheeseburgers, $3 nachos with cheese, and $2 refillable soft drinks -- at lower prices than any other major professional American sports venue, plus without tax for easier concession-stand transactions.\n\nA glance at last year's Super Bowl at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis shows a hot dog is $4 less expensive at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, and beer is $1.10 less per 20 ounces.\n\nIncreasing the prices based on the magnitude of the Super Bowl was never an option, McKay said.\n\n\"We said this in our negotiations with the SEC, the college football championship, the Super Bowl, and the Final Four ... what we basically said is every customer that comes through that door is our customer,'' McKay said in a phone interview. \"So we want to treat all those customers the same and give them the same experience in food and beverage.\n\n\"What was interesting with the SEC negotiations, [late] commissioner Michael Slive kept telling me, 'Hey, I want a provision in this contract that talks about the pricing and prohibits you from being able to raise the prices for our game.' And I said, 'Commissioner, we want the same provision.' It was interesting that we had a common goal yet two different mindsets. So we put that in the bids for all the major events, including the World Cup.' ''\n\nAtlanta Falcons\n\nOfficials introduced the \"Fan First Menu Pricing\" when the $1.5 billion Mercedes-Benz Stadium opened in August 2017. It was a vision brought forth by billionaire Falcons owner Arthur Blank, a vision resulting in immediate success in the eyes of stadium executives. McKay said that from the last year of the Georgia Dome through the first year at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, the spending per customer went up 16 percent despite the 55 percent drop in prices.\n\n\"So that just shows you the amount of volume that took place,'' McKay said.\n\nA meeting took place two weeks ago with concessionaire Levy to make the final preparations for the Super Bowl. One last-minute alteration was to add another walk-in cooler. There are 12 walk-in food coolers and 29 for keg storage. Fans will have more time to spend, so the stadium can't afford to run out of items. To illustrate, the stadium will have 75,000 bottled waters and 55,000 hot dogs stocked for the Super Bowl.\n\n\"Traditionally, we open the door two hours before, but for this, we'll open four hours before,'' McKay said. \"So there's no question, from a food standpoint on hot dogs, chicken tenders, whatever it may be, we're going to be well-stocked, because we know that we're going to face a high-volume event just, for no other reason, the amount of time it's going to be open.''\n\nAs for any congestion at concession stands, McKay is confident the 680 points of sale that include at least one of the items from the fan-first menu will alleviate any issues.\n\n\"It does you no good to charge $2 for a hot dog if it takes an hour to get it,'' McKay said.\n\nMcKay said it's like comparing \"apples to oranges'' in trying to break down how every single item sizes up with other stadiums. Compared with Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida -- the site of next year's Super Bowl -- a hot dog at Mercedes-Benz Stadium is $4.75 less, and beer is $2.80 less per 20 ounces.\n\nMcKay was hopeful that other franchises would introduce the lower-priced model, and they slowly have. Thirteen professional and college sports teams followed the Falcons/Mercedes-Benz Stadium lead in announcing the lowering of concession prices, including the Atlanta Hawks, Baltimore Ravens and Detroit Lions.\n\n\"The one in the NFL that really adopted a program similar to ours is the Baltimore Ravens,'' McKay said. \"And what we like is at the end of the year, in the NFL fan ratings, we finished No. 1 in all food-and-beverage categories. And from how I understand it, the Baltimore Ravens are now No. 2 in many of those categories.\n\n\"What I like about it is [the Super Bowl] gives us a chance to further tell the story nationwide. We still have people that come to our venue for their first event, and they're surprised by it. You're going to have a lot of fans coming from all different parts of the country, whether it's the two teams' fan base or it's just fans that are coming to a Super Bowl. We like the fact that No. 1, they're going to have a great experience, and No. 2, they're going to take the story back and continue to push the story.''\n\nMore NFL franchises certainly seem open to following the Falcons/Mercedes-Benz Stadium lead.\n\n\"Everybody has to study what the Falcons did,'' Kevin Demoff, CEO and executive vice president of the Rams, told ESPN. \"I think it goes beyond just cutting the prices. It's how they managed to increase volume, increase service. Their fans responded. You do the homework not only on the prices but the quality and the speed of service and the lines.\n\n\"It's a great credit to the organization and everything they did around the concession program, the hospitality, the game-day experience. The concession piece is important. And clearly, the headlining element is the prices. But nobody would be talking about the prices if the food wasn't good and the service wasn't good.''", "title": "Beer, hot dog prices to stay low for Atlanta Super Bowl", "dataset": "auto_google", "labels": "['sport_news']", "annot_city": "[]"}, {"id": 4576, "city": "Atlanta", "url": "https://www.ajc.com/sports/how-much-money-might-atlanta-united-make-from-selling-almiron/u0DCZyuC8NF3d238H6D3NP/", "text": "How much money will Atlanta United receive once the sale of Miguel Almiron to Newcastle is complete?\n\nThe agreed-upon transfer fee hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been revealed.\n\nFor the purposes of this exercise, let\u00e2\u0080\u0099s split the difference between the $30 million that was Atlanta United\u00e2\u0080\u0099s valuation and the $20 million Newcastle reportedly offered.\n\nSo, $25 million.\n\nAccording to MLS rules:\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cA club shall receive three quarters (3/4) of the corresponding transfer or loan fee revenue (including agent fees and other expenses), from any transaction involving a player that is NOT a Homegrown Player, Generation adidas Player, or player acquired via the MLS SuperDraft.\n\nIf a Designated Player is transferred or loaned, the club will receive all amounts of the transfer or loan fee revenue until it has recouped all out-of-pocket cash payments made by the club in connection to that player prior to any sharing arrangement with the League. After such recoup, the transfer or loan of the Designated Player shall be treated as any other transfer with the club receiving three quarters (3/4) of the corresponding transfer or loan fee revenue.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo, Atlanta United reportedly paid $9 million to acquire Almiron from Lanus from Argentina in 2017. The team would recoup that cost.\n\nIt would also recoup the cost of Almiron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s salary in 2017 and 2018. That is roughly $4.6 million.\n\nThe transfer fee and Almiron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s salary together are $13.6 million.\n\nThe difference between $25 million and $13.6 million is $11.4 million. Atlanta United would receive 75 percent, or $8.55 million, of that total. The team must also take off Almiron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s salary cap charge for past two years, which is around $750,000.\n\nSo, if Atlanta United sells Almiron for $25 million, it will receive approximately $21.4 million.\n\nThere are other fees and things associated with the acquisition and sale that aren\u00e2\u0080\u0099t included, so that $21.4 million could change, but it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a solid approximation.\n\nSupport real journalism.

He hasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t worked as a quarterback since 2017. And there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a pending National Football League Players Association lawsuit against the league, alleging that team owners, influenced by President Donald Trump, conspired against him.\n\nIn May, the NFL announced that teams would be fined if all of their players did not stand for the national anthem, although it did suggest that players could stay in the locker room. But the league later abandoned the policy so they could negotiate terms with the NFLPA.\n\nOnly a handful of players, including Carolina Panther Eric Reid and Miami Dolphins wide receivers Kenny Stills and Albert Wilson, knelt during the national anthem during games this season.\n\nNFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, at his annual State of the NFL Address, touched vaguely and briefly on Kaepernick.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cOur clubs make decisions about players they want on their rosters,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Goodell said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf a team decides that (Kaepernick) or any other player can help their team win, that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what they\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll do.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAt other times during his 45 minutes fielding questions, the commissioner referred to Atlanta as \u00e2\u0080\u009ca city of milestones, a city of progress\u00e2\u0080\u009d and \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe pillar of the civil rights movement.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nUsing the grand spectacle of the Super Bowl as a backdrop, several organizations have have seized on that Atlanta history and plan some form of protest in the days leading up to the game.\n\nIt is not a new concept.\n\nLast year, 17 activists protesting police brutality were arrested outside of U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis after blocking a light-rail line carrying Super Bowl ticket holders.\n\nIn 2000, the last year Atlanta hosted a Super Bowl, more than 100 protesters, led by the Rev. Joseph Lowery and the Rev. Jesse Jackson, protested Georgia\u00e2\u0080\u0099s continued use of Confederate symbols on the state flag. A similar rally, against Confederate monuments, is planned for Saturday at Piedmont Park to take advantage of the publicity that will come with the Super Bowl in Atlanta.\n\nGerald Griggs, an Atlanta attorney and board member for the Georgia Alliance for Social Justice, said the NFL has responded poorly when given the chance to weigh in on social ills. The treatment of black men by police is one example, he said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe very issue that Colin Kaepernick was highlighting is continuing to be ignored by the NFL and ultimately by the person they have chosen to align themselves with,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Griggs said.\n\nThat person is President Trump, he said. During the 2017 season, Trump excoriated NFL players for taking a knee during the national anthem.\n\nActivists and lawsuits have accused NFL owners of kneeling to President Trump in how they deal with player protests.

Atchison was allegedly fleeing police and federal authorities who sought to arrest him on an armed robbery warrant. Griggs said Atchison\u00e2\u0080\u0099s family, who say Atchison was unarmed and hiding in a closet when he was shot, will be at the rally.\n\nJamal H. Bryant, senior pastor of New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Stonecrest, has been boycotting the Super Bowl since Kaepernick took a knee and once led about 300 men to take a knee outside of M&T Bank Stadium in Baltimore.\n\nAnd he\u00e2\u0080\u0099s not changing his mind this year when the Super Bowl is held in his new town of Atlanta.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBlack people in America have been played too often and too much,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cAmerica was upset when Colin Kaepernick took a knee but became deathly quiet when 800,000 people didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t get a check during the furlough.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nBryant said he plans to address the issue with a \u00e2\u0080\u009cSoup & Souls Sunday Worship Service,\u00e2\u0080\u009d followed by a Super Bowl party for the homeless community, with food and ministry.\n\nAs they prepare to perform at halftime, Maroon 5, Travis Scott and Atlanta\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Big Boi have faced withering scrutiny over their decisions to play. More than 111,000 people have signed a change.org petition, urging them to drop out of the event. Meanwhile, superstars like Rihanna and Cardi B. publicly refused invitations to perform in support of Kaepernick.\n\nFormer Georgia Gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams (second from left) was joined by Grammy Award-winning rapper Common (right of Abrams), Attorney Glenda Hatchet (left) and supporters as during a Souls to the Polls rally and march in downtown Atlanta on October 28, 2018.

Kapoor, a onetime billionaire and founder of Arizona-based Insys Therapeutics, is scheduled to go on trial in US District Court in Boston along with four former company executives on charges that they acted more like mobsters than pharmaceutical executives when they sold a brand of fentanyl, a powerful and addictive opioid.\n\nThe federal government, which has been accused of failing to hold drug companies to account for the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deadly opioid epidemic, hopes to dispel that impression Monday when the first criminal trial of pharmaceutical executives who marketed a painkiller begins.\n\nInsys Therapeutics founder John Kapoor faces up to 20 years in prison if convicted of racketeering conspiracy.\n\nIn a trial expected to last up to three months, federal prosecutors will try to convince a jury that the five defendants paid bribes and kickbacks to physicians in a nationwide racketeering conspiracy. The payments allegedly induced doctors to prescribe Subsys, an under-the-tongue fentanyl spray approved to treat severe cancer-related pain, for patients who hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t been diagnosed with cancer.\n\nThe painkiller Subsys was approved for sale in 2012. Insys Therapeutics via New York Times\n\nThe case features several explosive allegations. Prosecutors say that Insys set up a sham \u00e2\u0080\u009cspeakers program\u00e2\u0080\u009d to funnel cash to doctors, adjusted payments based on how many prescriptions doctors wrote, misrepresented patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 medical histories to dupe insurers into covering Subsys for people without cancer, and even hired a woman who was a former stripper and escort service manager as a key sales executive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFormer Insys employees, in federal whistle-blower lawsuits filed around the country, have described a macho, high-pressure sales operation in which deception was encouraged.\n\nOne former executive allegedly told sales representatives that \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe Wolf of Wall Street,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the 2013 film about a corrupt stock broker, was \u00e2\u0080\u009cthe best sales training video in history,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to one suit.\n\nThe criminal case marks a rare instance of the government using the criminal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, to go after corporate executives. The statute was approved in 1970, chiefly to prosecute organized crime figures.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAny time criminal RICO is applied to something that would appear to be a legitimate business or enterprise, it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s always somewhat unusual,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Brad Bailey, a Boston criminal defense lawyer and former federal and state prosecutor who is not involved in the matter. In this instance, he said, the government wants to prove that Insys\u00e2\u0080\u0099s marketing of the painkiller was nothing less than a \u00e2\u0080\u009ctop-to-bottom fraudulent scheme.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nIn contrast, lawyers for the former Insys executives are expected to argue that the case is an egregious example of government overreach. In a recent court filing, defense attorneys wrote that the prosecutors have failed to satisfy legal requirements for bringing RICO charges and want to \u00e2\u0080\u009ctar and feather [the defendants] based on drug-dealing allegations at the height of the opioid crisis.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nInsys Therapeutics headquarters in Chandler, Ariz. Samantha Sais/New York Times\n\nProsecutors say the alleged scheme affected how some doctors prescribed Insys across the country, but the charges were brought by the US attorney\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office in Massachusetts, which for years has played a leading role nationally in prosecuting health care fraud.\n\nThe case certainly marks a shift in how the Justice Department has treated the makers of opioid-based drugs.\n\nPurdue Pharma, a privately held drug company in Stamford, Conn., has drawn far more criticism during the opioid epidemic, which federal officials say killed nearly 400,000 people from 1999 to 2017. But in comparison to the Insys prosecution, Purdue has been treated mildly by the government.\n\nOwned by the Sackler family, Purdue markets OxyContin, a time-release opioid painkiller that has dominated headlines in the crisis. Purdue launched the drug in 1996 and mounted an aggressive marketing campaign to primary-care doctors, presenting OxyContin as a safe treatment for backaches and joint pain.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn fact, OxyContin \u00e2\u0080\u0094 which reached blockbuster status in 2000 by achieving $1.1 billion in annual sales \u00e2\u0080\u0094 was highly addictive and easily abused. When patients could no longer renew prescriptions, many turned to heroin, which is cheaper and easier to acquire on the street.\n\nIn 2007, as fatal opioid overdoses surged across the country, Purdue admitted to a felony of lying about OxyContin\u00e2\u0080\u0099s potentials for abuse and addiction, and three current and former Purdue executives pleaded guilty in Virginia to a federal misdemeanor charge of misbranding.\n\nPurdue and the three men paid $634.5 million in fines. But no one went to jail.\n\nAs it turned out, federal prosecutors in Virginia had wanted to pursue charges that could have sent the executives to jail, according to a document made public last year. But the Justice Department balked after lobbying by lawyers on behalf of Purdue, including former New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who is now a lawyer for President Trump.\n\nTwelve years later, Kapoor and the other four Insys defendants face decidedly higher stakes. If convicted of racketeering conspiracy, they could be sentenced to up to 20 years in prison. That would satisfy some critics of drug companies that promoted opioids.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cFor corporations to be able to kill people in their pursuit of profit and simply pay a fine is not adequate,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Dr. Andrew Kolodny, codirector of opioid policy research at Brandeis University\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Heller School for Social Policy and Management. \u00e2\u0080\u009cOtherwise, it could be seen as the cost of doing business.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAlthough Kolodny welcomed the prosecution, he said Insys\u00e2\u0080\u0099s marketing tactics were not that different from those of Purdue and other makers of opioid-based painkillers.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cBeing made an example of \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s the point of deterrence,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\nKapoor is the most prominent of the five Insys defendants. A 75-year-old shaggy-haired entrepreneur who was raised in India, lives in Phoenix, and was \u00e2\u0080\u0094 until recently \u00e2\u0080\u0094 on Forbes magazine\u00e2\u0080\u0099s list of billionaires, Kapoor founded Chandler, Ariz.-based Insys in 1990. For more than a decade, he largely funded it out of his own pocket.\n\nHe guided Subsys to government approval \u00e2\u0080\u0094 motivated, he said, by seeing his wife, Editha, suffer before she died of metastatic breast cancer in 2005.\n\nSubsys was one of a handful of potent and highly regulated prescription fentanyl brands intended for cancer patients suffering from \u00e2\u0080\u009cbreakthrough pain\u00e2\u0080\u009d \u00e2\u0080\u0094 that is, pain not quelled by doses of other opioids. Fentanyl is up to 100 times stronger than morphine, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration.\n\nAfter Subsys was approved in 2012, Insys boomed. The company went public in 2013 and was the nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s best-performing IPO that year. By 2015, revenue from Subsys had approached $500 million.\n\nMuch of that, however, was the result of criminal acts, according to prosecutors. Kapoor and his fellow defendants allegedly identified doctors who might be receptive to prescribing large amounts of Subsys. They then paid them to write prescriptions for patients who didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have cancer but wanted pain relief, prosecutors say.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nInsys is accused of disguising payoffs as speaking fees for spreading the word about the drug\u00e2\u0080\u0099s benefits.\n\nInsys also allegedly paid the salaries of office staffers of doctors who prescribed Subsys. And the company set up an \u00e2\u0080\u009cInsys Reimbursement Center\u00e2\u0080\u009d in Arizona that allegedly misrepresented patients\u00e2\u0080\u0099 histories to fool insurers, including Medicare and Medicaid, into covering the cost of the painkiller, even though most patients didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have cancer, prosecutors say.\n\nThe four other defendants are Michael Gurry, the former vice president of managed markets; Sunrise Lee, a former regional director; Joseph Rowan, a former regional director; and Richard Simon, a former national director of sales.\n\nLee is a former Florida strip club dancer and onetime manager of an escort service who was hired as a sales executive despite having no academic degree, according to one of several whistle-blower lawsuits filed against Insys.\n\nAlec Burlakoff, a former Insys vice president who pleaded guilty to a count of racketeering conspiracy in November and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors, defended her hiring, according to one of the suits, saying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cDoctors really enjoyed spending time with her and found Sunrise to be a great listener.\u00e2\u0080\u009d He added, \u00e2\u0080\u009cShe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s more of a closer.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nEarlier this month, Michael Babich, the former CEO of Insys, pleaded guilty to a count of conspiracy and a count of mail fraud for his role in the alleged scheme. He has also agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.\n\nThe criminal investigation began after several former Insys employees filed whistle-blower lawsuits that alleged executives seemed indifferent to the harm Subsys posed to patients without cancer.\n\nOne former sales representative said she was told \u00e2\u0080\u009cthese patients would not get worse as a consequence of unnecessarily taking Subsys. . . . They were already addicts and their prospects were already rock-bottom,\u00e2\u0080\u009d according to a suit filed in a federal court in California.\n\nThat same representative, who filed her complaint anonymously, said she was told to \u00e2\u0080\u009cbehave more sexually\u00e2\u0080\u009d and stroke the hands of doctors while \u00e2\u0080\u009cliterally begging\u00e2\u0080\u009d them to prescribe more Subsys.\n\nDoctors who wrote prescriptions for Subsys are expected to testify at trial. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s unclear whether the jury will hear evidence of patients who overdosed or became addicted.\n\nSeveral physicians who received payoffs in exchange for writing Subsys prescriptions have been convicted elsewhere of federal charges. They include Dr. Jerrold Rosenberg, of North Providence, who pleaded guilty last year in federal court in Providence to creating false patient records and to taking more than $188,000 in kickbacks disguised as speaker fees. He was sentenced to more than four years in prison.\n\nInsys is still in business but is focusing on developing synthetic cannabinoids. The company has undergone a \u00e2\u0080\u009csignificant transformation\u00e2\u0080\u009d since a new management team arrived in 2017, said spokeswoman Jackie Marcus.\n\nA \u00e2\u0080\u009cmodestly sized team\u00e2\u0080\u009d still markets Subsys, she said.\n\nJonathan Saltzman can be reached at jsaltzman@globe.com.

However, Gina Schertzer, who\u00e2\u0080\u0099s been working at the restaurant for 43 years as a bartender and server, told Eater she hadn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t noticed a significant downturn in her tips.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI no longer have the speed the young people do, but I can still make $50 on a deuce,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThis is about greed.

John Durgin, Eldridge Park, and John G. Chandler purchased it in 1827, and in 1877, Chandler dubbed the business Durgin-Park in honor of his business partners, who had since died. The Chandler family continued to run the restaurant until 1945.\n\nSince then, it has passed through several hands. Up until the purchase by the Kelly family in the early 1970s, Durgin-Park had gotten a reputation for surly service; that aspect of the Durgin-Park tradition has been toned down a bit since the 1970s, but the restaurant still harks back to an earlier era of Boston dining with dishes like steamers (\u00e2\u0080\u009csometimes sandy,\u00e2\u0080\u009d warns the menu), a New England clambake, broiled scrod, prime rib, Yankee pot roast, lobster rolls, and \u00e2\u0080\u0094 of course \u00e2\u0080\u0094 chowder.\n\nRestaurant management cited a rise in minimum wage as a mitigating factor in the closure.

Last year was record-breaking for us in many ways and we couldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be more excited to enter the new year and continue to complete these important milestones ahead of us.\n\nThe first step the company is making to further its mission is the establishment of offices and infrastructure in the Oceania region including Australia and the Republic of Vanuatu. Further, this will include the recruitment of an expanded team of medical, clinical trial, agricultural and pharmaceutical personnel. I will be personally relocating to the region to spearhead the growth of Phoenix Life, and to be closer to our operations and clinical trial plans in The Republic of Vanuatu and throughout Oceania.\n\nWe believe that the many initiatives there will be expedited by expanding our offices and personnel in the region. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s important for us to build on the key relationships that we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been establishing with the people and government officials within the Pacific and further cementing Phoenix Life\u00e2\u0080\u0099s regional and global presence to assure successful long-term partnerships.\n\nSecondly, as announced at the end of last year, the approval for the importation of Phoenix Metabolic, our diabetes management product, has paved the way for the commencement of clinical trials in Vanuatu for the treatment and management of Type 2 diabetes. By expanding our presence in the region, we intend to expand access to these life and limb saving programs into region. According to the World Health Organization, the South Pacific contains more diabetics as a percentage of the population that any other area in the world, with limited or no access to treatment.\n\nFollowing the anticipated success of these international trials, Phoenix Life intends to be able to assemble all relevant study data to support new drug applications in developed nations such as the United States, Australia and areas of Europe starting in 2020.\n\nIn building out our Global Production Capacity, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099re very excited to confirm that we are in the final stages of completing documentation and policies to acquire land to commence propagation of regional plantations for cultivating, extraction and processing of range of cannabis varieties to provide the key active ingredients for Phoenix Life\u00e2\u0080\u0099s full product portfolio. We are looking forward to not only begin local growing and manufacturing but most importantly giving back to our partner countries by providing local employment, education, additional revenue streams, and most importantly positive health outcomes.\n\nOceania and the South Pacific is very important to the cannabis industry and to us because, according to New Frontier Data, the existing cannabis market across the region is worth an estimated $5.0 billion (U.S. dollars). The cannabis market in Australia alone is estimated to be worth up to $4.5 billion (U.S. dollars) as its medical cannabis market has taken the shape of a pharmaceutical market. This is in addition to Phoenix Life\u00e2\u0080\u0099s diabetes program. The tropical climate of this region and its close proximity to the equator makes it ideal for organic cannabis production because of the area\u00e2\u0080\u0099s abundance of natural sunlight and fresh spring water. These outdoor growing conditions significantly reduce the cost of infrastructure and operations, while making a year-round cultivation possible.\n\nLastly, as we launch our global sales organization, we are excited to bring some of the brightest minds in sales together with healthcare professionals to open up a series of country programs for clinical trials and product distribution. By including both generic medical cannabis products for doctor\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prescription as well as products designed to target and treat specific diseases like diabetes, cancer and pain, Phoenix Life has been positioned to start making a dramatic difference to the healthcare of patients in the Oceania region and globally.\n\nBuilding from the success of 2018, 2019 stands to be a watershed year for Phoenix Life. We look forward to sharing many more announcements this year so please stay tuned as our company continues to thrive and grow!\n\nWe look forward to you joining us this year as we help shape the future of healthcare.\n\nIn service of Global Healthcare,\n\nMartin Tindall\n\nChief Executive Officer\n\nPhoenix Life Sciences International Limited\n\nTo learn more about Phoenix Life Sciences International, please visit http://www.phoenixlife.co/\n\n\n\nAbout Phoenix Life Sciences International Limited\n\nPhoenix Life Sciences International Limited is an adaptive healthcare solutions company.

(Photo by Tyler Rittenhouse/Cronkite News)\n\nSCOTTSDALE \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Staging an event of any size that aims to reduce waste is a challenge. Organizing one of sport\u00e2\u0080\u0099s biggest spectator events while producing zero waste takes a whole different level of creativity.\n\nThe Waste Management Phoenix Open launched its Zero-Waste Challenge in 2012, and since 2013 the PGA Tour event at TPC Scottsdale\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Stadium Course has managed to divert 100 percent of all tournament waste away from landfills.\n\nInstead, tons of water bottles, paper plates, beer cans, food and other waste generated by the more than 700,000 fans who attend the PGA Tour event each year have been repurposed, recycled, composted, turned into energy or donated.\n\nThe effort has made the WMPO the largest zero-waste event in the world, according to the sponsoring Phoenix Thunderbirds and Waste Management, the waste collection and environmental management company in its 10th year as the tournament\u00e2\u0080\u0099s primary sponsor. Tournament and Waste Management officials announced this week that they have extended their agreement through 2030.\n\nHowever, as the tournament\u00e2\u0080\u0099s galleries, which already are the largest on the PGA Tour, continue to grow, so does the sustainability challenge. That\u00e2\u0080\u0099s where the creativity comes in.\n\nThis year, the tournament popped the cork on a new initiative that aims to repurpose the thousands of empty wine bottles left behind by golf fans throughout the tournament\u00e2\u0080\u0099s suites and hospitality areas.\n\nRefresh Glass, a Phoenix-based company that gathers empty wine bottles from hotels, restaurants and resorts and then recycles the glass to create home d\u00c3\u00a9cor items and glassware, is partnering with the tournament this year. Refresh Glass has a goal of repurposing 10 million wine bottles annually.\n\nWaste Management spokesman Rob Myers said Refresh Glass owner Ray DelMuro is arranging to gather empty wine bottles and broken glass from the tournament, transporting it to Refresh Glass and using it to make glassware and other items such as decorative candleholders.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cAfter that, he brings the items back to the tournament over the weekend to resell,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Myers said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really about closing that recycling loop.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPart of Waste Management\u00e2\u0080\u0099s goal at the golf tournament is to educate those who attend about the value of recycling and composting waste.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s what we do out here,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Janette Micelli, corporate communications director for Waste Management. \u00e2\u0080\u009cHow can we creatively tell the story, and then how can we have fun with it?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe tournament utilizes three Zero Waste Stations to provide the fun part.\n\nThe stations are repurposed trash dumpsters transformed into colorful kiosks, each with an interactive game that teaches attendees how to recycle and compost.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI learned that utensils are compostable,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Jennifer Villalobos, a golf spectator who visited a Zero Waste Station. \u00e2\u0080\u009cI would think that the plastic in them is recycled.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSo Villalobos, who is trying to live \u00e2\u0080\u009cgreen\u00e2\u0080\u009d wherever possible, learned something.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI like to have a bag where I put my recyclables, and a bag to put my trash in,\u00e2\u0080\u009d she said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThat\u00e2\u0080\u0099s something I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m always working on at home to make sure I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m helping the earth and giving back to the community.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cI\u00e2\u0080\u0099m learning new things, like maybe I shouldn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t put my utensils in the recycle bin anymore. And I think that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s kind of cool.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe Zero Waste Station closest to the tournament entrance includes an educational water feature, new this year, to teach fans the importance of conserving water. To set an example, the tournament collects and reuses all grey water from the event\u00e2\u0080\u0099s food stands and bars, directing it to portable toilets.\n\nThere are no \u00e2\u0080\u009ctrash\u00e2\u0080\u009d receptacles at the tournament. Instead, they are clearly labeled for recycling or composting, and there are plenty throughout the 18-hole layout.\n\nAlso, materials that are brought on site must be locally reused, recycled, or composted. Each vendor must sign a contract that requires them to use plates, napkins, and utensils that meet recycling requirements, reducing the amount of food-service waste.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe just hope people do the right thing, as you would anywhere,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Micelli said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe\u00e2\u0080\u0099re trying to inspire people to recycle more and to make sure their recycling is clean. You may not do zero waste at your home, but what can you do to think green?\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThe tournament\u00e2\u0080\u0099s efforts have not gone unnoticed. In 2017, the WMPO became the first tournament in the world certified by the Golf Environment Organization, and the tournament repeated the honor in 2018. Underwriters Laboratories verified the tournament\u00e2\u0080\u0099s zero-waste status.\n\nWhile achieving zero waste is the goal, there are some days during the tournament that are more challenging than others. Friday and Saturday crowds at the WMPO are renowned for their size and rowdiness. There\u00e2\u0080\u0099s only so much tournament staff and volunteers can do to limit litter. But with roughly nine waste receptacles within view from just about anywhere on the course, they are able to manage.\n\nLee Spivak, senior associate of Waste Management sustainability services, said the ultimate goal is to encourage and educate those who attend the tournament to make an environmental difference in their day-to-day lives.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really great to do what we can here, but then everyone leaves here and goes back to their homes and businesses,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Spivak said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cIf we can affect change in that sense, it really takes the event and grows the impact in a positive way.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nSpivak believes that with creativity and education, fans will buy in.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIf you piss everyone off, they\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to change,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThey\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to want to be involved. They\u00e2\u0080\u0099re not going to want to try to help you. So over the years, we\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve been trying to build up a culture shift, a foundation of what the norm is at this tournament.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009c It doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t work as well when you try to force it.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nThis story is part of Elemental: Covering Sustainability, a multimedia collaboration between Cronkite News, Arizona PBS, KJZZ, KPCC, Rocky Mountain PBS and PBS SoCal.\n\nSubscribe to Cronkite News on YouTube.", "title": "Waste-Managment Phoenix Open Remains Greenest Show on Turf", "dataset": "auto_google", "labels": "['waste']", "annot_city": "['Phoenix']"}, {"id": 4592, "city": "Phoenix", "url": "https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2817794-wwe-nxt-takeover-phoenix-results-winners-grades-reaction-and-highlights", "text": "5 of 5\n\nCredit: WWE.com\n\nTommaso Ciampa defeated Aleister Black under controversial methods to win the NXT Championship last summer.

Black's momentum came to a sudden halt when Ciampa delivered a nasty suplex that sent the challenger's knee crashing into the ring steps.\n\nCiampa worked the leg for several minutes, taunting his opponent by calling him a \"one-trick pony.\" He wrapped the leg around the ring post, in hopes of taking his kick-based arsenal away from him.\n\nThe champion was perched atop the ropes, looking to continue his onslaught, when Black caught him with a big kick from out of nowhere that sent both men tumbling to the arena floor. Commentator Mauro Ranallo put over Black's willingness to do himself damage in pursuit of the title.\n\nCiampa tried for his Fairy Tale Ending finish, but Black escaped and tried for Black Mass. Ciampa cut it off with a clothesline to the back of his head. Barely stunned, Black answered with a German suplex for two. Ciampa answered with a half crab, but Black fought out and applied one of his own.\n\nBlack lost sight of Ciampa at one point, and the champion made him pay with a Tower of London on the ring apron that netted him a two-count.\n\nAn exchange of strikes unfolded, each man staggering the other with his own punch- and kick-based offense. Ciampa tried to kick the leg out from underneath his opponent, but Black caught him with a double stomp. He answered moments later with a big moonsault to the arena floor. Black slipped on water spilled on the floor, and the momentary distraction allowed Ciampa to recover and deliver the Fairy Tale Ending for a very close two-count.\n\nLike Johnny Gargano earlier in the night, Ciampa pulled the mats up at ringside, exposing the concrete. A discussion between Ciampa and the referee allowed Black to seize an opening and deliver a double knee. Back inside, Black delivered Black Mass from out of nowhere, but an alert champion rolled onto his stomach to prevent the pin.\n\nCiampa delivered a DDT and a second Fairy Tale Ending, which Black kicked out of for the second time in the match. A third Fairy Tale Ending followed. Black escaped a fourth, but his knee gave out and he eventually succumbed to that fourth finisher as Ciampa successfully retained his title.\n\nAfter the match, as Ciampa made his way up the ramp, Gargano appeared and stood side-by-side with his partner-turned-enemy. He raised his newly won North American Championship high overhead, as did the retaining Ciampa. As the show faded to black, Gargano shot a glance at the NXT Championship, teasing that the issues between them may not be over.\n\nResult\n\nCiampa defeated Black\n\nGrade\n\nA\n\nAnalysis\n\nThis was completely different than everything else on the show. There were no big high spots; there was no high-flying offense that razzle-dazzled the crowd. This was a good, old-school, psychological wrestling match that told a strong story and gave Ciampa a wholly unexpected clean win to close out the broadcast.\n\nThe glare Gargano shot Ciampa at the end of the event was the most interesting part of the entire show in that it suggests their story is not over. Yes, the potential for an unholy alliance is there, but Gargano seemed to hint that, while he is happy to have his North American title, his eyes are on the NXT Championship and taking it away from the man who has made his life a living hell.\n\nGiven the quality of the story thus far, including an attention to detail unheard of from the company, it should be a damn fun ride.", "title": "WWE NXT TakeOver Phoenix Results Winners, Grades, Reaction and Highlights", "dataset": "auto_google", "labels": "['sport_news']", "annot_city": "[]"}, {"id": 4593, "city": "Phoenix", "url": "https://www.sportskeeda.com/basketball/nba-2018-19-phoenix-suns-vs-philadelphia-76ers-preview-and-prediction", "text": "We apologize for the inconvenience...\n\n...but your activity and behavior on this site made us think that you are a bot.\n\nNote: A number of things could be going on here.", "title": "ShieldSquare Captcha", "dataset": "auto_google", "labels": "['spam']", "annot_city": "[]"}, {"id": 4594, "city": "Phoenix", "url": "https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/phoenix/2019/01/23/phoenix-council-approves-230-million-suns-arena-renovation-deal/2648687002/", "text": "Phoenix City Council approves $230 million Phoenix Suns arena-renovation deal\n\nThe Phoenix City Council approved a controversial deal with the Phoenix Suns that will keep the NBA franchise in downtown Phoenix through at least 2037.\n\nThe council voted 6-2, with Vice Mayor Jim Waring and Councilman Sal DiCiccio opposing it, to approve the $230 million deal. The city will pay $150 million from its Sports Facilities Fund, which is composed of a 1 percent tax on hotels and a 2 percent tax on car rentals.\n\nThe council added a number of tweaks to the deal, including:\n\nRequiring the Suns to spend $10 million on community benefits (either through nonprofits or city programs), including at least $2.6 million to the city's preschool program this year.\n\nThe city will hire someone to oversee Phoenix's expenditures on the renovations.\n\nThe city will commit the $1.5 million rent increase from the Suns to homeless issues.\n\n80 percent of any additional revenues generated by the city from the arena will go toward city public-safety costs.\n\nDetails of the deal were released to the public in December \u00e2\u0080\u0094 less than a week before the council was initially supposed to vote on it. After public backlash, the council postponed the vote and hosted a series of public meetings to educate residents about the details of the agreement.\n\nAbout a month ago, interim Councilwoman Vania Guevara came out against the arena deal. She said during Wednesday's meeting that she changed her mind after working with the Suns to ensure they would increase their investment in the community, notably in the city's Head Start preschool program.\n\nWithout the money, city staff had warned, the program would have to decrease the number of students it served because the city needed to raise salaries for teachers in the program to keep up with state Legislature-approved teacher raises.\n\nAfter the vote, Suns owner Robert Sarver, who has faced criticism from fans, said he was glad he could demonstrate the team's commitment to the community through the donation.\n\nHe also said he believes the arena investment will be a \"win-win\" for both the team and Phoenix.\n\n\"I'm glad that we can carry on the vision that (former owner Jerry Colangelo) had and that this council had 26 years ago to get this building built,\" Sarver said.\n\nWhat is the deal?\n\nPhoenix pays $150 million for arena renovations.\n\nSuns pay $80 million for renovations and any cost overruns.\n\nAfter the renovation, Phoenix will pay $2 million annually for 12 \u00c2\u00bd years into a new renewal and replacement fund, which will be used for future renovation needs.\n\nSuns will pay $1 million into the new fund for 12 \u00c2\u00bd years.\n\nSuns will continue to operate and maintain the building, including booking concerts and other events.\n\nSuns will continue to pay rent to the city (calculated as a percentage of annual proceeds).\n\nSuns will build a new practice facility (estimated to cost $25 million to $50 million) somewhere in Phoenix.\n\nSuns commit to staying in downtown through 2037 with an option to extend the lease to 2042. If the team leaves before 2037, it will face up to a $200 million fine.\n\nCriticism of the deal\n\nThe council chambers were packed with residents eager to weigh in on the deal. The council allowed more than 30 people to comment before voting.\n\nMost of the speakers, ranging from business leaders to nonprofit directors, favored the deal and spoke heartily about the Suns' community commitment.\n\nBut the deal was not without its critics.\n\nSeveral individuals chided the deal as lopsided, since Phoenix will pay nearly double what the team will invest.\n\nThe internet's favorite critic, 90-year-old Greta Rogers, told the council that she had no disaffection for the Suns, but she was dismayed by the way the city negotiated the deal.\n\nShe lambasted the city for not including the public in conversations until it was too late. She also scoffed at the notion that the not-even-30-year-old building is obsolete.\n\n\"I'm three times that old and my facility's doing pretty well,\" Rogers said.\n\nMary Rose Wilcox shooter appears\n\nThe meeting took a bizarre turn when former Councilwoman and Maricopa County Supervisor Mary Rose Wilcox testified in favor of the renovations.\n\nShe had voted in favor of the original deals for both the Suns arena and Chase Field, where the Arizona Diamondbacks play. The latter vote resulted in a man shooting and wounding her in 1997 and claiming it was justified because of her support of sports subsidies.\n\nAbout five minutes after she spoke, Larry Naman, the man who shot Wilcox and served time in prison for the offense, approached the council, admitted to shooting Wilcox, and then insisted that the council put the Suns deal up for a public vote.\n\nHe said not allowing the public to vote on the matter was the equivalent of an \"act of violence against the public.\"\n\nNaman was allowed to stay in the council chambers for the remainder of the meeting, but police officers were present. He told a 12 News reporter after the meeting that he's off parole and doesn't own a gun.\n\nREAD MORE:", "title": "Phoenix council approves 230 million Suns arena-renovation deal", "dataset": "auto_google", "labels": "['not_sure']", "annot_city": "[]"}, {"id": 4595, "city": "Seattle", "url": "https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/cowboys-vs-seahawks-final-score-takeaways-dallas-rides-ezekiel-elliott-to-wild-playoff-win-over-seattle/", "text": "There's a reason they call it the wild-card round, and the reason is because you get wildly entertaining games like the one played on Saturday night in Dallas.\n\nIn a game that wasn't decided until Dallas recovered an onside kick with 1:16 left to play, the Cowboys outlasted the Seahawks 24-22 for a win that will now be sending Jason Garrett's team to the divisional round next week against either the Saints or the Rams.\n\nTo pick up their first playoff win in four years, the Cowboys did what they they've done a lot of this season: They fed Ezekiel Elliott.\n\nElliott, who finished 2018 as the NFL's leading rusher with 1,434 yards, slowly wore down the Seahawks defense on a night where he carried the ball 26 times for 137 yards and a touchdown. Elliott tends to shine in the fourth quarter, and that's exactly what he did against Seattle.\n\nWith just 7:20 left to play and the Cowboys clinging to a 17-14 lead, Dallas needed to put together a time-consuming drive, and so they decided to feed Zeke. On an 11-play drive that ran 5:12 off the clock and essentially iced the game, Elliott carried the ball five times for 31 yards. The Seahawks could only watch as precious seconds ticked away after each one of Elliott's carries.\n\nElliott's performance on the drive set up Dak Prescott for a one-yard score that proved to be the game-winning touchdown.\n\nAlthough Elliott came up big on that fourth quarter drive, he did most of his damage in the first half, when he carried the ball 13 times for 91 yards. One of the biggest plays of the game came on a third-and-1 for the Cowboys with just 1:09 left to play until halftime. At the time, Dallas was trailing 6-3 and If they didn't convert the third down from their own 34-yard line, they would have had to punt the ball back to Seattle.\n\nNot only did Elliott get the one yard for the first down, but he also tacked on 43 more yards to set the Cowboys up at the Seahawks' 22-yard line.\n\nThe run was pivotal because it gave the Cowboys a chance to get a touchdown right before halftime. With just 24 seconds left to play in the second quarter, Prescott hit Michael Gallup for a score that put the Cowboys up 14-10 at the half.\n\nPrescott wasn't perfect in this game, but he did more than enough to keep the pressure off Elliott. Not to mention, the Cowboys quarterback came through when the team needed him the most. In a play that basically saved the win for the Cowboys, Prescott converted a third-and-14 by pulling off a miraculous 16-yard run with under 2:45 left to play in the game.\n\nOverall, Prescott rushed for 29 yards to go along with his 226-yard passing performance.\n\nIf the Cowboys win the Super Bowl, they might want to send a ring to Jon Gruden, and that's because most of Prescott's passing yardage went to former Raiders receiver Amari Cooper. Cooper continued to come up big for the Cowboys and this time, he did it with a seven-catch, 106-yard performance that included the 34-yard reception you can see below.\n\nThat catch, which came in the fourth quarter, set up a one-yard touchdown run by Elliott that gave the Cowboys the lead for good at 17-14.\n\nThe Cowboys' new version of the triplets seems to be catching fire at the right time, and there's no reason to think that this team can't upset either the Saints or the Rams next week.\n\nDallas D puts clamps on Seahawks run game\n\nDuring the 2018 season, the Seahawks led the NFL in rushing with 160 yards per game, but they got nowhere close to that number in Dallas. Going up against a relentless Cowboys defense, the Seahawks were only able to muster 73 yards on 24 carries. The numbers are actually even uglier than that if you consider that 28 of those yards came on one carry, which means that Seattle gained just 45 yards on their 23 other rushes (1.96 yards per carry).\n\nSeahawks running back Chris Carson, who finished the season with 1,151 yards, had nowhere to run. At halftime, he had just 16 yards and he was only able to tack on four more in the second half. Cowboys linebacker Leighton Vander Esch, who's a strong Defensive Rookie of the Year candidate, was all over the field with 10 tackles. One key part of the Seahawks rushing attack is Russell Wilson, but he was mostly ineffective thanks to a perfectly designed defensive strategy from the Cowboys. For most of the game, the Cowboys had a shadow on Wilson to prevent the Seahawks quarterback from doing any damage with his legs, and the plan worked, because Wilson only rushed for 17 yards.\n\nSeahawks help stop the Seahawks\n\nAlthough the Cowboys deserve a lot of credit for shutting down the Seahawks offense, they also got some help from Seahawks offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer, who seemed lost calling plays. For the most part, the Seahawks spent the game running on first and second down, then hoping that Russell Wilson could bail them out on third down.\n\nThe problem for the Seahawks is that kind of offensive strategy just doesn't work when you're playing a defense as good as the Cowboys. Although Wilson had an impressive night (18 of 27, 233 yards, one touchdown), none of his magic was working on third down with the Seahawks going just 2 of 13 on third down conversions.\n\nSchottenheimer's obsession with sticking with something that wasn't working (the run game) didn't make any sense, and that's mostly because Wilson came up huge when he was actually allowed to throw. For instance, the Seahawks quarterback single-handedly kept his team in the game when he converted a fourth-and-6 in the third quarter with this perfect throw to Doug Baldwin.\n\nThe crazy thing is that Wilson was making throws like that all game. The Seahawks quarterback would put the ball where only his receiver could get it, and then his receiver would make a huge play. Here's a look at a 25-yard pass that Tyler Lockett caught in the second quarter.\n\nSchottenheimer's desire to stay with a run game that absolutely wasn't working turned the Seahawks into a one-dimensional team that the Cowboys easily shut down. Lockett, who caught four passes for 120 yards, was one of the few bright spots for the Seahawks offense.\n\nHome-field advantage is alive and well at Jerry World\n\nAlthough Seattle is known as a tough place to play, it's the Cowboys that have actually had one of the best home-field advantages in the NFL this year. Dallas finished the regular season with a 7-1 record at Jerry World, which was tied for the best home record in the NFC. The Cowboys asked their fans to wear white on Saturday to match the team's white uniforms, and let's just say, the fans in Dallas came through.\n\nEveryone loves to joke about Cowboys fans being bandwagon jumpers, but the fact of the matter is that this fan base has stood by the organization for nearly 25 years even though the Cowboys haven't come anywhere close to sniffing a Super Bowl since 1995. You could tell the fans in Dallas were eager to see the win on Saturday, and they came out in full force to AT&T Stadium to give the Cowboys a true home-field advantage against the Seahawks.\n\nThe Cowboys could actually end up hosting one more game this postseason, but that would only happen if they end up playing the Eagles, which means the Cowboys would need Philadelphia to somehow put together another magical playoff run. If the Eagles and Cowboys meet in the NFC Championship, the game would be played in Dallas on Jan. 20.\n\nAllen Hurns carted off after gruesome injury\n\nThe Cowboys lost Allen Hurns for the night after he suffered an ugly injury midway through the first quarter. The injury happened after Hurns caught a big 14-yard pass on a third-and-7 play for the Cowboys. As Hurns was fighting to get a few more yards, he got hit by Seahawks safety Bradley McDougald, who came down on the receiver's left ankle. In what can only be described as one of the most gruesome injuries you'll ever see, McDougald's body weight snapped Hurns' ankle. The game had to be stopped for nearly 10 minutes so trainers could take care of Hurns and get him carted off the field.\n\nThe good news is that Hurns was able to give a thumbs up before he was taken off the field.\n\nCowboys WR Allen Hurns gives a thumbs up to the crowd after suffering a gruesome ankle injury. pic.twitter.com/Q91mPsY5ed \u00e2\u0080\u0094 FOX Sports: NFL (@NFLonFOX) January 6, 2019\n\nCowboys owner Jerry Jones revealed after the game that Hurns immediately underwent surgery after leaving the stadium. According to Jones, Hurns dislocated his ankle and fractured his knee.\n\nKicker problems\n\nOne storyline that was hanging over the second half of this game was the health of Sebastian Janikowski. The Seahawks kicker injured himself while attempting a 57-yard field goal at the end of the first half, and by the start of the third quarter, he had been ruled doubtful to return before eventually being ruled out. That left the kicking duties to Seahawks punter Michael Dickson, who isn't exactly known for his ability to placekick.\n\nUm, if this comes down to a field goal, the Seahawks might be in trouble. #SEAvsDAL #Cowboys #Seahawks pic.twitter.com/g4Iolwq1FB \u00e2\u0080\u0094 John Breech (@johnbreech) January 6, 2019\n\nDickson was missing field goals left and right during his halftime warm-up, and apparently, things were so bad that Pete Carroll decided not to attempt any kicks in the second half.\n\nThe Seahawks scored two touchdowns in the second half and after each score, Carroll decided to go for two (the Seahawks scored on both conversions). Although Dickson wasn't forced to try a game-winning field goal, he did kill any chances Seattle had of winning when botched the onside kick with 1:16 left to play. Someone must have forgotten to tell Dickson that an onside kick only needs to go 10 yards, because he sent it more than 30 yards down the field.\n\nWorst onside kick ever of all time pic.twitter.com/2Ol4FiulXW \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Barstool Sports (@barstooltweetss) January 6, 2019\n\nThe big kick was good news for Cole Beasley, who made the easiest onside recovery of his life.\n\nUp next\n\nAlthough the Cowboys will definitely be playing in the Divisional Round next week, they won't find out who they're playing until after the Eagles-Bears game on Sunday. If the favored Bears come away with the win, then the Cowboys will be headed for New Orleans in a game that would be played on January 13. This will be a rematch of a Week 13 game played in Dallas where the Cowboys upset the Saints 13-10. On the other hand, if the Eagles pull off the upset in Chicago, then Dallas will be headed to Los Angeles for a Saturday night showdown with the Rams.\n\nAs for the Seahawks, their season is now over, which means they can start focusing on things like the combine and free agency. The Seahawks can also turn their eyes to the draft. Since they were eliminated in the wild-card round, the Seahawks will pick either 21st or 22nd during the first round of the 2019 NFL Draft.\n\nIf you want to keep reading about the game, you can re-live everything from the Cowboys' win in our blog below.", "title": "Cowboys vs. Seahawks final score, takeaways Dallas rides Ezekiel Elliott to wild playoff win over Seattle", "dataset": "auto_google", "labels": "['sport_news']", "annot_city": "[]"}, {"id": 4596, "city": "Seattle", "url": "https://fortune.com/2019/01/24/amazon-delivery-robots-seattle/", "text": "Protests across the U.S. reveal empathy and its enemy", "title": "Amazon Delivery Robots Hit the Doorsteps of Seattle", "dataset": "auto_google", "labels": "['redundant']", "annot_city": "[]"}, {"id": 4597, "city": "Seattle", "url": "https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/25694182/sebastian-janikowski-seattle-seahawks-ruled-game-thigh-injury", "text": "ARLINGTON, Texas -- Seattle Seahawks kicker Sebastian Janikowski suffered a thigh injury while attempting a field goal on the final play of the first half and was ruled out for the rest of Saturday night's 24-22 wild-card loss to the Dallas Cowboys.\n\nWith Janikowski out, the Seahawks attempted successful two-point tries on their only two touchdowns of the second half, and had rookie punter Michael Dickson handle the ensuing kickoffs. They converted a fourth-and-5 from the Dallas 39-yard line before the first of those two scores -- a Russell Wilson 4-yard touchdown run -- though they might have been in four-down territory there even with a healthy Janikowski.\n\nSeattle coach Pete Carroll said Janikowski's absence forced Seattle to adjust its playcalling with an eye toward avoiding field goal situations.\n\n\"Absolutely. We had to change. We were in a different mode,\" Carroll said. \"We were still ready to kick a field goal if we had to, but we were going to do what we could to avoid that and not make that the issue.\"\n\nAlthough it was announced as a thigh injury, Carroll said Janikowski \"really hurt his hamstring\" on the attempt.\n\n\"I would think he just tried to kick it as hard as he could and hurt himself,\" Carroll said. \"He's never had that happen before.\"\n\nThe play on which Janikowski's absence might have hurt the Seahawks the most was following a late Wilson-to-J.D. McKissic touchdown throw, which was followed by Chris Carson's conversion run. Dickson attempted an onside dropkick into a vacated area behind Dallas' initial line of players, but the Cowboys caught the kick in the air to seal the victory.\n\n\"I wish Mikey could've found a better place to drop that kick so we had a better shot at it,\" Carroll said. \"It was unfortunate. We had plenty of time. We had 1:18 left. We get the ball right there, we're going to have a real shot at winning that game.\"\n\nCarroll said after Janikowski briefly left the Seahawks' win over the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 16 that Dickson would dropkick his field goal and extra point attempts if the team ever needed him.\n\nSeahawks Backers Convert Late Sebastian Janikowski's absence might have hurt the Seahawks, but it sure helped some bettors. Chris Carson's two-point conversion run for Seattle -- necessitated by Janikowski being unable to kick -- with 1:18 remaining made it a 24-22 game. The closing line was -2.5 for the Cowboys. Carson's conversion and the late TD also pushed the game over the total of 43.\n\nDickson, who is from Sydney and grew up playing Australian rules football, was practicing field goals at halftime with Wilson holding after Janikowski was hurt on a missed 57-yard attempt at the end of the second quarter. Dickson is usually Seattle's holder. Several of his kicks were hooked to the right, though he and Wilson embraced after appearing to end on a make.\n\nAfter Wilson scored on a 4-yard run with 2:03 left in the third quarter, the Seahawks chose to go for two rather than have Dickson kick the extra point. They converted the attempt and went up 14-10.\n\nA dropkicked extra point in a playoff game wouldn't have been unprecedented, though it has been a long time since it happened. According to the Pro Football Hall of Fame via ESPN Stats & Information, Ray \"Scooter\" McLean of the Bears successfully dropkicked an extra point following Ken Kavanaugh's 42-yard fumble recovery for a touchdown during Chicago's 37-9 win over the New York Giants in the 1941 NFL Championship Game.\n\nAccording to the PHOF, Hall of Famer Earl \"Dutch\" Clark is believed to be the last player to successfully dropkick a field goal in the NFL. According to game accounts, he dropkicked a 17-yard field goal in the Detroit Lions 16-7 victory over the Chicago Cardinals on Sept. 19, 1937.\n\nDickson was named a first-team All-Pro and became the first rookie punter to make the Pro Bowl since 1985.\n\nSeattle's only points at halftime came on Janikowski field goals from 27 and 42 yards. According to ESPN Stats & Info, those were his first made field goals in the playoffs since Super Bowl XXXVII after the 2002 season.\n\nJanikowski signed a one-year deal with the Seahawks and will be an unrestricted free agent this offseason.", "title": "Sebastian Janikowski of Seattle Seahawks ruled out for game with thigh injury", "dataset": "auto_google", "labels": "['sport_news']", "annot_city": "[]"}, {"id": 4598, "city": "San Francisco", "url": "https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Huge-storm-descends-on-Bay-Area-to-bring-rain-13538068.php", "text": "Relentless rain pounded Northern California, slicked highways and contributed to two fatal traffic accidents that killed four people in the Sierra foothills and Wine Country.\n\nThe rain also was being blamed Wednesday for toppling a tree that fell onto a homeless encampment in Oakland, killing an unidentified person.\n\nMudslides, hail, high winds, toppled trees, snow and downed power lines were all part of the biggest storm of the new year as an atmospheric river and cold front grabbed hold of the Bay Area and is not expected to let go until Thursday.\n\nToo much water was everywhere.

An avalanche warning closed part of Highway 88 near the Kirkwood ski area.\n\nIn the Lake Tahoe area, up to 5 feet of snow is expected in the higher elevations and close to 2 feet at the lake level, forecasters said.\n\nAnd scenic Highway 1 along the Big Sur coast was closed at two locations due to storm conditions, Caltrans said.\n\nLightning strikes were spotted Wednesday off the coast and in parts of Point Reyes and San Mateo, according to the National Weather Service.\n\nThursday, \u00e2\u0080\u009cwhen there\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a more cold, unstable air mass around, we could see lots of reports of small hail,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Walbrun said.\n\nSarah Ravani, Gwendolyn Wu and Steve Rubenstein are San Francisco Chronicle staff writers.

Shares of parent company PG&E Corp. closed at $13.99, up 16.5 percent.\n\nThe court papers made official what PG&E told employees earlier this month due to a new California wildfire law that requires 15 days advance notice to workers before a change of control in the company, which the law defines to include filing for bankruptcy protection.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThe power and gas will stay on,\u00e2\u0080\u009d PG&E wrote in a statement posted on its website. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe will continue to provide you with reliable electric and natural gas service, and that will not change as a result of this process. To be very clear, we are not \u00e2\u0080\u0098going out of business,\u00e2\u0080\u0099 and there will be no disruption in the services you expect from us.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPG&E Corp.\u00e2\u0080\u0099s filing listed $71.4 billion in assets and $51.7 billion in debt. Pacific Gas and Electric Co. accounted for almost all of those amounts, with its petition listing $71.2 billion in assets and $51.4 billion in debt.\n\nExperts agreed the bankruptcy filing by California\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest utility won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t affect its customers\u00e2\u0080\u0099 ability to keep their lights on. But the process has potential to spur fundamental changes, such as a possible sale of the gas side of the business, as the company reorganizes. It could also eventually affect customer rates and delay or reduce the payments received by thousands of wildfire victims who have sued PG&E.\n\nGov. Gavin Newsom said PG&E\u00e2\u0080\u0099s filing was the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s decision and does not deter his focus on \u00e2\u0080\u009cprotecting the best interests of the people of California.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cMy administration will continue working to ensure that Californians have access to safe, reliable and affordable service, that victims and employees are treated fairly, and that California continues to make forward progress on our climate change goals,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Newsom said in a statement.\n\nIn the short term, the filing will place restrictions on PG&E\u00e2\u0080\u0099s operations by putting the company under supervision of a bankruptcy court and limiting its ability to make any major decisions without the court\u00e2\u0080\u0099s approval.\n\nPG&E\u00e2\u0080\u0099s interim CEO John Simon, the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s general counsel who stepped into the top role earlier this month following the resignation of Geisha Williams, told employees in an email Tuesday that the company expects the bankruptcy process to last about two years.\n\nHe stressed in the email, a copy of which was obtained by The Chronicle, that the 16 million people served by PG&E will continue receiving electricity and gas, and the company\u00e2\u0080\u0099s workforce of approximately 24,000 will still be paid and receive health care benefits. He also said \u00e2\u0080\u009cthere are bound to be surprises\u00e2\u0080\u009d as PG&E goes under supervision of the bankruptcy court.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThroughout this process, our call to action is to further improve our operations and business practices so that we emerge from reorganization as a company that is positioned to serve our communities safely and reliably for many years to come,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Simon wrote.\n\nThe bankuptcy proceedings opened Tuesday afternoon with a 75-minute hearing before U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali of San Francisco, who also presided over PG&E\u00e2\u0080\u0099s 2001 bankruptcy. With every seat taken in his court and an overflow courtroom next door, Montali scheduled hearings for four days a month through April on PG&E\u00e2\u0080\u0099s plans to reorganize and pay its debts and any competing plans submitted by wildfire victims and others with claims against the utility.\n\nPG&E is planning a \u00e2\u0080\u009csmooth transition\u00e2\u0080\u009d into bankruptcy, with a filing that contains \u00e2\u0080\u009cnothing unusual except the numbers,\u00e2\u0080\u009d attorney Tobias Keller told Montali.\n\nThe judge also scheduled a hearing Thursday to hear the utility\u00e2\u0080\u0099s opening statement and short-term financing measures and any objections voiced by the U.S. bankruptcy trustee\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office, an arm of the Justice Department.\n\nThe bankruptcy filing provoked a strong reaction from PG&E\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest union, IBEW Local 1245, which represents about 12,000 company employees. The union does not know what shape the company will take when it emerges from bankruptcy but indicated it opposed some of the major changes the process could produce, Tom Dalzell, the union\u00e2\u0080\u0099s business manager, said in a statement.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cParceling out the utility into smaller, weaker segments would unquestionably have a negative impact on the safety and stability of both gas and electric service, it would increase costs, and it would decelerate progress toward California\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ambitious clean energy goals,\u00e2\u0080\u009d Dalzell said in the statement. \u00e2\u0080\u009cFurthermore, selling or municipalizing some or all of PG&E\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gas or electric transmission or distribution systems would not solve the overarching issue of climate change and the strict liability policies that have put PG&E and all other California utilities on an unsustainable trajectory.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPG&E has said its liability from 2017 and 2018 wildfires could exceed $30 billion, but that was before state investigators cleared the company of being responsible for one of the worst blazes, the Tubbs Fire, which devastated parts of Santa Rosa in 2017.\n\nThe California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, or Cal Fire, issued a finding last week that said the wildfire was caused by privately controlled electrical equipment, not PG&E power lines.\n\nAttorneys for fire victims said they can still argue PG&E was responsible for the Tubbs Fire and vowed to continue with their efforts. Cal Fire has said PG&E was responsible for a series of other fires that burned in Northern California in October 2017.\n\nThe most decisive wildfire problem for PG&E, however, has proved to be last year\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Camp Fire, which killed 86 people and burned more than 18,800 buildings in Butte County, making it both the deadliest and most destructive fire in state history. PG&E has detailed two sources of malfunctioning equipment: a transmission tower near one suspected origin point for the fire and another distribution line in the area, fueling widespread speculation that the inferno will be blamed on the utility.\n\nShares of PG&E Corp. plummeted after the Camp Fire and took a nosedive after the company announced its plan to seek bankruptcy protection earlier this month.\n\nThe bankruptcy filing comes about 18 years after PG&E\u00e2\u0080\u0099s utility subsidiary sought bankruptcy protection because of the early 2000s energy crisis. That case is still open, PG&E noted in its new filing. But the circumstances differ: PG&E\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current financial problems stem from the future wildfire liability it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s staring down, whereas the 2001 Chapter 11 filing was motivated by a more immediate cash flow problem caused by high electricity costs.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cIt was quite a different situation, and it had nothing to do with liability,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Paul Patterson, an analyst with Glenrock Associates.\n\nPG&E\u00e2\u0080\u0099s dire financial straits today also involve more claims that the utility might be shown to be directly responsible for, allegedly by maintaining its equipment poorly, Patterson said.\n\nAnother significant difference is that the parent company is joining the utility in bankruptcy. In 2001, PG&E sought to keep its unregulated energy businesses separate from the regulated utility, but now, its utility is its primary business.\n\nThe need for PG&E\u00e2\u0080\u0099s current bankruptcy filing had been questioned by some, including activists and some shareholders.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cWe think that PG&E is being very irresponsible by filing for bankruptcy when it is financially solvent,\u00e2\u0080\u009d said Mark Toney, executive director of The Utility Reform Network. \u00e2\u0080\u009cWe really see the bankruptcy as a way for PG&E to try to duck its responsibilities and accountability for its criminal behavior.\u00e2\u0080\u009d\n\nPG&E has consistently said that the company viewed a Chapter 11 filing as the only viable path for the business.\n\nSteve Malnight, the utility\u00e2\u0080\u0099s senior vice president of energy supply and policy, said in an interview that the company faces a \u00e2\u0080\u009cmassive potential liability\u00e2\u0080\u009d because of thousands of claims against it stemming from the 2017 and 2018 wildfires, with thousands more likely coming related to the Camp Fire.\n\nThat liability prompted multiple credit downgrades that limited PG&E\u00e2\u0080\u0099s ability to access funding it needs to safely operate its system, Malnight said.\n\n\u00e2\u0080\u009cThat is something that we could not put at risk,\u00e2\u0080\u009d he said.\n\nThe bankruptcy filing isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the only wildfire-fueled obstacle in PG&E\u00e2\u0080\u0099s path. The federal judge overseeing its probation from the 2010 San Bruno pipeline explosion has also proposed a sweeping fire prevention plan that PG&E has said is infeasible. A hearing is scheduled for Wednesday in San Francisco.\n\nChronicle staff writer Bob Egelko contributed to this report.\n\nJ.D. Morris is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Thx. \u00e2\u0080\u0094 Gavin Newsom (@GavinNewsom) October 2, 2018\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (KGO) -- Gavin Newsom's meteoric rise to become governor of California has not been an easy one.He faced harsh criticism from fellow Democrats for igniting the same-sex marriage debate in 2004 when San Francisco began granting official marriage licenses to same-sex couples.His words, \"It's going to happen, whether you like it or not,\" were used to invigorate conservative voters.Newsom is often outspoken. He describes the National Rifle Association as \"morally bankrupt\" and accused President Donald Trump for \"operating as if he's a monarch.\"Even though he was born into a prominent San Francisco family -- his father William Newsom was a California state appeals court judge with close ties to billionaire Gordon Getty -- his childhood was not easy.Newson suffers from dyslexia, which he said made school a terrible and terrorizing experience. He opened up about the condition a few years ago on ABC7's \"Beyond the Headlines ,\" saying that he felt dumb in school.\"I rarely read speeches and if I do they are the worst things I ever do,\" said Newsom, who prefers to improvise when speaking in public.He's had a long time to hone those skills. He was just 30 years old when he was appointed by former Mayor Willie Brown to fill a vacancy on the Board of Supervisors in 1997.As supervisor he championed several controversial initiatives that won the backing of voters. Care Not Cash replaced cash payments to homeless in exchange for housing and social services in 2002. A year later, Proposition M banned aggressive panhandling in public areas.Just 34 days after becoming mayor of San Francisco in 2004, Newsom directed the city clerk to issue same-sex marriage licenses. The courts debated the legality of these unions for more than a decade until the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2015 that they were a right guaranteed by the Constitution.In 2007, Newsom introduced Healthy San Francisco , which provided universal healthcare for all city residents. San Francisco was the first city in the nation to implement such a policy.Since he became lieutenant governor, Newsom pushed for the legalization of recreational cannabis and pushed for more strict gun control laws in the state.He has also tussled with the White House. He recently sent a tweet to Trump, asking to debate him directly after the president criticized Newsom.", "title": "VIDEO Looking back at Gavin Newsom's rise from renegade San Francisco mayor to governor of California", "dataset": "auto_google", "labels": "['local_politics']", "annot_city": "[]"}]
