Here's the latest:

Coronavirus infections in New York City are continuing to climb to worrisome levels not seen in months as health experts warn about difficult winter ahead.

Mayor Bill de Blasio on Thursday said that the city's seven-day average positivity rate had risen to 5.2%, the highest it has been in six months.

The city has now surpassed two of three warning markers that the mayor initially announced in August as a way of knowing whether the virus had gotten out of control.

Officials determined a 5% threshold for the positivity rate, and 550 for the seven-day average number of new cases. The city blew past the latter number in late October. Average daily cases are now closing in on 2,000.

In another bad sign, 174 patients were recently admitted to hospitals for COVID-19 or flu-like symptoms. The warning marker for that indicator is 200.

""What we are now seeing more than we have seen in a long long time unfortunately is these three indicators moving in the wrong direction,"" the mayor said during his morning press conference. ""It’s quite clear at this point that this second wave is right upon us.""

Governor Andrew Cuomo has ordered hospitals to draw up emergency plans and expand capacity. While he also expressed concern, de Blasio said hospitals were nonetheless better equipped to handle a surge of patients than they were in the spring.

This week, city officials began urging New Yorkers over 65 and those with underlying conditions to stay at home.

Health experts are bracing for the worst across the country.

Dr. Robert Redfield, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said Wednesday that the winter months could be “the most difficult in the public health history of this nation.""

Speaking at a U.S. Chamber of Commerce event, he said deaths had been rising. The country is now recording between 1,500 and 2,500 deaths everyday.

He said total fatalities, which are now around 272,000, could approach 450,000 before February.

Although the first vaccines are expected to arrive in the next few weeks, Redfield warned that precautionary measures would still be necessary for many months and predicted that large gatherings would not officially resume until the fall of 2021.",Coronavirus Updates: New York City's Virus Positivity Rate Hits Highest Level In 6 Months,['manual_google_by_location'],"['health', 'public_space']",['New York']
8710,,https://nypost.com/2020/12/03/nycs-homeless-student-population-could-soon-skyrocket/,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.

The city’s homeless student population dipped slightly last year — but advocates warn that the numbers may be skewed due to the coronavirus and could soon skyrocket.

According to Advocates for Children of New York, 111,000 children were identified as homeless during the 2019-2020 academic year — a dip of 2.2 percent from the prior term.

Of those, about 32,700 lived in homeless shelters while roughly 73,000 were “doubled up” in temporary housing situations with friends or family, according to ACNY.

In the Bronx, 1 in 6 students were homeless last year, the organization reported, citing state data. The city’s homeless students are 85 percent African American and Hispanic, they added.

ACNY cautioned that the slight decrease could be attributable to the difficulty in tracking homeless kids because of technology gaps or lack of Department of Education contact with families.

“The vast scale of student homelessness in New York City demands urgent attention,” said Kim Sweet, executive director of Advocates for Children.

Sweet warned that the city’s already staggering number of homeless students — which is higher than the entire public school population of Vermont — is likely to worsen.

The impact of the coronavirus on the city’s economy is likely to exacerbate homelessness — especially when eviction moratoriums are lifted, she said.

“The City must act now to put more support in place for students who are homeless,” Sweet said.

The organization stressed that the damage wrought by youth homelessness is being magnified this year due to the introduction of remote learning.

Many kids in shelters do not have reliable devices or Wi-Fi availability and are struggling badly as a result, the group said.

For homeless kids, remote learning “may mean trying to complete assignments on a smartphone in the middle of a noisy and overcrowded room,” ACNY said.

The group urged the Department of Education and City Hall to improve its provision of technology and to use attendance data to target kids who are slipping out of sight.

The DOE should also prioritize homeless students for full-time classroom instruction when possible, ACNY said.

“Learning from home is much harder when you don’t have a permanent home,” Sweet said.",NYC’s homeless student population could skyrocket due to COVID-19,['manual_google_by_location'],['homelessness'],['New York']

More than 600 miles of subway tracks carve through the streets of New York City, but the 7 train, which runs along Queens’s bustling Roosevelt Avenue, glides above perhaps the most ethnically diverse urban area in the world.

Hundreds of thousands of New Yorkers live between the line’s 69th Street to 103rd Street stops, which serve five neighborhoods — Corona, East Elmhurst, Elmhurst, Jackson Heights and Woodside. The area has long been a setting for ambitious New York Times storytelling, allowing reporters to capture the borough’s range of cuisines, street life, aesthetics, living conditions and dreams.

“Queens is so endlessly fascinating because it’s really the heart and soul of the city’s ever-changing diversity,” said Dan Barry, a reporter who was born in Jackson Heights. “Dozens of languages being spoken — you know, every time I talk to a demographer the number goes up; it’s 160 languages spoken, 180 languages spoken.”",A Painstaking Portrait of Some of New York’s Darkest Days,['manual_google_by_location'],['not_sure'],['New York']

8713,,https://nypost.com/2020/12/03/ny-small-businesses-cant-handle-minimum-wage-hike-right-now/,"Pandemic restrictions have forced many employers to furlough workers, cut staffs and even close entirely. And many of those remaining now face the prospect of having to pay a higher minimum wage as of Jan. 1 — which will likely kill more jobs.

But Gov. Andrew Cuomo can delay it.

“The last thing New York’s economy needs is a state-mandated disincentive to put people back to work,” notes the Empire Center’s E.J. McMahon. This sure isn’t the economic climate that lawmakers expected.

The minimum hourly wage, already $15 in the city, is to rise from $13 to $14 (7.7 percent) in Long Island and Westchester, and from $11.80 to $12.50 (5.9 percent) in the rest of the state. That’s bigger than most employers’ profit margins.

As McMahon points out, the state Division of the Budget can recommend a “temporary suspension or delay” of the hikes based on an analysis of regional economies. And unemployment and business closures are up in every region; every county and municipal government has falling tax revenues.

The numbers of jobless statewide “still remain over 1 million,” state Comptroller Tom DiNapoli revealed this week. Nearly a third of the nearly 1.1 million net jobs lost February-October, he noted, were in the leisure and hospitality sector — which will suffer again in the second virus wave.

As he’s also noted, “New York’s small businesses reported greater overall negative impacts from the pandemic, along with greater expectations of such impacts lingering for months to come, than most other states.” Nearly a third expect they’ll need to obtain financial assistance or additional capital in the next six months. Don’t hit them with a new cost instead.

It shouldn’t be too hard for the gov and his budget chief, Robert Mujica, to conclude that a wage-hike mandate now would be a deadly blow to small businesses — killing the jobs of those it aims to help.",NY small businesses can’t handle another minimum-wage hike right now,['manual_google_by_location'],['employment'],['New York']

8715,,https://www.ny1.com/nyc/all-boroughs/news/2020/12/03/this-is-what-tourism-looks-like-in-nyc-right-now,"Martin Blaine’s 10-year-old son is a big ""Hamilton"" fan and knows all the songs. Then he watched the animated musical series ""Central Park,"" and New York City started to become a major theme in their Ohio household.

The family of three stayed home most of the year, except for a trip to Arkansas for a family funeral. But with Martin and his wife’s anniversary in July and his wife’s birthday in September, they decided they could swing a short fall trip to celebrate the occasions without their son missing too much school.

“We were like, ‘Why don't we just go to New York?’” he said. “And then we were, like, ‘Well why would we go to New York? There's nothing to do in New York.’ But we looked around and there were still lots of things to do.”

One of those things was Broadway Up Close, a tour of Broadway’s theaters detailing the history and inner workings of everything it takes to put on a big show.

Tim Dolan, the founder of Broadway Up Close, has been bustling harder than he has since he founded the company in 2010, he said. His tour company and gift shop rely on tourists attending New York City’s theaters. And in 2020, that’s not happening.

On March 12, all 41 of New York City’s theaters closed their doors. They’re not expected to open back up until June 1, 2021 and, even then, there’s still uncertainty around which theaters will open at that time. With the reopening date pushed back multiple times thus far, many people in the industry think the reopening is more likely to take place closer to September of 2021.

This means that people who work in the tourism industry, like Dolan, have had to completely revamp the way their businesses operate in order to stay afloat.

In 2019, NYC tourism hit a record high—66.6 million individual trips with about $47.4 billion generated in direct spending for the city, according to the 2019 NYC & Company annual report. But by the end of 2020, tourism is expected to drop by about 66% to 22.9 million visitors, according to NYC & Co. It’s not expected to reach pre-pandemic numbers until 2025.

Before COVID-19 hit, the majority of Dolan’s profits came from the six in-person tours his company offered. Five of these were walking exterior theater tours and one tour included a visit inside the Hudson Theater.

“When the shutdown started, I refunded more money than I've ever refunded in my entire life,” Dolan said. “You feel the life slipping through your fingers.”

Dolan, an actor by trade, started his company understanding that working in the industry often means relying on an unpredictable stream of income. It’s why most of his staff are young actors themselves. But when COVID-19 hit, he had to furlough his 22 employees. Now the business operates with a staff of two—Dolan and a graphic designer who freelances for him.

In April 2019, he opened a brick and mortar shop across the street from the Minskoff Theatre, home to ""The Lion King"" musical. In the shop, people could buy typical Broadway-themed souvenirs, like t-shirts, hoodies, tote bags and keychains. He’s been able to hold on to the store despite its closed doors with support from the Times Square Alliance, the site's owner.

Not only did he take the entire gift shop online for the first time, but he also had to reimagine the type of merchandise he could sell. Most people aren’t interested in buying souvenirs for trips they haven’t taken.

“We have no tourists. We have no Broadway shows. We're not making any new New York memories or theater memories, specifically,” Dolan said, describing his thought process. “Let's cherish the ones that we've already created.”

That’s when he came up with the idea to do custom ticket stub souvenirs. Customers can input information from a ticket stub, like the name of the theater, the date and time, cost, and seat number, and Dolan creates an engraved ticket stub made of cherry wood.

“I'm making all of that literally in my apartment,” he said about the new types of merchandise he’s selling, including handmade wooden picture frames and ornaments. “Other than a tote bag, a t-shirt, and a magnet, I thought, ‘What else can we do to change the merchandise game while we have this moment of time that I might not have had otherwise?’”

Now it’s this virtual gift shop that’s keeping his business afloat.

But tours are still happening.

After taking some time to deal with those massive refunds at the onset of the pandemic, he decided he wanted to take his tours online. He started by putting videos on his company’s Instagram account. Then Playbill reached out to collaborate to do Zoom-hosted tours. It then evolved to Dolan doing his own virtual tours.

“We've garnered people from all over the world,” he said. “I just did one yesterday, and she was like, ‘It’s 4 a.m. here in Australia. Thanks for keeping me awake.’ I didn’t realize that.”

After Gov. Andrew Cuomo gave the green light for small in-person gatherings, he eventually began hosting walking tours again.

His company used to do about 10 to 14 tours a week. That number’s gone down to about one to three a week. And with out-of-state tourism down drastically, the clients he serves are almost all locals.

“I just kind of put it out there,” Dolan said. “For any New Yorkers who are bored in their studio apartments and want to get out for a minute—it's totally safe. Let's hang out in Times Square. There's no one here.”

But locals aren’t the only customers he takes on his in-person tours.

Every so often he gets out-of-towners like the Blaine family from Ohio, who visited at the end of September for four days. Currently, the quarantine guidelines for people arriving from out-of-state require people to get tested within three days of leaving for New York and after three days of quarantining in the city. If they test negative both times, they can bypass the 14-day quarantine. Even with an option for a three-day quarantine, this can make tourism difficult for people like the Blaines who did not quarantine on their brief trip.

The family figured that they’d keep the trip fairly simple—walk around, relax, and check out Central Park for the few days they were in town. But Martin, his wife, and son were surprised at how full of an experience they were able to have.

“For the month after we left, my son kept saying ‘I'm going to move to New York when I get older,’” Blaine said over the phone in November.

Other than the huge crowds, sporting events and Broadway shows, the Blaine family was able to see and do most of what they would want to do on a normal New York City vacation, including the Broadway Up Close tour.

“I showed up expecting there to be people,” Blaine said. “I figured that [Dolan] wouldn't just run this thing for the three of us, but yeah, it was just the three of us. It was really great. And it was even better because it was like we paid the regular price for a private tour.”

The Blaines aren’t the only ones who think New York is still worth visiting this year.

While the ferry station to Liberty Island is nowhere near the level of bustling it was pre-pandemic, tourists are still lining up to see the Statue of Liberty.

Jannyna and Katy Morillo came to New York City from Quito, Ecuador and stayed with Jannyna’s uncle in the Bronx. It was Katy’s first time seeing the city.

“I already know everything in the city, but for her [this is a first],” Jannyna said in Spanish. “We went to the Empire State Building, Madame Tussauds, and now the Statue of Liberty. This weekend we are having a family reunion for my uncle’s birthday.”

There were other groups of friends who traveled to the city as well, including a group from Texas.

“I would definitely come back,” said Gabby, 25. “I want to see more of the parks—it's really beautiful.”

That was the refrain from many tourists we spoke to who have recently visited New York City—that it was such a great experience it only affirmed their resolve to come back.

And that’s what is keeping Dolan’s spirits up and helping him concoct new ways to provide meaningful products and experiences for people who want to appreciate the city.

“It’s just about finding any way we can cherish this incredible city that is hurting really badly and our industry that's hurting really badly,” he said. “How do you embrace all of that, and cherish that until the lights turn back on?”",This Is What Tourism Looks Like In NYC Right Now,['manual_google_by_location'],['tourism'],['New York']

8717,,https://nypost.com/2020/12/03/nyc-hospital-begs-for-more-nurses-ahead-of-second-covid-19-wave/,"Sign up for our special edition newsletter to get a daily update on the coronavirus pandemic.

A Queens hospital that was overwhelmed with coronavirus patients in the spring has put out an urgent plea to recruit more nurses to handle an anticipated second wave of the illness this winter.

The 402-bed Jamaica Hospital Medical Center issued a job posting saying that “once again” it will need staff reinforcements to avoid getting caught short-handed with a surge of sick patients.

“Jamaica Hospital Medical Center and our affiliates need your help. Due to the increased number of COVID-19 cases now plaguing New York City and the anticipated surge of a second wave, we are now [entering] a new phase of COVID-response and are once again in need of experienced critical care, emergency room and medical surgical RNs for 12-hour flex per diem shift opportunities in our facilities,” Jamaica Hospital said in the job posting.

“If you are an experienced ER, Medical, Surgical or Critical Care nurse and willing to help us in this unprecedented fight please contact [us].”

Jamaica hospital had put out a similar appeal for staffers in late March as it dealt with the initial COVID-19 outbreak.

A Queens lawmaker whose district includes the Jamaica hospital said management there doesn’t want to scramble for reinforcements, if needed.

“It really is just being pro-active in the event of another spike,” said state Sen. Leroy Comrie.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Monday expressed concern about staff shortages and directed hospitals to compile a list of retired doctors and nurses that they can draw from because there are already staffing issues at some hospitals.

“I am very worried about staff shortages. I’m more concerned about the staff shortage than I am the [number of hospital] beds,” the governor said Monday.

“We can build beds. We can’t create more staff. And the staff is starting to get tired.”

Recruitment could be more difficult. During the spring, New York City was the epicenter of the deadly virus while other parts of the country were OK. Volunteer nurses and doctors came from other states to help New York hospitals handle the outbreak.

But hospitals in many other states are grappling with COVID-19 caseloads and need reinforcements.

The head of the trade group representing New York City’s 55 private and city-run hospitals insisted that staffing levels are currently sufficient to deal with a second COVID wave.

“We’re not going to see a repetition of the spring. It doesn’t mean we won’t have a bit of a challenge,” said Ken Raske, CEO of the Greater New York Hospital Association.

“We think our current inpatient staff will be able to handle the influx.”

He said hospitals have the flexibility to reassign existing staff — such as nurses and doctors who handle outpatients — to treat coronavirus patients in the emergency room or inpatient wards.

Also, Raske said staff can be redeployed among hospitals to help facilities grappling with outbreaks.

He noted 40 of the 55 hospitals belong to the same health care companies, providing the flexibility to redeploy staff including the city-run Health & Hospitals agency that manages 11 public hospitals, the NY Presbyterian hospital system, the Mount Sinai network, NYU hospitals and the Montefiore system in The Bronx.

Raske did say New York hospitals cannot count on medical volunteers from other parts of the country as they did in the spring, given the current outbreak in other states.

“That’s not going to be possible now,” he said.

Jamaica Hospital spokesman Michael Hinck said the recruitment campaign is precautionary. “Please understand that our recruitment efforts are purely a proactive measure on our part. We currently have an appropriate level of nurse staffing in all clinical areas. We recently began this recruitment campaign in anticipation of a potential second wave,” Hinck said.

Jamaica hospital currently has fewer than 30 COVID patients as opposed to approximately 300 hospitalized patients at the peak in early-mid April, he said.



“Because our hospital was located at the epicenter during the emergence of the pandemic we were fortunate to receive volunteer doctors and nurses from across the country. We are uncertain if we would receive the same level of assistance now as the virus is greatly affecting the entire nation,” Hinck said.



Meanwhile the New York City Medical Reserve Corps — run by the Health Department — currently has over 13,000 medical volunteers at the ready to staff city hospitals for another outbreak. The reserve corps has not received staffing requests from hospitals “but they are ready to deploy volunteers for surge staffing if necessary,” said Health Department spokeswoman Julia Morrill.

Moreover Northwell Health, the state’s largest private medical provider, said it has a reserve of 7,500 retired doctors, nurses and other clinicians at the ready to pitch in during a surge at its 23 regional hospitals, said spokesman Joe Kemp. Northwell operates Lenox Hill hospital on the Upper East Side, LIJ Forest Hills hospital and Staten Island University hospitals, among others.",Queens hospital begs for more nurses ahead of second COVID-19 wave,['manual_google_by_location'],"['health', 'indirect_city_relation']",['New York']

There also was a six-year high of 254 available ground-floor retail spots during the quarter.

Victoria’s Secret announced it would close many of its New York City locations, and the company is battling landlord SL Green over nearly $1 million in unpaid rent at its massive Herald Square store, which is currently closed.

Gap Inc. announced plans to close around 350 Banana Republic and Gap stores in North America by the end of 2023.

Thursday, December 3, 2020. Colder yesterday in New York; in the low 40s and then dropping mid-evening into the 30s with a RealFeel of 29 degrees: very cold.

The Beautiful Jean. I had dinner on Tuesday night with Mary Hilliard, one of our favorite photographers who’s been covering New Yorkers — here and abroad as well as in Palm Beach. In conversation about her business we wandered through personal association to Jean Howard, a major beauty of mid-20th century in Hollywood, New York and across the sea. Later on in the evening, after dinner, Mary sent me this photograph she took of Jean in 1989 at Mortimer’s restaurant with its owner Glenn Birnbaum and Lauren Bacall. It was a party for the publication of Jean’s first book of photographs, a photographic memoir, “Jean Howard’s Hollywood.”

The title was apt in the sense that the little girl born Ernestine Mahoney in Fort Worth, Texas in 1910, who went on to become, in her uniquely quiet way, one of the most celebrated beauties (and personalities) in her world – in her time. I never heard the details of her childhood, but her father was a traveling salesman, her mother had a serious drug addiction — it may have been morphine; this was in the second decade of the 20th century — dying when Jean was still very young.

When she was old enough, because of her mother’s condition, her father often took his daughter on his trips to the big cities, and especially New York. The bright lights caught the young girl’s imagination, and as fate had it, when she was 21 she was hired by Florenz Ziegfeld to appear in his 1931 Ziegfeld Follies. It was the last of the Follies, which lost its dazzle with the Depression. But it was the beginning of a brilliant career/life in the world that was just unfolding for everyone, and for now Jean Howard.

I don’t know where Louis B. Mayer first met or spotted her — very possibly while attending a performance of the Follies. It was easy for him to be introduced to her. Now a successful mogul in his late 40s, and shining with stature with his own Studio, Mayer had begun cheating on his wife Margaret, mother of his two daughters, Edie Goetz and Irene Selznick. He was looking to return to his own youth with such a beauty by his side.

Jean, however, did respond to his wishes to have her tested for a studio contract. She accompanied him to events and even traveled to Paris with him, although at her insistence chaperoned by a slightly older friend. She was not interested in being his wife or girlfriend. The frustrated Mayer threatened to kill himself by jumping from their hotel window if she didn’t marry him. Jean and her friend were on the first ocean liner back to New York.

It was about the same time she met a young, handsome and successful talent agent named Charles Feldman. He spotted her one night at a nightclub in the Beverly Wilshire Hotel and sent a note to her the following morning asking if he could see her the following evening to discuss a very important matter. I don’t know Jean’s side of the story, but she agreed.

You could tell by the note he sent her, knowing the after story, that he was flummoxed on the sight of her. She was a great natural beauty, with charisma suggesting that it was total. I had first read about her in a Cole Porter biography published in the early ’60s and I first met her in 1978 at a small dinner at the home of Merle Oberon and Rob Wolders in the Malibu Colony. It was like walking into film history for this writer.

The guests were William (Willie) Wyler and his wife Tally, Luis Estevez, the fashion designer, and a close friend of Merle’s who was an old friend of mine and had arranged for my presence — knowing my curiosity — and Jean Howard and her second husband Tony Santoro, a guitarist she met when she heard him in a small café on the island of Capri where she was often a guest of Mona Bismarck.

The story of their meeting in that café is classic. Tony was a very nice, soft spoken man, about fifteen or maybe twenty years her junior. When she told me the story of the night, she was with two gentlemen friends of hers, rich Americans of middle age both of whom had their eye on the guitarist. They even flipped a coin over him. Invited to their table after a set, Jean and Tony were at the right place at the right time. They returned to Beverly Hills together and remained in residence to the end of her life.

I don’t know much about Jean’s professional career. I knew her because of her association with Cole Porter, and that she was married to Charlie Feldman who owned the Ashley-Famous Agency and produced the first Woody Allen film. Meeting her that night at Merle’s was fascinating to me because there was a natural serenity in her presence and her beauty was outshone by her presence. She was open and curious, but warm and friendly, and you had the feeling that she was always like this. It was a subtle charm.

As I got to know her throughout the ‘70s and ‘80s, I was in her thrall. She had the sophistication of her environment and the ole Texas girl quiet razz-ma-tazz right underneath — while maybe slipping in an interesting and sharp insight about a personality she was describing. And there was that easy gentle, quiet laugh that came out of that smile. She lived in a wonderful hacienda style house at 2000 Coldwater Canyon which she and Charlie Feldman bought in 1935. When I knew her the house had been long ago decorated by Elsie De Wolfe/Lady Mendl, who during the Second World War had returned from Europe to the U.S and settled in house just down the road from the Feldmans. She gave the Feldman hacienda style and the California classic feeling; quietly comfortable.

That was when Beverly Hills was mainly countryside and 2000 Coldwater was one of the few houses in the area. After they divorced, Jean and Charlie shared use of the residence six months each until he finally, having remarried, gave it to her.

There was a black baby grand in one corner of the music gallery overlooking the courtyard. On it was a single silver framed portrait of Cole Porter with the handwritten inscription: To the beautiful Jean” and signed “Love Cole”.

Jean later was heir to several bequests in Cole’s will. His wife Linda left her collection of jewels to Jean as well as other items of furniture that fit in to Lady Mendl design. Nights at Jean’s dinners often ended around the piano with the local talent (Judy Garland, Richard Burton, Sammy Davis, and many others over the years). It was relaxed but it was, in keeping with the fashion of the times in Hollywood, long dresses, suit and tie, maybe black tie at times.

There was one such dinner party on the night of July 13, 1960 when John F. Kennedy was nominated for the Presidency downtown at the LA Memorial Coliseum. Jean’s guests were celebrating his nomination, and her guests had finally gone home long after midnight when the nominee himself arrived at a side door of the rambling hacienda, solo, and happy to be there.

She took up photography sometime in the late ’40s or early ‘50s. It was out of interest, but not from the point of view as a hobby. She was trained by a female photographer well known in the community. Jean lived and worked around professionals all her life.

The objective was to Be Your Best to your audience. This was assumed in all her work. Her book “Jean Howard’s Hollywood” is now a classic, a piece of art in the sense that her photographs reflect the feeling I’ve described about being around her. She clearly made a life for herself as a hostess. And it had a quiet glamour that was Hollywood — a name in that age for one of the most glamorous places in the world – and she was a great hostess. Everyone felt comfortable in her presence. It came with her personality.

Looking at Mary’s photo of Jean taken at the book party in Mortimer’s with Glenn Birnbaum and Lauren Bacall (who is photographed with Humphrey Bogart in the book) taken in the early days of their marriage, I was looking at a much older Jean than I had seen in the days I had got to know her. But the face, which looks so perfect, was the same face, and the perfection — perhaps assisted later in her life — was the same. It was in the eyes, the way she looked at you in conversation, the eyes on you; that was the charisma.

She was in her 79th year in that photograph of Mary’s. I was reminded how a few years before she had told me that she was proud of the fact that as she was getting older she had been honest about her age. But by 78, she wished she’d cut a few years off much earlier, thinking maybe that would even return herself to that energy and perception.

The Princeton grad and former Vanity Fair contributing editor — and current head of global brand strategy at Snapchat — has purchased a co-op at 15 W. 81st St., a classic Emery Roth-designed landmarked building, according to property records.

The three-bedroom, 3½-bathroom unit first went on the market in January for $6.4 million and was last asking $5.99 million.

Kenny and Lack were married from 1992 until their split last year. Lack presided over the Matt Lauer scandal (ultimately firing Lauer).

The “classic seven” has views over the Museum of Natural History and Central Park to the city skyline.

The home has been renovated and features the original herringbone floors, doors, moldings and hardware.

The home opens to a 27-foot gallery that leads from the living room to a formal dining room.

There’s also an L-shaped kitchen with an original casement window, subway tiles and St. Charles cabinetry, along with a separate bedroom wing.

Building amenities include a gym, playroom and separate storage.

The listing brokers were Michael J. Franco, Greg Holzmann and Miriam Richards, of Compass.

8722,,https://therealdeal.com/2020/12/03/cuomo-to-ease-requirements-for-rent-relief/,"The eligibility requirements for New York’s rent-relief program will be relaxed so that more can access the funds.

Details of the specific changes to the program were not provided, but sources said Gov. Andrew Cuomo would make the change via an executive order issued late Thursday or Friday morning.

The rent-relief program, which was passed in July, came under criticism from tenant groups who said the relief was insufficient. The first day the program was available, a flood of applications temporarily crashed the rental assistance website.

Just 57,000 of the 94,000 applicants who sought relief were successful. Lawyers representing tenants warned that if the legislature did not act, the remaining funds — $60 million out of an initial $100 million — would go to waste. The funds were provided under the CARES Act and will be returned to the federal government if not spent by Dec. 30.

Jay Martin, the executive director of the Community Housing Improvement Program, which represents landlords, said the amount of aid was small relative to the overall need, but still “good news” for property owners.

The Legal Aid Society, a nonprofit which represents low-income tenants, criticized the state for waiting until the last moment to make changes to the program.

“Albany has just weeks to recalibrate this program to ensure that $60 million in resources reaches New Yorkers facing eviction and homelessness,” said Judith Goldiner, an attorney at the nonprofit. “This crisis was wholly self-made, the result of Albany waiting until the last second to act and then doing so only in the face of headlines and public pressure.”

Legal Aid, as well as other tenant advocate groups, said the program was flawed from the beginning, because of uneven access to the application process, strict eligibility requirements and insufficient relief.

Those groups instead advocated for bills which would cancel rent across the board for renters, and provide limited, means-tested aid to landlords.

Those bills, however, have not progressed since being introduced in the spring, despite a letter from state Sen. Michael Gianaris asking President-elect Joe Biden to cancel rent.",New York to Relax Rent Relief Requirements,['manual_google_by_location'],"['housing', 'policy']",['New York']

The State Thruway Authority voted Tuesday to raise tolls by 30% for people who are driving on the Thruway without an E-ZPass, a device that collects toll information and charges drivers.

The Thruway eliminated cash tolls in November. That means drivers without an E-ZPass are sent a bill by mail.

In addition to the 30% higher toll, drivers billed by mail will also be charged a $2 administrative fee every time they are billed.

This is the first time in 10 years that tolls on the Thruway have been raised, the State Thruway Authority said. The revenue from the increase will support the conversion to cashless tolling.

Tolls will also increase for most drivers crossing the Gov. Mario M. Cuomo Bridge in 2021 and 2022.",Tolls Increase on NY Thruway for Drivers Without E-ZPass,['manual_google_by_location'],"['public_announce', 'indirect_city_relation']",['New York']
8725,,https://nypost.com/2020/12/03/armed-thieves-rob-nyc-bodega-with-kid-inside-video/,"A gunman and an accomplice robbed a Bronx bodega — with an employee’s terrified 6-year-old daughter inside, new video released by cops shows.

The suspects entered the store on Featherbed Lane in Morris Heights around 7:30 p.m. Sunday, cops said.

The video, released late Wednesday, shows one of the men running past the little girl — the daughter of a 51-year-old store employee — who waves her arms around before running for cover.

That suspect then grabs the cash register door, holding $700, and makes a beeline for the door.

Then, the other suspect, holding a gun in one hand, pushes the girl’s mother with the other.

She gets back up and continues fighting with him, chasing him out of the store.

Both suspects fled into a black SUV, cops said.

No shots were fired and no injuries were reported.

The same store was targeted during another armed robbery back on Nov. 21, just after midnight, cops said.

Police say an employee, also identified as a 51-year-old woman, was working behind the counter when two men entered, one of them flashing a gun and demanding property.

The other went behind the counter, stole about $150 from the register and took off.

The suspects are believed to be between 20 and 30 years old.

And back on Sept. 27, around 6 p.m., a 63-year-old woman was sitting in her car outside the store when a woman got out of a double-parked vehicle, walked up to her and punched her in the face, police sources said.

When the victim tried to take down her attacker’s license plate number, a man approached, grabbed her by the neck and pushed her out of the car and onto the ground, according to the sources.

The woman was treated at the scene for bruising to her head and cuts on her knees and elbows. She was not hospitalized.

Police at the time released surveillance photos of the male suspect, whom they described as between 20 and 30 years old. He was shown in the images wearing a red Los Angeles Angels cap.

In addition to improving tax incentives to help expand private green roof installation, we should be maximizing green roofs on publicly owned property, prioritizing those facilities that may either be facing higher carbon emissions and/or present opportunities for public engagement, especially of New York City youth. School buildings in particular are well-suited for green roofing, in part because many have large, flat roofs. School buildings also use a significant amount of energy, creating a lot of carbon emissions, and so they are ripe for improvements to their energy efficiency.

The federal government can help by instituting a Bucks for Boilers programsimilar to the old Cash for Clunkers vehicle programthat incentivizes building owners to swap out inefficient gas boilers with cleaner electric or geothermal units. However, a big move to electrify buildings could triple demand on the citys electrical system. New York will need to make major new investments to upgrade the transmission and distribution lines that bring clean electricity from other parts of the state into the city. Most important will be a dramatic increase in investment in renewable energy; above and beyond the states already ambitious plans.

Reaching 100 sites in the first year of a new administration could employ 100 full-time site coordinators, 1,200 annual NYCHA conservation corps members, and hundreds of contractors (with priority for resident entrepreneurs and those employing residents as part of their business models). Additionally, on-the-job training could be provided by specialists in carpentry, hydroponics, and horticulture.",,,,

,,,"Invest in community-driven, nature-based coastal resilience projects",,,,
,,,,,,,
,,,"With sea levels rising, New York City must support community-driven, nature-based solutions for coastal resilience. Rather than focusing on expensive offshore storm surge barriers, the city should construct onshore environmental infrastructure such as berms, living shorelines, salt marshes, and wetlands which provide cheaper, more adaptable, and less ecologically destructive protection against sea level rise. Projects such as stormwater retention gardens and salt marsh restorations have already been successfully completed in other northeastern cities like Boston. Native plants and trees that can survive both dry and flooded conditions should also be prioritized in coastal communities. A workforce tasked with plant stewardship can be responsible for the long term care of these plantings. In designing and executing these climate-smart projects, front-line communities should be central, especially historically disempowered and BIPOC communities.",,,,

,,,Invest in habitat restoration at the Hudson River Sanctuary,,,,
,,,,,,,
,,,"The 400-acre estuarine sanctuary in the waters off Hudson River Park needs critical investment to ensure the health of the tidal ecosystem and its diverse fish population. This investment could also create jobs for a workforce mobilized to construct oyster castles and textured surfaces arounds piers and bulkheads to develop oyster habitats. Oyster reefs are important for New York City and the lower Hudson estuary because oysters filter excessive nutrients from the water and provide three-dimensional habitat for a wide variety of fish species. Additionally, building salt marshes and cordgrass fields in bays along the Hudson would create additional fish spawning areas while also helping to lower excess nutrient levels in the water.",,,,

,,,Fast track construction of sewage and stormwater infrastructure,,,,
,,,,,,,
,,,"New York City discharges 21 billion gallons of sewage and stormwater into the harbor every year, and with climate change this number will grow. A public works program and climate corps could help fast-track the construction of large sewage and stormwater infrastructure projects that have already been planned. A sewage capture tunnel proposed for Newtown Creek would help prevent 1.3 billion gallons of discharge from contaminating the waterway per year. Additionally, moving forward with a plan for Rikers Island to convert 400-plus acres of land into a wastewater treatment facility and solar/energy farm would be a sound use of labor, provided we ensure that the project serves environmental justice goals and emphasizes community involvement.",,,,

,,,Support maintenance projects,,,,

,,,"The default progressive response to economic downturn is to invest in capital projects that can be advanced quickly and that address other contemporary policy prioritiestoday, resilience, climate adaptation, and equity. Virtually by definition, however, shovel-ready capital projects are those which have already been funded; directing stimulus funds to them replaces one source of funds with another. While New York City should certainly welcome any expansion of its investment capabilities, the shovel-ready projects for which there is no other source of funding, indeed for which there is vastly diminished funding, are maintenance projects.",,,,

,,,"I would prioritize restoration of parksdespite being, as always, the first operating budgets cut, parks have once again demonstrated their value as critical infrastructureand clean and efficient energy projects, including weatherization of homes and tune-up of building systems. But we should also support repair of major infrastructure, operating subsidies to strengthen regional food distribution and launch local agriculture, and a host of other maintenance projects that can be initiated within weeks of funding. These projects will all renew the aims of the Civilian Conservation Corps, this time ensuring that women and Black men get equitable access to jobs that are both less likely to be automated in the near term and offer career ladders.",,,,

,,,Invest in urban carbon farming,,,,
,,,,,,,
,,,"The city should invest in building up the health of the citys soil and encourage the development of green space with the goal of carbon sequestration. In partnership with community compost programs, the city can access locally produced compost made from New Yorkers food scraps. This model of collecting local organic waste and transforming it into a rich resource to be used on local soils represents a highly sustainable closed loop system. Communities across the city could play a role in sequestering carbon from the atmosphere, transforming pockets of green space into local carbon sponges. Furthermore, when carbon is stored in the soils it increases its ability to retain water and combat coastal flooding.",,,,

,,,"In the time of COVID-19, visitation to New York Citys natural areas has increased between 65 and 100 percent. With millions of New Yorkers flocking to the citys forested parkland for relief and recreation, protecting these forests and improving access is even more important. However, much of the citys forests is in a state of ecological decline due to threats including invasive species. They require ongoing management to ensure that they continue to mitigate climate change and provide a myriad of environmental benefits to New York City. Many natural areas are also in need of safe, well-marked trails that improve access while protecting the forests in times of increased use. The city should make a major investment in citywide forest management to ensure that the citys forest can achieve its full potential for recreation and conservation, and create opportunities for green jobs and environmental education.",,,,

,,,"New York City is projected to have six feet of sea level rise by 2100. The citys wetlands can play an important role as buffers from sea level rise and storms like Sandy, but these important wildlife areas require restoration and management to fulfill their resilience and buffering potential. We have located 120 potential wetland restoration opportunities spanning over 275 acres across the city. With large-scale, systematic investment in restoration and management across these sites, the city can ensure that wetlands provide crucial protection for coastal infrastructure and housing, while also ensuring access to the natural world and the social and public health benefits that come with spending time in nature.",,,,

,,,"Protecting the NYCHA Astoria Houses on Hallets Point in Astoria, Queens must be a priority for the city, and federal help can ensure the necessary infrastructure improvements happen. The campus esplanades seawall, waterfront railing, and walking path are in a dangerous state of disrepair, and there is concern that water is seeping through the foundation of the seawall underground and potentially damaging the structural integrity of the apartment buildings. The Parks Department is to commence repair of the waterfront railing later this month, but better coordination and collaboration between the Army Corps of Engineers, Department of Environmental Conservation, Parks Department, NYCHA, Astoria Houses residents, elected officials, and community partners is needed to create a big-picture plan going forward. Climate change will bring continued sea level rise, and conditions here are ill-prepared for this increase.",,,,
