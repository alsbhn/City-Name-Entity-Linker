Wealthy Manhattanites also have more resources and flexibility to escape, indefinitely, to greener pastures, like the Hamptons, experts say.\n\nThe city\u2019s ghost-town vibe has Shake Shack, which runs 162 restaurants in 20 states, reporting that its Big Apple stores will \u201ctake a longer period of time to fully recover than other parts of the country.\u201d\n\nThe burger chain made the statement on July 7 as it reported that NYC same-store sales for the week of July 1 had fallen 58 percent compared to a year earlier \u2014 the steepest decline among all its regions. Sales in the chain\u2019s Northeast and Southeast stores, by contrast, fell just 24 percent and 32 percent, respectively.\n\nWhile Shake Shack didn\u2019t mention Manhattan specifically, Zane Tankel, who owns 35 Applebee\u2019s in the New York metro area, told The Post he\u2019s reopened 18 restaurants in neighboring regions, including Brooklyn and Queens. But he sees no point in reopening his two Manhattan stores \u2014 not even for curbside pickup.\n\n\u201cI drive around the city all the time and it was an easy determination to see that there\u2019s not enough traffic to open those restaurants,\u201d said Tankel, CEO of Apple Metro. Prior to the pandemic, the Manhattan Applebee\u2019s, located at 205 W. 50th St. and at 234 W. 42nd St., were his most productive locations \u2014 representing $25 million in revenues.\n\nMacy\u2019s, whose Manhattan flagship occupies over 1 million square feet of retail space, is also concerned. Asked how its NYC stores, which reopened on June 22, are performing compared to the rest of the country, a spokeswoman said it\u2019s too soon to tell while also noting that \u201ccontinued work-from-home trends mean fewer commuters coming into the city,\u201d and that international and domestic tourism \u201cremains low.\u201d\n\nStarbucks also appears affected, said Mark Kalinowski, restaurant analyst and founder of Kalinowski Equity Research, who pointed to the Seattle coffee seller\u2019s June statement that just 5 percent of its company-operated US stores remained completely closed, even for takeout.\n\nThe bulk of the closed stores, Starbucks said, \u201care primarily located in the New York City metro area.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not normal to see Central Park and Times Square empty,\u201d Kalinowski explained.\n\nLawrence Berger, chairman of sports cap company Lids, said he\u2019s been floored by the drop in business at the chain\u2019s two best-performing New York stores \u2014 1501 Broadway and 2 Times Square \u2014 since they reopened on June 22.\n\nFoot traffic at those stores has been down 85 percent from a year ago \u2014 compared with a 20 percent average decline at Lids\u2019 900 other stores that have reopened across the country, said Berger, a partner of Ames Watson, which bought the 1,200-store chain last year.\n\nCustomer traffic at Lids stores in neighboring New Jersey and Pennsylvania, meanwhile, has actually increased 30 percent from a year ago, Berger added. And they all reopened at the same time.\n\n\u201cWe expected New York City to be like the rest of the country when we reopened our stores here, but it\u2019s a complete outlier,\u201d Berger said. \u201cThere is no way to make money.

Andrew Cuomo over the protections \u2013 issued a memo of opposition, arguing the pandemic is far from over and the healthcare system is still facing challenges.\n\n\u201cThe bill would prospectively remove protections for non-COVID-19 patients whose care would be affected by the response to another COVID-19 surge. This includes hospitals\u2019 response to State orders by discharging patients early to prepare for a surge; deploying volunteers, staff, and medical students to alleviate severe staff shortages; expedited triage of emergency room patients to make room for an influx of COVID-19 patients; and the conversion of existing and creation of new hospital spaces to care for patients,\u201d GNYHA spokesman Brian Conway said.

Jay Inslee of Washington state proposed a statewide public health insurance option available to anyone who is not covered by an employer.\n\nThe prospects for a statewide universal health care proposal in New York improved last fall when Democrats took control of the entire Legislature by winning a Senate majority. But while many liberal members of the Senate and Assembly say they favor an expansion of state-run health care, finding the money to pay for such a program would be challenging.

It's now prohibiting businesses from adding the supplement to food or drink.\n\n\"The Health Department takes seriously its responsibility to protect New Yorkers' health,\" a spokeswoman said in an email to CNBC. \"Until cannabidiol (CBD) is deemed safe as a food additive, the Department is ordering restaurants not to offer products containing CBD.\"\n\nMost CBD was legalized in December when President Donald Trump signed the farm bill. Industry insiders and analysts expected this to fuel an already growing market. However, the Food and Drug Administration's ban on adding CBD to foods and drinks was seen as a possible hurdle.\n\nThe FDA prohibits companies from adding active ingredients that are drug products in foods and drinks. CBD falls into this category because it's the main ingredient in Epidiolex, a drug the FDA approved last year to treat severe childhood epilepsy.\n\nWhen Trump signed the farm bill, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb released a statement saying the agency would continue enforcing a ban on adding CBD to food and drinks while it looked into creating a pathway for such products to legally enter the market.\n\nThe New York City health department started embargoing CBD products in January.

EWA and EPA's recommendations diverge both on the recommended level of contaminants and the number of contaminants for which state agencies should be held accountable.\n\nThe EPA did not respond to numerous requests by Patch seeking comment on the findings of the study, which argues its regulatory system is \"broken.\"\n\n\"The inexcusable failure of the federal government's responsibility to protect public health means there are no legal limits for more than 160 unregulated contaminants in U.S. tap water,\" Environmental Working Group researchers stated in its \"State of American Drinking Water.\"\n\nA focal point of the organization's concern is that Environmental Protection Agency has not added a new contaminant to its list of toxic chemicals list covered by the Safe Drinking Water Act in almost 20 years.\n\nIn the case of polyfluorinated substances, or PFAs, the environmental group estimated up to 110 million Americans could have the potentially cancer-causing, immune-system damaging contaminant in their drinking water. Yet the EPA requires drinking water utilities across the country to test for only six of 14 known substances in the category.\n\n\n\nIndependent experts share the group's concerns.\n\n\"With the science on what we call 'emerging contaminants' continuing to grow, it is clear that there are components of our tap water that can be improved,\" Kristin Strock, professor of Environmental Science at Dickinson College, told Patch.\n\nStrock, who is not affiliated with the environmental group, also emphasized the challenges in the process of federally regulating harmful contaminants, suggesting the current system is somewhat backward.\n\n\"The road to regulating harmful contaminants is difficult, as our current construct for ensuring clean water is based on 'proving' that something is harmful before it is regulated as opposed to assuming contaminants could be harmful and 'proving' them safe before allowing them to go into industrial production and, as a result, our environment,\" she said. \"The EPA has been working on identifying safe limits for a number of these emerging contaminants and continues to work on the problem.\"\n\nEWA recommends New Yorkers concerned about water contaminants invest in filtering technologies, such as carbon filters, that reduce many, but not all, contaminants.\n\nBut Olga Naidenko, vice president of science investigation at the group, argued the responsibility of purifying water should not fall on those who drink tap water, but rather those who contaminate it.\n\n\"Industries and companies that released PFAS into the environment and drinking water sources \u2014 should be responsible to covering such costs,\" Naidenko said. \"It is unfair for homeowners to be saddled with costs for pollution they did not create.\"\n\nMore detailed information on the organization's funding and annual reports are available on its website.\n\nPatch editors Gus Saltonstall and Dan Hampton contributed to this report.", "title": "Cancer-Linked Contaminants Found In NYC Drinking Water: Study", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['New York']"}, {"id": 17, "city": "New York", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/20/nyregion/heat-wave-nyc.html", "text": "[Read our latest updates on the heat wave.]\n\nAlberto Reyes fumed.

Staffers came prepared with hard hats and yellow vests for us visitors.\n\nLees ook op Business Insider Huiseigenaren hebben haast: huizen in alle provincies sneller verkocht\u2026voordat prijzen mogelijk gaan dalen\n\nFoto: sourceAria Bendix/Business Insider\n\nThe plant recently underwent a $5 billion renovation and expansion, so it looks shiny and new.\n\nFoto: sourceAria Bendix/Business Insider\n\nThe Newtown Creek plant was originally built in 1967. Nearly three decades later, the city announced plans to expand the facility and make upgrades to comply with the US Clean Water Act, which requires at least 85% of pollutants to be removed from wastewater before it can be discharged into local waterways.\n\nAt the time, neighbors were opposed to the expansion because they had grown tired of the rotten egg smell (which no longer exists).\n\nThe designers opted for materials that make the building stand out \u2014 a notable difference from most wastewater-treatment plants.\n\nFoto: sourceAria Bendix/Business Insider\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to hide a 110-foot-tall building,\u201d Richard Olcott, one of the plant\u2019s designers, told the Ornamental Metal Institute of New York. \u201cSo, rather than hiding it, we thought we should do the opposite: We should really show the thing off and make something everyone would look at and go, \u2018Wow! What\u2019s that?'\u201d\n\nThe fist thing you see when you walk through the gates is the plant\u2019s massive pipe system, which controls for odors.\n\nFoto: sourceAria Bendix/Business Insider\n\nThe plant usually accepts 250 million gallons of wastewater each day from toilets, sinks, and storm drains.\n\nFoto: sourceAria Bendix/Business Insider\n\nAfter wastewater travels through sewers to the treatment plant, it passes through screens that remove large chunks of garbage like bottles, rags, newspapers, and plastic cups. Pam Elardo, New York\u2019s deputy commissioner of wastewater treatment, said one the most common forms of trash is baby or facial wipes that claim to be flushable but aren\u2019t.\n\nAll that trash is then sent to a landfill.\n\nFrom there, wastewater travels to sedimentation tanks, where heavier solids (like poop) sink to the bottom. Lighter particles, including grease and small bits of plastic, float to the top.\n\nFoto: sourceAria Bendix/Business Insider\n\nThis separation makes the top particles easy to remove. The bottom ones \u2013 the \u201csludge\u201d \u2013 are sent to a device that spins them rapidly. The centrifugal force helps sift out tiny particles like coffee grinds from the bulk of the waste.\n\nThe sludge then moves to large \u201cbubbling tanks,\u201d where it\u2019s mixed with air. The process encourages oxygen-using bacteria to feed on pollutants in the water.\n\nFoto: sourceAria Bendix/Business Insider\n\nAfter about three to six hours, the mixture moves to \u201csettling tanks,\u201d where heavy particles are further sifted out. Some return to the \u201cbubbling tanks\u201d to help stimulate the growth of more good bacteria that feeds on pollutants.\n\nOnce the treated water is ready to be disinfected, it goes to tanks containing sodium hypochlorite, a chemical found in bleach, for about 15 to 20 minutes. Then the water is discharged into local waterways.\n\nBut some sludge remains even after this long treatment process. Those particles are thickened and sent to \u201cdigester eggs.\u201d\n\nFoto: sourceAria Bendix/Business Insider\n\nThe eggs are clad in stainless steel and light up at night. There are eight of them at the facility.\n\nWhen the sludge arrives, it gets heated to around 95 degrees Fahrenheit in an oxygen-free environment, where it remains for 15 to 20 days. This creates more good bacteria that breaks down the sludge into water, carbon dioxide, and methane gas.\n\nThe egg shape helps conserve energy for churning waste.\n\nOur tour group took an elevator to the top of these \u201cdigester eggs.\u201d\n\nFoto: sourceAria Bendix/Business Insider\n\nThe eggs are connected by a set of glass walkways 110 feet in the air.\n\nFoto: sourceAria Bendix/Business Insider\n\nThe walkways are lined with sturdy guardrails. At each intersection, you can see some of the equipment used to control the \u201cdigestion\u201d process.\n\nFoto: sourceAria Bendix/Business Insider\n\nMost of the tour was odor-free, but there was certainly an unpleasant stench near the digesters.\n\nFoto: sourceAria Bendix/Business Insider\n\nI understand why Greenpoint residents used to complain about the rotten-egg smell.\n\nIf you look closely, you can see what\u2019s happening inside the digesters.\n\nFoto: sourceAria Bendix/Business Insider\n\nWe didn\u2019t get to see the sludge up close, but were told it\u2019s black in color and has the consistency of pea soup.\n\nFoto: sourceAria Bendix/Business Insider\n\nAfter up to 20 days, the sludge is moved from the eggs to storage tanks.\n\nFoto: sourceAria Bendix/Business Insider\n\nEventually, it gets transferred from a storage tank to a \u201csludge boat\u201d that takes the waste to another plant in the Bronx. That plant removes liquid from the sludge, forming it into a \u201ccake\u201d that can be used as fertilizer.\n\nFoto: sourceAria Bendix/Business Insider\n\nBy the end of the tour, the elevators had temporarily stopped working. (The staff had warned us earlier that the elevators were fickle.) So we exited down 11 flights of stairs.\n\nFoto: sourceAria Bendix/Business Insider\n\nBack on the ground, the guides explained that the facility is exploring more uses for its byproducts. For example, the plant is working on a pilot program to collect food waste, add it to the digester eggs, and produce methane gas that could power local homes.\n\nFoto: sourceAria Bendix/Business Insider\n\nBut there are still some issues to sort out: Elardo said that although New York City\u2019s water quality is the best it has been in 100 years, facilities like Newtown Creek still don\u2019t filter for every known contaminant.\n\nFoto: sourceAria Bendix/Business Insider\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re designed to take human waste and industrial waste and make it clean,\u201d Elardo said. \u201cThere are a lot of exotic things that come our way that we shouldn\u2019t necessarily be spending a lot of time, energy, and money treating.\u201d\n\nTurning the wastewater from sewage pipes into \u201c100% H2O\u201d could cost \u201chundreds of billions of dollars,\u201d she added.\n\nThat means microplastics \u2014 tiny bits of plastic less than 5 millimeters long \u2014 can linger in the treated water that enters local waterways.\n\nFoto: sourceAria Bendix/Business Insider\n\nThe best way to treat microplastics, Elardo said, would be to cut them off at the source \u2013 the way the city already does with silver from dental facilities.\n\n\u201cIn the old days, we got tons of silver in our system that actually contaminated the biosolids. There was a huge national program to make dentists pull the silver out at their offices,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the kind of source control I\u2019m talking about \u2013 either treat it at the source or eliminate the product.\u201d\n\nBy the end of my visit, I was struck by how the facility combines such a practical mission \u2014 cleaning people\u2019s poop \u2014 with stunning design elements.\n\nFoto: sourceAria Bendix/Business Insider\n\nWhenever I do the dishes or flush the toilet at home, I\u2019ll think of my water\u2019s journey toward those giant steel eggs.", "title": "I toured New York City\u2019s largest wastewater-treatment plant, which collects poop from 1 million people.

Buildings of this size make up less than 2 percent of the city\u2019s real estate, but account for roughly half of its energy use, and thus the city\u2019s share of carbon emissions.\n\nThat\u2019s made them a target of previous city building energy and carbon emissions efforts. New York City has already instituted building standards, known as the Greener, Greater Buildings Plan, that include a series of efficiency and data-collection requirements for buildings of this size, including annual benchmarking of their electricity and water consumption, periodic energy audits and retro-commissioning, and a requirement to undergo lighting and sub-metering upgrades by 2025.\n\nBut the new law would be the first of any city in the country to set specific emissions limits on large buildings, coupled with financial penalties for failing to comply, imposed through the newly created Office of Building Energy Performance.\n\nProperty owners have complained that the bill\u2019s exemptions \u2014 it excludes houses of worship, rent-regulated apartments and low-income housing, and other categories of buildings \u2014 will leave too much burden on the remaining building owners to cut energy usage.\n\nBut the bill\u2019s backers say it\u2019s an important first step toward tackling a massive challenge for any city or state seeking to reduce their carbon emissions from the built environment. Buildings make up about 40 percent of U.S. energy consumption, according to the Energy Information Administration.\n\nRetrofits, carbon trading on the table\n\nNew York state is engaged in its own \"Green New Deal\" push to reduce fossil fuel consumption and attain a zero-carbon energy mix by 2040, which will help the city\u2019s biggest buildings meet their goals by reducing the carbon intensity of the electricity they use.\n\nIn the meantime, however, while most buildings don\u2019t have much control over the carbon profile of the electricity they consume beyond installing solar panels or other clean generation, making them more efficient with the energy they do use will be a critical piece of any broader carbon-reduction scheme.\n\n\"Buildings will have to do deep energy retrofits, buy green power or eventually look at carbon trading,\u201d John Mandyck, CEO of the Urban Green Council, a backer of the legislation, told Crain\u2019s New York Business. \u201cWe get that it's tough and that billions of dollars will need to be spent to reduce carbon emissions. But new technology and new business models will be invented to help buildings get there.\"\n\nOther bills that make up the Climate Mobilization Act package include a property-assessed clean energy financing program to help find renewable energy or building energy efficiency improvements.\n\nIt also includes a bill that would direct the city to study whether it could close 21 natural-gas-fired power plants within its borders and replace them with renewable energy and energy storage, and a bill to require certain buildings to cover their roofs in solar panels, small wind turbines or \u201cgreen roof\u201d gardens.", "title": "New York City Set to Pass Ambitious Energy Efficiency Mandate", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['New York']"}, {"id": 21, "city": "New York", "url": "https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/6/20/18691058/new-york-green-new-deal-climate-change-cuomo", "text": "Update, July 22: Gov. Andrew Cuomo has signed the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act into law. Our explainer, first published June 20, follows:\n\nNew York is the fourth most populous state in the US and its third-largest economy. Now it is poised to adopt the country\u2019s most ambitious climate targets, including 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2040 and economy-wide, net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.\n\nOn Tuesday night, the state Senate passed the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, and on Wednesday night, the state Assembly passed it. All it requires now is a signature from Gov. Andrew Cuomo.\n\nThis is a big deal.\n\nIn passing bold climate legislation, New York will follow in the footsteps of Maine, Oregon, Washington, Colorado, New Mexico, California, and New Jersey, all of which have passed substantive clean energy policies in the past year or so. (Hawaii has had its 100 percent renewables target in place since 2015.)\n\nAnd New York accomplished this feat the exact same way all those other states did it: by electing overwhelming Democratic majorities.\n\nFor years, the state Assembly has been under the control of Democrats, but in the Senate, the Independent Democratic Conference (IDC), a small group of conservative Democrats, caucused with Republicans, effectively giving Republicans control. Cuomo accepted and even encouraged this state of affairs, as it gave him tremendous personal power and infuriated his Democratic critics.\n\nSo for four years in a row, a broad coalition pushed the Climate and Community Protection Act (CCPA) through the assembly only to have it die in the Senate.\n\nHowever, in the 2018 elections, the IDC got crushed, Cuomo got scared to the left by a challenge from Cynthia Nixon, and Democrats finally got the dual majorities they needed, which they immediately put to use with measures on voting rights, abortion, and protections for renters.\n\nLast year, Cuomo put forward his own climate bill, the Climate Leadership Act, which he referred to as a Green New Deal for New York, annoying pretty much everyone. That bill contained electricity carbon goals but no economy-wide carbon goals, and nothing at all on equity.\n\nBut activists kept pushing (recently, a broad group of scholars intervened to help them), and finally, late on Wednesday night, the very last day of the legislative session, the bill was passed. (Cuomo is expected to sign it this week.) Miracles are real!\n\nSo what\u2019s in it?\n\nThe bill that passed \u2014 renamed, for reasons no one can quite explain, the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA) \u2014 is closer to the old CCPA than it is to the governor\u2019s bill, but it has a few key changes and amendments, which we\u2019ll get into below.\n\nAltogether, the final product represents an enormous victory for New York\u2019s climate advocacy community, especially in the face of Cuomo\u2019s long record of ... unhelpfulness. Let\u2019s have a look.\n\n100 percent, economy-wide net-zero carbon emissions by 2050\n\nOriginally, the CCPA targeted zero carbon emissions, economy-wide, by 2050. After the compromise, the CLCPA now targets net zero by 2050. (With an interim target: 40 percent reductions from 1990 emissions by 2030.)\n\nThe difference between \u201czero\u201d and \u201cnet zero\u201d is that only 85 percent of the reductions must come from New York\u2019s own energy and industrial emissions; the remaining 15 percent can come from carbon offsets (e.g., from forestry or agriculture).\n\nActivists are not thrilled with this, but it was arguably a necessary concession. There\u2019s a case to be made that the state simply doesn\u2019t have the statutory authority necessary to get to zero \u2014 there will inevitably be some hard-to-reach emissions, outside state authority, that require offsetting. Offsets also create an income stream for good forestry and ag practices.\n\nThe bill contains a number of provisions meant to avoid some of the negative effects offsets have had in other programs.\n\nStationary electric sources \u2014 power plants \u2014 cannot avail themselves of offsets. They are often located in disadvantaged communities, and anyway, it is well understood how to eliminate their emissions.\n\nOffsets are reserved for facilities or processes where the technology for full elimination of carbon is not yet commercially available (think, for example, cement mixing). For those facilities, there will be a review every four years to ensure that they are using the best available technology (BAT) for reducing emissions before purchasing offsets.\n\nAll offsets must come from within 25 miles of the purchaser, to ensure that the benefits stay within local communities. Offset projects must benefit the local environment and, where possible, reduce co-pollutants. Biofuels and waste-to-energy projects are prohibited.\n\nNevertheless, put aside that last 15 percent. Just getting to 85 percent carbon-free will be an enormous lift for an industrialized economy like New York\u2019s. This is the most stringent economy-wide carbon target in the US, in one of the most challenging states. It\u2019s a new benchmark.\n\nThe plan to reduce emissions will be made by a council\n\nRather than specifying the mechanisms by which emissions will be reduced, the legislature set up a process to create a scoping plan, led by a 22-member Climate Action Council. The council will be composed of the heads of various New York state agencies, along with members appointed by the governor, the Senate, and the Assembly. (This is somewhat similar to how California handed over the policy details to its Air Resources Board.)\n\nThe council will convene advisory panels on various specific subjects (transportation, land use and local government, industry, etc.) and consult them in developing the scoping plan. It will also convene a just-transition working group to research and advise on workforce training, job impacts, and related matters. And it will consult with the climate justice working group. (That working group is created elsewhere in the bill; it will contain representatives from disadvantaged communities and environmental justice groups, as well as representatives from trade-exposed industries.)\n\nPart of the council\u2019s challenge will be integrating and building on all of the state\u2019s existing climate and clean energy programs. The Natural Resources Defense Council cites \u201cthe Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) to cap and cut carbon pollution from power plants; the $1 billion NY-Sun program to scale up solar power; ChargeNY, EVolve NY, and the Drive Clean Rebate to expand electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure statewide and get more EVs on the road; the state\u2019s initiative to deploy 3,000 megawatts of battery storage by 2030; and a successful Clean Energy Standard to expand renewable energy penetration.\u201d\n\nStitching all that together will take some doing, and the mandate is wide open. The council could suggest a carbon pricing system (to supplement or enhance RGGI), a variety of regulations, or, like most states, a mix. There are a few parameters: Emission reductions must be real and verifiable; they must be distributed equitably; they must not increase emissions of \u201cco-pollutants\u201d; and they must minimize so-called \u201cleakage,\u201d whereby emitting facilities simply relocate outside the state.\n\nEvery four years, the council will issue a comprehensive report on state greenhouse gas emissions and progress, and adjust its plan as needed. (The state will also integrate a social cost of carbon into all agency decisions.)\n\n100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2040\n\nThose who understand deep decarbonization understand that the electricity sector is key to the process. It is both the easiest sector to decarbonize and a means through which to decarbonize the others. (Electrify everything!)\n\nThe electricity targets in the bill actually got strengthened in the final compromise. Whereas the CCPA targeted 50 percent renewables by 2030, the CLCPA targets 70 percent renewable electricity by 2030 and 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2040. (The mechanism for this will be the state\u2019s renewable portfolio standard, administered by the Public Service Commission.)\n\nNew York now joins California, Nevada, Hawaii, Washington, New Mexico, Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico in targeting 100 percent clean power.\n\nAlso, just for kicks, the bill targets 9,000 MW of offshore wind energy by 2035, 6,000 MW of solar energy by 2025, and a 23 percent increase in energy efficiency.\n\nA third of the benefits go to frontline communities\n\nOriginally, the CCPA stipulated that 40 percent of all state investments in climate and clean energy go to \u201cdisadvantaged communities\u201d \u2014 those most vulnerable to the effects of climate change or most threatened by the transition away from fossil fuels.\n\nNow, after some backroom wrangling, the language has become slightly more opaque. Here\u2019s the relevant section of the CLCPA (just to give you a flavor of what I\u2019ve been squinting at all day):\n\nState agencies, authorities and entities, in consultation with the environmental justice working group and the climate action council, shall, to the extent practicable, invest or direct available and relevant programmatic resources in a manner designed to achieve a goal for disadvantaged communities to receive forty percent of overall benefits of spending on clean energy and energy efficiency programs, projects or investments in the areas of housing, workforce development, pollution reduction, low income energy assistance, energy, transportation and economic development, provided however, that disadvantaged communities shall receive no less than thirty-five percent of the overall benefits of spending on clean energy and energy efficiency programs, projects or investments and provided further that this section shall not alter funds already contracted or committed as of the effective date of this section.\n\nIsn\u2019t legislation fun to read?\n\nAnyway, \u201c40 percent of the investments\u201d has become \u201cprobably 40 percent, but no less than 35 percent, of the benefits of the investments.\u201d That\u2019s a bit fuzzier, which is aggravating to the environmental justice community. \u201cFrontline communities need more than a vague commitment for benefits,\u201d Annel Hernandez of the NYC Environmental Justice Alliance told me. \u201cWe need direct investments to catalyze our transition to the clean renewable energy economy.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not yet clear how \u201cdisadvantaged communities\u201d will be defined for the purposes of the bill (the climate justice working group will develop criteria, drawing on data from community air-monitoring systems). And it\u2019s not yet clear how \u201cbenefits of the investments\u201d will be defined. That\u2019s likely going to mean an annual push-pull battle between activists and state regulators.\n\nStill, it\u2019s worth taking a step back and noting what a huge commitment this is. In California and Oregon, 40 percent of the revenue from cap and trade is set aside for disadvantaged communities, but that\u2019s a single pot of money. New York\u2019s bill ensures that 40 percent (or, ahem, no less than 35 percent) of all state climate and clean energy spending \u2014 funds from RGGI, the state\u2019s Clean Energy Fund, any future initiatives established by this program \u2014 goes to disadvantaged communities.\n\nThat\u2019s potentially many billions of dollars, spread across a range of agencies and programs. It could be a huge engine for lifting up vulnerable communities across the state.\n\nThe bill got somewhat screwed on job quality provisions\n\nThe bill originally contained a number of provisions meant to ensure that the state creates high-quality jobs, including measures on prevailing wages, apprenticeship programs, preferences for women- and minority-owned businesses, and more.\n\nAll of it got stripped out, because elsewhere in the legislature, a different deal was being hammered out, which would have put in place wage and job standards across all state government programs, not just the clean energy ones.\n\nLong story short, at the last minute, that deal fell apart. All that\u2019s left in the CLCPA? \u201cThe Act shall be subject to current prevailing wage law.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s kind of thin gruel, especially for the unions that showed up to support the bill: Service Employees International Union 32BJ, New York State Nurses (NYSNA), the Teamsters, and others.\n\nBut the broad coalition that has come together over the years behind this bill \u2014 NY Renews now boasts more than 180 members, from unions to community groups to state and national environmental groups \u2014 is not finished. It plans to continue pushing for job quality measures. And it\u2019s also thinking longer term, about further measures, including something like a tax-and-invest system (like Oregon\u2019s). The struggle will continue.\n\nWhy this is a very big deal\n\nAdvocates didn\u2019t get everything they wanted, but in the big picture, the CLCPA is a huge, huge win. The country\u2019s third-biggest economy has passed its most ambitious economy-wide climate targets \u2014 some of the most ambitious climate targets in the world. And hitting those targets will generate ongoing waves of investment into the state\u2019s worst-off communities.\n\nIt is a win for the state\u2019s economy, which will see a boom in innovation and investment. It\u2019s a win for environmental justice, shifting state funding to those most vulnerable. And it\u2019s a win for the climate.\n\nWhat remains to be seen are the longer-term reverberations this recent flurry of state action will produce. As of now, two of the nation\u2019s three biggest state economies \u2014 the West Coast\u2019s biggest and the East Coast\u2019s biggest \u2014 are heading for carbon neutrality by midcentury. In between them, a patchwork of climate-forward states is forming.\n\nRight now, it\u2019s happening all and only where Democrats take overwhelming power. But at a certain point, the size of the market for zero-carbon technologies, and the investment that market attracts, will grow so large that other states will jump on board so they aren\u2019t left behind. Companies are not going to want to make two versions of all their products, a dirty version and a clean version. They will want standards harmonized, and standards tend to get harmonized upward, as California has shown again and again.\n\nThis is what climate victory, if there is any such thing, is going to look like in the US. It\u2019s not going to happen through persuasion, whereby the fossil fuel industry realizes the error of its ways and releases federal politicians from its grip. The Green New Deal is probably not going to be built in one grand spasm of federal action. Rather, if it happens at all, it will be through grinding out victories where Democrats control things \u2014 some states and lots and lots of cities \u2014 until economic and social tipping points are reached.\n\nNo one knows exactly when that might happen. But there\u2019s no doubt that New York has just accelerated the schedule.", "title": "New York just passed the most ambitious climate target in the country", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['New York']"}, {"id": 22, "city": "New York", "url": "https://www.nationalobserver.com/2019/04/23/news/new-york-citys-green-new-deal-music-quebecs-ears", "text": "New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's Green New Deal is music to the ears of Quebec Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault\u200f.

The utility has offered financing totalling roughly $40 million for a proposed 9.45 TWh transmission line to Massachusetts. But another proposed line to New York City would bring 8.3 TWh into the city's electric region, and is getting renewed attention thanks to de Blasio's announcement. \"We are looking forward to sitting down with members of Mayor de Blasio\u2019s team in the near future to negotiate contract terms,\" said Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec strategic communications advisor Lynn St. Laurent in an email to National Observer. \"Many items need to be addressed. Long-term contracts take time to negotiate.\" St. Laurent said Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec considered de Blasio's timeline of a deal by 2020 to be \"feasible\" and \"negotiations should begin shortly.\" The utility sees the upcoming steps as \"very positive,\" she said. \"Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec welcomes Mayor de Blasio\u2019s commitment to pursuing a formal procurement and we are looking forward to discussions with the City of New York.\" The plan by de Blasio, who is rumoured to be considering a U.S. presidential run in 2020, would create clean economy jobs and cut the city\u2019s carbon pollution. By using the Green New Deal title, he is referencing an international movement to tie job growth with climate action that has been recently championed by many environment groups, particularly youth-based.

Julien welcomed the announcement in a statement, saying the decision by New York City \"demonstrates the undeniable attractiveness of Quebec's renewable and clean electricity to our neighbours in terms of reducing their carbon footprint.\" The Champlain Hudson Power Express (CHPE), the proposed transmission line to the Big Apple, would have a \"cumulative market value of $19.9 billion in the first 30 years of operation\" according to a 2017 analysis commissioned by the proponent.\n\nIt would also \"reduce CO2 emissions attributed to the State of New York by over 100 million metric tons,\" the analysis stated. Albany-based Transmission Developers Inc. (TDI) has been looking to lock down contracts so it can sell capacity on the CHPE line in order to help finance the project. It would run two cables underground, and underwater through Lake Champlain and along the Hudson and other rivers. While it was previously delayed over route changes, construction is now expected to start next year, National Observer has reported. TDI and the Blackstone Group, the Manhattan investment firm that is providing equity funding, said in a joint statement reacting to the mayor\u2019s announcement that the CHPE was \"fully permitted\" and \"ready to supply New York with 1,000 MW of clean, renewable power.\" \"We look forward to working with the city and state during the formal procurement process and to being a part of New York's cleaner, greener future,\" the companies said, adding the project \u201cwill create jobs, improve local air quality and more than double the amount of carbon-free power in New York City's energy supply.\" Spokesman John Lacey said the firms would not be commenting further beyond their statement.

CHPE is one example of how this could be done, the utility has said. The New York City plan may also be good for the Apuiat Wind Project, a 200 megawatt, 50-turbine project partially on the Innu Takuaikan Uashat Mak Mani-Utenam First Nation on Quebec's north shore, near Port-Cartier. The $600-million project was criticized by Legault while running for premier. However on Tuesday, Julien, the provincial energy minister, said Apuiat would be the next Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec project, and that it \"will take place\" as soon as the surpluses begin to be drawn down. Legault has also pitched his power export plan to Ontario Premier Doug Ford. The Quebec premier said in November that he had offered to sell hydroelectricity to Ontario at cheaper rates than it would cost for Ontario to refurbish its aging fleet of nuclear reactors. In December at a Montreal meeting of premiers, along with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, National Observer reported that Legault continuously brought the focus back to Quebec\u2019s surplus of hydroelectricity. St. Laurent said Quebec sent 6.8 TWh of energy to Ontario in 2018, and still has available transmission capacity between the Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec system and Ontario\u2019s. The province currently has a contract through 2023 for up to two TWh annually.

The original goal set in 2004 aimed to generate 25% of the state\u2019s electrical energy from renewable sources by 2013, an increase from the 19.3% the state produced in 2004. (The vast majority of New York\u2019s existing renewable energy production is hydropower, but there is limited potential for growth in hydro.) In 2010, the state upped that goal to produce 30% of electrical energy from renewable sources. The state came close in 2013 with about 23% renewable energy, but fell well short in 2015 when it was still stuck at 23%. According to the most recent New York State Independent System Operator Power Trends report, today, the state only produces about 26% of its electricity from renewable sources, meaning that it had still not quite hit the 2015 goal.\n\nAlthough the 2004 and 2010 laws predate Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s tenure, their lack of successful implementation illustrates the potential pitfalls of the state\u2019s hopes to transform its power sector.\n\nAfter the Renewable Portfolio Standard, Cuomo introduced the state\u2019s current program, the Clean Energy Standard. It set a goal of creating 50% of the state\u2019s electricity by 2030. Cuomo proposed upping that target to 70%, a goal that was written into the new climate law as well and will soon be codified. The state\u2019s slow rate of renewable energy growth had already put into question the feasibility of hitting the original 50% goal, and makes the 70% goal appear impossible without dramatic growth of solar and wind energy deployment. Over the course of Cuomo\u2019s tenure so far, the state increased its renewable energy by less than 10% \u2013 in 2011, when he took office, the state was at 19% renewable.\n\nThe Clean Energy Standard is a part of Cuomo\u2019s larger Reforming the Energy Vision initiative, which includes energy production targets: 2,400 megawatts offshore wind by 2030, 1,500 megawatts of storage by 2025 and 3 gigawatts of solar by 2023. Cuomo increased those targets this year, creating new goals of 9,000 megawatts of offshore wind by 2035, increasing distributed solar deployment to 6,000 megawatts by 2025 and 3,000 megawatts of storage by 2030. Currently, the state has 8,480 megawatts of proposed solar energy, with only 1,809 megawatts currently available. New York also has 4,036 megawatts in proposed storage, but only 56 megawatts right now. (The ability to store energy so that solar or wind energy can still be used when the sun is not shining or the wind is not blowing is essential to achieving an all-renewable energy sector.) The state also produces no offshore wind energy, but produces 1,985 megawatts of energy from land-based wind farms. The state took a large step forward in meeting the energy-procurement goals with $1.4 billion awarded to 26 large-scale renewable energy projects in 2018, including 22 solar farms.\n\nThe state has had difficulty increasing its wind energy output, which has remained largely stagnant over the past several years, due in part to what developers consider a burdensome approval process. Many concerns revolve around the aesthetic of wind turbines and local habitat preservation. New York has so far procured only 90 megawatts of offshore wind, approved in 2017. The project has since been expanded to 130 megawatts and is expected to begin construction in 2021, although it still awaits final federal approval. The state was set to announce in spring a second procurement of up to 1,200 megawatts after receiving several bids in February of this year, but that announcement has been delayed and has no dates as to when those projects may begin or be completed.\n\nThe newly passed Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act also includes a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 85% from 1990 levels by 2050 across all economic sectors, but the state has theoretically been working to reduce emissions 80% by the same year since 2009. That year, then-Gov. David Paterson signed an executive order creating the target, as well as a Climate Action Council to create a plan to reach it. Peter Iwanowicz, executive director of Environmental Advocates of New York, said that after Cuomo took over in 2011, that plan fell by the wayside.\n\nIn 2015, Cuomo signed his own executive order reaffirming to 80% reduction of emissions by 2050, with a milestone of 40% reduction by 2030. Both were cornerstones of his Clean Energy Standard and Reforming the Energy Vision established the same year. In 2018, the state released a greenhouse gas inventory: in 2015, New York had only reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 8% below 1990 levels.\n\nWhile much of the more public efforts have been around the renewable energy goals, Reforming the Energy Vision includes a number of other projects that would help to address the broader emission goals, such as making buildings more energy efficient and decreasing the reliance on fossil fuels in the transportation sector. For example, the state has been working to expand its network of electric vehicle charging stations to encourage more consumers to use electric or hybrid cars, which will be key if New York aims to reduce overall carbon emissions 85%. There was a goal set for 3,000 electric vehicle charging stations across the state by 2018. As of 2017, the last year data for which data is available, the state created 700 new stations thanks to projects awards in 2012 and 2013, bringing the total number of charging stations to 1,700.\n\nIn 2018, the governor announced a $4.2 million investment to achieve a new goal to have 10,000 electric vehicle charging stations by 2021 in order to support the 850,000 electric vehicles the Cuomo would like the state to have by 2025 and 2 million by 2030. The state had about 37,000 electric vehicles on the road in 2018.\n\nJulie Tighe, president of the League of Conservation Voters, acknowledged that certain projects are not moving as quickly as many advocates would like, but she feels confident that as the state continues to dedicate more time and money to getting those projects done, they will be able to get off the ground quicker. \u201cThere is no question that there is a pathway to achieving these goals within the timeline that has been proposed, or the governor wouldn\u2019t have proposed them in the first place,\u201d Tighe said. She added that the advancements will likely come in big jumps, rather than a smooth line.\n\nIwanowicz was not quite as optimistic. He said that, overall, the state has not done well in meeting its environmental and climate-related goals, from energy procurement to emissions reductions, in large part because action has almost exclusively come from executive orders rather than through laws in collaboration with the state Legislature. \u201cYou look at Rhode Island, they lead the nation in per capita energy efficiency. It's because their legislature\u2019s involved in the process,\u201d Iwanowicz said. \u201cYou're seeing the success of that shared responsibility.\u201d\n\nIwanowicz said that he and other members of the coalition group New York Renews have never been confident that goals set in executive orders will ultimately be met, and that they need the power of law, and consequences for inaction, in order to happen. That was why the group has long been pushing the Climate and Community Protection Act, which evolved and changed names slightly when it passed. \u201cThe law really has to be aggressively watchdogged, implemented, and then enforced, so that we do hit the 70% (renewable energy goal). But the pathway is clear,\u201d Iwanowicz said.\n\nUPDATE: This article has been updated to reflect newer and more comprehensive solar deployment and energy storage figures.", "title": "Can New York hit its environmental goals?", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "[]"}, {"id": 24, "city": "New York", "url": "https://altamontenterprise.com/08222019/will-new-york-produce-enough-renewable-energy-time-meet-its-deadlines", "text": "NEW SCOTLAND \u2014 With the signing into law of the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act last month, New York out-California\u2019ed the Golden State by approving a \u201chistoric\u201d and \u201clandmark\u201d piece of legislation that has been hailed not only as the most \u201caggressive,\u201d \u201cprogressive,\u201d and \u201cambitious\u201d climate plan in the country but also the world.\n\nThe new law requires the state to cut its greenhouse-gas emissions 85 percent by 2050. No small feat considering that, according to the most recent available data, New York State between 1990 and 2016 had reduced carbon emissions by just 13.5 percent.\n\nAnd, if that weren\u2019t enough, the state\u2019s Clean Energy Standard says that, by 2030, seventy percent of New York\u2019s electricity has to come from renewable energy sources. By 2040, the new law says, the state\u2019s electricity sector is to be \u201c100-percent carbon-free.\u201d\n\nWith its Clean Energy Standard, New York joins California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Washington, as states that, by statute, will have 100 percent of electricity generation from carbon-free sources by the middle of the century.\n\nNew York State currently gets around 60 percent of its electricity from carbon-free sources; about one-third comes from nuclear power and about 30 percent comes from renewables, according to the United States Energy Information Administration. Carbon-emitting natural-gas-powered plants generate about 40 percent of the state\u2019s electricity, according to the Energy Information Administration.\n\nGetting to an 85-percent cut in carbon emissions could mean fundamentally changing the way many New Yorkers live their lives. The state\u2019s transportation sector, for example, accounted for 37 percent of greenhouse-gas emissions in 2016, according to the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority. That was followed by \u201con-site\u201d combustion \u2014 heating \u2014 in the residential, commercial, and industrial sectors, which made up 30 percent of the state\u2019s carbon emissions.\n\nAll told, according to NYSERDA, fossil-fuel combustion accounted for 81-percent of total greenhouse-gas emissions in New York State in 2016.\n\nIn the coming week, The Enterprise will look at one possibility for trapping greenhouse-gas emissions that, according to a professor of agricultural science at Cornell University, if it were added to 10 percent of global cropland, could trap all of the greenhouse gas emitted by humanity on an annual basis.\n\nThis week, The Enterprise examines at how the state, its utilities, and municipalities are looking to wean themselves off of fossil fuels. New Scotland, for example, is taking advantage of incentives to turn dump lands into solar arrays.\n\nRenewables\n\nIn 2018, renewable energy sources accounted for about 28 percent of all the electricity generated in New York State, according to the United States Energy Information Administration. And the majority \u2014 about 81 percent \u2014 of that 28 percent was from hydropower.\n\nElectricity from wind power accounted for about 3.2 percent of all the power generated in the state in 2018, while energy generated from solar sources accounted for about 1.4 percent.\n\nThe state\u2019s push to have 70 percent of its electricity come from renewable energy sources by 2030 looks especially ambitious considering the nuclear-powered Indian Point Energy Center \u2014 which generates 12 percent of all the electricity in the state \u2014 is scheduled for complete closure by April 2021; that means the current 60 percent of electricity in the state coming from carbon-free sources, will soon be closer to half.\n\nTo get to the 70-percent threshold, the state has instituted certain mandates and coupled them with huge investments in renewable-energy projects.\n\nIn April 2018, a report from NYSERDA and the New York State Department of Public Service, established energy-efficiency targets for the state\u2019s investor-owned utilities, which would require the utilities to \u201creduce energy consumption\u201d in the state by the \u201cequivalent to fueling and powering 1.8 million New York homes by 2025,\u201d which would account for about 5 percent of what was forecast to be state\u2019s total primary energy use in 2025.\n\nAdditionally, the April 2018 report said, the reduction in energy consumption would \u201cdeliver nearly one-third of the [greenhouse gas] reductions needed to meet the State\u2019s climate goal\u2026\u201d\n\nIn December 2018, the New York Public Service Commission issued an order based on the April 2018 report. In addition, the PSC set an energy \u2014 or battery \u2014 storage goal of 1,500 megawatts of electricity by 2025, which is enough to power 1.2 million average-sized homes; by 2030, the PSC set an energy-storage goal of 3,000 megawatts.\n\nThe Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act says that 9,000 megawatts of offshore wind are to be installed by 2035; currently, zero megawatts of offshore wind have been installed off of the state\u2019s coast. There are, however, about 2,000 megawatts of wind power located in upstate New York.\n\nDuring the signing of the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that, at nearly 1,700 megawatts, the state had executed the country\u2019s largest offshore wind agreement as well as the largest renewable energy procurement by a single state in the nation\u2019s history. The two wind projects, which are to be built off the coast of Long Island, according to NYSERDA, \u201cwill produce enough electricity to power more than one million New York homes.\u201d\n\nThe new law also calls for 6,000 megawatts of solar to be installed in the state by 2025. As of the end of July, according to NYSERDA, about 30 percent of the state\u2019s solar-install goal had already been met. In addition, there were another 1,077-megawatts worth of projects in the works. In Albany County since 2000, there have been 3,795 commercial, industrial, and residential solar installations, accounting for about 78 megawatts of power.\n\nAccording to NYSERDA\u2019s Clean Energy Standard Annual Progress Report: 2017 Compliance Year, which was issued in February of this year, in 2017, the statewide electric load was 153,163,000 megawatts; about 72 percent, or 110,080,000 megawatts, was generated from non-renewable sources.\n\nBy 2030, the state\u2019s clean energy standard says that statewide electric load can be no more than 140,992,000 megawatts; 70 percent, or 98,694,400 megawatts, are to be generated from renewable sources.\n\nCurrently, however, between existing sources and projects in the works, only 53,967,000 megawatts of renewable energy can be accounted for, which means between now and 2030, another 44,727,000 megawatts of renewable energy will have to come online.\n\n\u201cDecarbonizing power generation\u201d will not be enough for New York State to meet its greenhouse-gas emission goals, according to an analysis of the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act by McKinsey and Company.\n\nNew Scotland\u2019s solar\n\nIn July 2017, amid an influx of inquiries into large-scale solar development, rural-turning-suburban town of New Scotland passed a local law governing solar energy with the primary goal of preserving farmland and open space. In December 2018, New Scotland\u2019s Planning Board approved the town\u2019s first large-scale solar farm.\n\nWhen complete, the 1.875-megawatt ground-mounted solar system at 331 New Scotland South Road will generate enough energy to power about 350 homes for one year, according to the site\u2019s developer.\n\nAt its August meeting, the New Scotland Town Board approved a request from Solomon Energy, a Connecticut-based energy advisory firm, to allow the company to solicit on behalf of the town proposals to install solar arrays on two town-owned landfills.\n\nIn 2018, NYSERDA published a new solar guidebook to help municipalities develop projects on underused properties like landfills and brownfields. The state\u2019s Department of Environmental Conservation also adopted new rules that made it easier to install solar arrays on the underused properties. Additionally, revisions were made to the financial incentives provided for developing projects in landfills and brownfields.\n\nThe first New Scotland site is located at 237 Upper Flatrock Road and is the home of the town\u2019s transfer station. The property is about 62 acres of which approximately 30 acres would be available for development. The second site is a 9.7-acre capped landfill located near the intersection of Upper Flatrock Road and Delaware Avenue; the entire property is available to be developed.\n\nWhat makes Solomon Energy\u2019s proposal so attractive to New Scotland is that all of the development responsibility is placed on the company, but the ultimate say over the project\u2019s fate remains with the town, which would receive a monthly rent check from the solar developer should the project get to that point.\n\n\u201cThe Town is attempting to utilize the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority NY-Sun Incentive Program which provides financial incentives for the installation of new grid-connected solar photovoltaic systems,\u201d Solomon\u2019s proposal states.\n\nThe NY-Sun public-private partnership program was started in 2012 to help increase the state\u2019s capacity of renewable solar energy. In 2014, Governor Cuomo announced a billion-dollar investment in the program that, according to NYSERDA, \u201cwould spur development of a market-driven, sustainable, subsidy-free solar industry\u201d while also launching \u201cthe statewide NY-Sun Incentive Program to help reach these goals.\u201d\n\nThrough March 31, according to NYSERDA, the NY-Sun program has funded the installation of 844 megawatts of solar with another 992 megawatts of projects in the works. Between pending and expended funds, the program has burned through close to three-quarters of its initial billion-dollar investment.\n\nNYSERDA says that NY-Sun-funded solar projects across the state, as of March 31, generate almost a million megawatt-hours of electricity each year, which reduces carbon emissions by half-a-million metric tons.\n\nLandfill-located solar farms acquired the sobriquet \u201cbrightfields\u201d in 1999, when the United States Department of Energy launched a new initiative aimed at repurposing contaminated sites around the country for the production of pollution-free solar energy.\n\n\u201cThis novel concept,\u201d according to the Department of Energy, \u201caddresse[d] three of the nation\u2019s greatest challenges: climate change, urban revitalization, and toxic waste cleanup.\u201d\n\nThe number of operational landfills in the United States has dropped by about 78 percent over roughly the past three decades, according to the most recently available data from the Environmental Protection Agency, from about 7,900 in 1988 to about 1,740 in 2015. During the same period, the number of active landfills in New York State went from 227 in 1988 to 27 today.\n\nAll of these closed-down landfills \u2014 \u201cplus portions of active landfills with closed cells\u201d \u2014 mean millions and millions of acres are available for solar development, about 15 million, in fact, according to the EPA.\n\n\u201cSolar\u2019s abundance and potential throughout the United States is staggering,\u201d according to the Department of Energy, if solar panels were installed on \u201cjust 0.6 percent of the nation\u2019s total land area\u201d \u2014 about 210,000 square miles or 13.4 million square acres \u2014 \u201c[that] could supply enough electricity to power the entire United States.\u201d\n\nLandfills are well-suited for solar development, according to the EPA, because they are often:\n\n\u2014 Located near critical infrastructure like roads and transmission lines;\n\n\u2014 Located near large population bases, which are areas with high energy demands\n\n\u2014 Built on flat surfaces, which are optimal for siting solar photovoltaic structures;\n\n\u2014 Offered at lower land costs; and\n\n\u2014 Able to accommodate utility-scale projects.\n\nTo date, the EPA has identified 289 contaminated lands, landfills, and mine sites across the country that contain a total of 311 renewable energy installations, which have a cumulative electricity-generating capacity of 1,561 megawatts. In addition, the EPA is tracking another 90 renewable-energy projects that are in various stages of planning, approval, or construction.\n\nWith 25 installations, New York State has the third-most renewable energy projects in the country; Massachusetts is first with 108 and New Jersey is second with 40 renewable energy installations.\n\n\u201cThe state of New York is finding ways to help encourage the development of renewable energy on brownfield and landfill sites,\u201d the EPA notes. Through the NY-Sun program, the state has supported renewable energy installations on contaminated sites and landfills in Troy, Hoosick Falls, and Saratoga Springs.\n\nThe solar array at the Clifton Park landfill in Clifton Park, for example, is a town-owned facility where nine of the landfill\u2019s 25 acres are covered in solar panels, which generate about 1 megawatt of power that is directed back into the electrical grid. Through a power-purchase agreement with the site\u2019s solar developer, over a 25-year period, the town will reduce its own carbon footprint by about 90 percent and see up to $2.5 million in savings.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s not a contaminated site or a landfill, a 22-acre solar site on Becker Road near Altamont came online in May, which will allow the Guilderland Central School District, through a power purchase agreement with the site\u2019s developer, Forefront Power, to offset 58 percent of the district\u2019s annual energy consumption, while reducing operating expenses by $4.5 million over the next two decades.\n\nAbout its potential landfill solar project, New Scotland Supervisor Douglas LaGrange told The Enterprise that the town\u2019s \u201cmain concern is a lease agreement.\u201d Solomon Energy\u2019s request for proposal does, however, ask that bidders include an \u201coff-taker statement,\u201d or power-purchase agreement but it appears to be boilerplate language.\n\nRight now, New Scotland wants to take advantage of its two municipally-owned landfills because, LaGrange said, the town felt there was an \u201cexcellent opportunity\u201d with the incentives offered by the NY-Sun program as well as the financial incentives provided for developing projects in landfills and brownfields.\n\nIf a solar project were approved by New Scotland, the generous incentives currently being offered to solar developers by New York State could soon be passed on to the town in the form of increased compensation, the town board was told at its meeting in April by Michael Hamor who was speaking on behalf of Solomon Energy.\n\nThe town is looking for income from the solar farm, LaGrange said, because it is already pursuing savings for residents through other avenues, specifically, the town\u2019s decision to enter into a Community Choice Aggregation administration agreement with the Municipal Electric and Gas Alliance, a not-for-profit development corporation, which could lead to a drop in residents\u2019 electric bills.\n\nLaGrange also pointed to another cost-saving project that has been in the works for some time, swapping out of the town\u2019s current street lights for high-efficiency light-emitting-diode street lights.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve got a lot of irons in the fire; we\u2019re trying to find every opportunity we can,\u201d LaGrange said. \u200b", "title": "Will New York produce enough renewable energy in time to meet its deadlines?", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "[]"}, {"id": 25, "city": "New York", "url": "https://www.climatechangenews.com/2019/04/23/new-york-city-bans-glass-skyscrapers-wa-state-end-coal/", "text": "New York mayor announces sweeping climate change programme, while Washington\u2019s power will be carbon-neutral by 2030\n\nBy Natalie Sauer\n\nWashington state will run completely on carbon neutral power by 2030 and New York City will spend $14bn on cutting its footprint, their governments announced on Monday.\n\nThe Big Apple and Western state respectively released a city-wide \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d and clean power bill on Monday.\n\nNew York mayor Bill de Blasio unveiled a raft of proposals in a bid to cut greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 30% by 2030, the deadline set by UN scientists to limit warming to 1.5C.\n\n\u201cEvery day we wait is a day our planet gets closer to the point of no-return.

Buildings account for 70% of the city\u2019s carbon pollution. The plan bans inefficient all-glass constructions, many of which have defined the city\u2019s iconic skyline. Such buildings will have to meet strict conditions to be built in future.\n\nMoreover, the city\u2019s administration will seek to power its operations from 100% clean energy by connecting the city to zero-emission Canadian hydropower.

The new law is the result of years\u2019 worth of lobbying by bird experts and advocates, The City reports.\n\n\u201cEvery year, hundreds of thousands of birds in New York \u2013 including over 100 species that we know of \u2013 die brutally and unnecessarily as a result of collisions with reflective or transparent glass buildings,\u201d Edita Birnkrant, executive director of New Yorkers for Clean, Livable, and Safe Streets, said at City Hall on Tuesday before the bill\u2019s passage. \u201cBirds are a critical part of our city\u2019s ecosystem, and for too long we haven\u2019t done enough to protect them.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, the city also passed legislation to outlaw the sale of foie gras and bird trafficking \u2013 but the city isn\u2019t the only place where bird-friendly laws have arisen. State Sen. Brad Hoylman has been working hard to pass a couple of bills focused on protecting the state\u2019s birds this past year \u2013 though not all have made it past Gov. Andrew Cuomo.\n\nYou may be wondering what\u2019s up with all of these new bird bills \u2013 and the simple answer is that these fragile creatures are in greater need of assistance than ever before. About 90,000 to 230,000 birds in New York City end up dying each year simply from crashing into buildings, according to the New York City Audubon. And it\u2019s estimated that two-thirds of North American bird species are facing extinction, among them many species that call New York home.\n\nHere\u2019s everything you need to know about the Empire State\u2019s latest bird-related legislation:\n\nBird-friendly materials bill\n\nThe city\u2019s new local law, which is expected to go into effect December 2020, will require new buildings (or buildings set to be renovated) to use materials on windows that make them much easier for birds to see, for the first 75 feet of the building \u2013 where most collisions happen.\n\nThis can be as simple as using windows with ultraviolet glass that is only visible to birds, or putting simple designs, screens or shades on windows, according to The City. None of these new requirements are expected to seriously impact the design aesthetics of any new buildings, so architects can rest easy.\n\nThe \u201cbird-friendly building council act\"\n\nThis legislation, sponsored and pushed for by state Sen. Brad Hoylman, sought to create a state council tasked with determining building regulations with birds\u2019 safety in mind for all of New York. The bill was vetoed by Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Nov. 20, after the governor said it would be too expensive to pass, though he did call it a \"laudatory pursuit.\"\n\nHarsher penalties for bird trafficking\n\nOn Oct. 30, the City Council instituted much more rigid penalties for trappers found guilty of capturing and transporting the city\u2019s pigeons for out-of-state shoots. The iconic city birds have been illegally hauled to other states for years, for the sole purpose of being released and shot at organized pigeon shoots.\n\nThe flap over the foie gras ban\n\nThe City Council also passed a bill to outlaw foie gras on Oct. 30, which will prevent the sale of the controversial French delicacy, beginning in 2022. But since the legislation\u2019s passing, duck farmers have been crying fowl.\n\nLast week, the New York Post reported that upstate duck farmers are hoping Cuomo will intervene and prevent the city\u2019s new bill from going into effect, claiming that it will severely harm their business. \u201cIt\u2019s sad to think Mayor de Blasio signed a bill that was based mostly on misinformation and lies about how ducks are raised and processed at our New York facilities,\u201d Sergio Saravia, president of La Belle Farms in the Hudson Valley, wrote in a letter penned to Cuomo.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear how Cuomo will act regarding this matter, but a spokesperson for the state Department of Agriculture told the Post that it is aware of the letter and will make a decision on how to move forward once a formal request to review the local law has been received.\n\nThe birds and bees protection act\n\nThis Hoylman-sponsored bill, introduced to the Senate in May, aims to eradicate the sale of pesticides, known as neonics, that are harmful to a variety of pollinators, such as birds and bees.\n\nThe bill is still in the process of being reviewed by the Senate\u2019s Environmental Conservation Committee, but environmental advocates, like the Natural Resources Defense Council, are hoping it\u2019ll pass and give bees and birds alike a breather.", "title": "The latest in New York bird law.

The demand caused rents to increase, leading to a housing shortage. At its height, more than two million rent-controlled apartments existed in the city, but only a small fraction remain: about 22,000, according to a 2017 survey.\n\nFor an apartment to be rent-controlled, a tenant or family member must have been living in the unit since at least July 1971, and the building had to have been built before 1947. Families can pass the unit to another member and preserve the rent-control status. A unit that falls out of rent control can be leased at market rate.\n\nThe second system, rent stabilization, applies generally to apartments in buildings with at least six units that were built between 1947 and 1974, buildings of that size built before 1947 where an apartment was leased after June 1971, and newer buildings that receive tax breaks for so-called affordable housing.\n\nRent increases at stabilized units are determined by the city\u2019s Rent Guidelines Board. This year the board allowed for 1.5 percent increases for one-year leases and 2.5 percent for two-year leases.\n\nWhat do the new changes mean for tenants?\n\nTenants in rent-regulated apartments would largely see an end to big rent increases under the new legislation. The Rent Guidelines Board will continue to determine yearly increases on rent-stabilized units, but the following rules that benefited landlords would be changed or abolished:\n\nVacancy decontrol: When the legal rent for a rent-stabilized apartment reached a certain rate, currently $2,774 per month, it could revert to market-rate if there is a vacancy. The rule has led to the deregulation of more than 155,000 units since it was enacted in the 1990s. This practice would be ended.\n\nThe vacancy bonus: Landlords for rent-stabilized apartments have been able to hike rents by as much as 20 percent after tenants moved out. The new rules would prevent that.\n\nRent hikes based on building improvements: Landlords have been able to increase rents in regulated apartments by up to 6 percent per year if they made improvements that \u201cdirectly or indirectly\u201d benefited all tenants, such as a new boiler. That increase would now be capped at 2 percent per year. Rent hikes that were permitted if landlords renovated or improved individual apartments would also now be limited.\n\nMisuse of \u201cpreferential\u201d rents: Landlords of rent-stabilized apartments can offer units to tenants for a price lower than the legal regulated rent. But they can no longer raise the rent to the legally mandated limit when a lease is renewed, a practice that was pushing tenants out.\n\nHigh-income deregulation: If a tenant in a rent-stabilized unit earned over $200,000 a year in two consecutive years, the landlord could deregulate the unit. That will no longer be allowed.\n\nThe \u201cowner-use\u201d loophole: Landlords and their family members have been able to remove rent-stabilized tenants from multiple units to use them as residences, a rule sometimes abused by landlords as a way to ultimately raise rents. Now, landlords will only be able to claim \u201cowner use\u201d for one apartment for use as their primary residence.\n\nWhat do the changes mean for landlords?\n\nTrade groups and real estate lobbyists warned of dire consequences as a result of the new regulations. They said smaller landlords could be run out of business because of new limits on rent increases and restrictions on raising rent after improvements. Ultimately, they said, units and buildings could fall into disrepair.\n\nSome analysts predicted that the New York housing market overall could be depressed because the resale market for rent-regulated apartments would lose value as a result of the changes.\n\nThe Real Estate Board of New York, an influential trade group that primarily represents larger developers, predicted that building owners would no longer have an incentive to invest in their rent-regulated units.", "title": "Rent Regulations in New York: How They\u2019ll Affect Tenants and Landlords", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['New York']"}, {"id": 30, "city": "New York", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/03/nyregion/nyc-airbnb-rentals.html", "text": "Jacob Tugendrajch, a spokesman for Mr. Johnson, called the law a \u201cvital protection against illegal hotels\u201d and said the Council would continue \u201cthe fight for this common sense, data-driven law.\u201d\n\nMr. de Blasio has contrasted home-sharing services with the hotel industry, which is subject to inspections and regulations that allow the city to hold owners accountable.

In 2017, for instance, there were around 560,000 more households in need of low-rent apartments than there were affordable ones on the market. Between 1999 and 2017, the city lost more than one million apartments renting for less than $800/month.

From New York City\u2019s ban on smoking in bars and restaurants in 2002 to the rise of the legal smoking age from 18 to 21 statewide in 2018, New York has made its feelings on tobacco loud and clear.\n\nThe reason for New York\u2019s fixation? Health, of course. By decreasing New Yorkers\u2019 secondhand smoke exposure and making it more difficult to buy or smoke cigarettes, the state hopes to reduce the number of smoking-related deaths per year \u2013 currently estimated around 12,000 in New York alone. Here\u2019s a timeline of New York\u2019s smoking restrictions to get you more acquainted with the city and state\u2019s efforts to kick the habit:\n\n1987: New York imposes public smoking regulations\n\nThe state Public Health Council limited smoking in public places, such as offices with more than two employees and most restaurants (those with more than 50 seats).\n\n2002: Smoking banned in bars and restaurants in New York City\n\nNew York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg signed a law that banned all smoking in bars and restaurants \u2013 with a few exceptions, like cigar bars. The city had banned most smoking in restaurants in 1995, but still allowed it in the bar areas of restaurants.\n\n2002: Increased tobacco taxation begins in New York City\n\nThe same year as the New York City bar and restaurant smoking ban, both the city and state increased taxes on cigarettes, which raised the price 32% from $5.20 to $6.85 a pack. Cigarettes in New York City had the highest combined city and state tax in the United States at the time.\n\n2003: Smoking banned in offices, bars and restaurants statewide\n\nThe introduction of the state Clean Indoor Air Act made it illegal to smoke in offices, on public transportation, and in bars and restaurants, among other locations, to minimize secondhand smoke exposure. In 2017, the act was amended to include the prohibition of e-cigarettes and vaping products as well.\n\n2011: New York City bans smoking in public\n\nBloomberg passed another measure to ban smoking in public spaces like parks, beaches, pools, recreation centers and various pedestrian plazas in New York City.\n\n2013: New York City raises the age to purchase tobacco products\n\nThe New York City Council passed a bill to raise the legal age required to purchase tobacco products from 18 to 21. Officials said that the younger people are when they begin smoking, the more likely they are to become addicted to tobacco.\n\n2018: Price minimums introduced for tobacco products\n\nMandatory price minimums for tobacco products went into effect, forcing tobacco vendors to raise the prices of their products. Now, cigarettes must be sold at a minimum of $13 per pack \u2013 and vendors must apply for an electronic cigarette retail dealer license if they want to sell any type of vaping product.\n\n2019: State raises the smoking age to 21\n\nIn July, Cuomo signed legislation to raise the legal tobacco smoking age from 18 to 21 throughout the state, which will go into effect in November. The measure includes all tobacco products as well as vaping products and e-cigarettes. New York and 17 other states have passed laws to raise the legal smoking age to 21.\n\n2019: Flavored tobacco products banned\n\nCuomo announced a move to ban flavored e-cigarettes and vaping products statewide, amid a recent rise in vaping-related illnesses and deaths that have medical professionals stumped. The New York City Council had already been pushing for a ban on these products. Concerns over the sale of these products escalated after recent reports revealed a heavy spike in children using flavored tobacco and vaping products in the city.", "title": "New York\u2019s efforts to snuff out smoking", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['New York']"}, {"id": 34, "city": "New York", "url": "https://ny.curbed.com/2019/11/22/20977760/new-york-free-parking-streets", "text": "Imagine what New York City could do with 500 million square feet of public space.\n\nImagine how much more room for people and housing and parks New York City would have if more than 10,000 football fields\u2019 worth of space suddenly became available. Or imagine how much revenue the city could generate if it charged anything close to market rate for each of the 2.94 million parking spaces that make up this approximately 500 million square feet of public space.\n\nFree parking in New York City and the problems it causes is currently having a moment. After years of withering attacks by Donald Shoup, a UCLA urban planning professor who has made the fight against parking his life\u2019s calling, a Manhattan community board has now picked up the thread. Community Board 7\u2019s transportation committee passed a resolution earlier this year calling for an end to on-street parking in its district, though the board has since walked that proposal back slightly.\n\nBut the board has a point: The costs of free parking\u2014cars sitting idle for days on end, essentially converting what should be public space into free private storage, or adding to traffic and pollution as drivers circle endlessly for their subsidized 180 square feet of street space\u2014have become abundantly clear. And with congestion pricing rolling out in a year, some New Yorkers want to reclaim all of this space, while some others want to price it accordingly.\n\nIn its examination of the issue, the New York Times asked, \u201cCould New York City Eliminate Free Street Parking?\u201d The answer is yes: There\u2019s never been a better time to end, once and for all, this massive giveaway of hundreds of millions of square feet of our city to drivers.\n\nFirst, some numbers. Based upon well-established research, New York City has approximately 3 million on-street parking spaces, and of those, more than 95 percent are free. (The rest are available for a nominal fee during business hours only.) And this massive giveaway benefits a minority of city households: According to Census data, of New York City\u2019s 3.1 million households, approximately 55 percent are car-free. In Manhattan, currently the subject of the fiercest debates over street space, a whopping 76.6 percent of households are car-free.\n\nMeanwhile, as with the arguments I made here on Curbed last year in favor of congestion pricing, charging for parking largely affects those who are well-off. Overall, New York City\u2019s car-owning households have a median income of $85,000, well above the city\u2019s median household income of $55,000 and more than double the $40,000 median income of car-free households.\n\nIn Manhattan, where the borough-wide median income is $75,000, car-owning households report a median income of $134,000, while car-free households have a median income of $69,000. Simply put, free street parking is a giveaway to people who don\u2019t need special perks and is a poor use of public space in a city where space is at a premium.\n\nThe negative effects of free parking on cities have also long been established. As Shoup has explored in a variety of books, free parking amounts to a nationwide subsidy on par with American defense spending. Because city residents expect free parking and car owners tend to ignore the negative externalities and costs of driving, free parking incentivizes driving when other means of faster, cleaner, and often more reliable transit are readily available. Traffic and pollution increase; congestion and the economic waste brought on by stopped traffic increase; and fatalities and pedestrian injuries increase as the number vehicle miles increases. Space that could be otherwise used for people or used to capture revenue is reserved to reward behavior harmful to urban life and urban residents.\n\nThen there\u2019s the fact that on-street parking wasn\u2019t always free or even legal in New York City. For decades, cars weren\u2019t permitted to park overnight on city streets; it wasn\u2019t until the 1950s, when the Department of Sanitation wanted to clean streets during the day, that the city chose to make a bad deal for itself and a good one for drivers. In exchange for free overnight parking, drivers would agree to move their cars every few days to accommodate street sweepers. Thus began the disastrous practice of giving away street space, and creating a wasteful system in which drivers or simply run their engines for the sake of it so street cleaners can get by.\n\nCharging for parking\u2014whether through a massive expansion of metered space, a residential permit program, or both\u2014rationalizes a system of transportation that currently encourages driving. As Shoup has detailed, charging for parking helps free up spaces by reducing demand, and drivers spend less time circling for spots and more time out of their cars, interacting with the city. In New York, where so many cars are registered out of state, a permit program could capture car registration fees lost to lax enforcement while allowing the city to realize revenue from underpriced public space. (Those hundreds of millions of square feet of sure could fund a lot of park improvement plans.)\n\nRemoving parking, of course, creates a political firestorm, and the Times article features its fair share of drivers complaining about the loss of a few thousand parking spots over the past few years, as the city has tried to keep pedestrians safe and make cycling safer. But in the age of climate change and of enlightened thinking about the allocation of street space, it\u2019s time to end the free parking giveaway. The city can start to capture the billions of dollars in currently gives away as subsidies to drivers, reduce congestion, and reallocate new revenue to transit development in underserved areas. The end of car culture is coming and the city\u2019s politicians should pick up the cause of Community Board 7 as it fights the good fight against free parking.\n\nBenjamin Kabak is the editor of Second Ave. Sagas , where he covers all things transportation in New York City.

Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio said last month. Commuters already paying tolls on bridges or tunnels entering Manhattan south of 61st Street also should get a break, they said. But lawmakers must define hardship and determine which toll-payers get the offset.\n\nThese policy decisions are among the most difficult for politicians, said Bruce Schaller, an international transportation consultant who first envisioned a congestion pricing program in 2007 as the city Transportation Department\u2019s deputy commissioner for traffic and planning. If the goal is to reduce traffic and produce maximum revenue for mass transit, no motorist should get a discount or credit merely for paying bridge tolls on the way into the city, he says.\n\n\u201cThe only reason to give someone an exemption is that they have to go into Manhattan and can\u2019t use public transportation,\u201d Schaller said. \u201cThe premise is to raise revenue and to encourage the use of transit.\u201d\n\nNew York Mayor Bill de Blasio (Natan Dvir/Bloomberg News)\n\nExempting disabled motorists might appear as a simple matter, yet Albany lawmakers continued to negotiate March 29, trying to compromise on language defining who would be covered.\n\n\u201cA congestion-pricing scheme must exempt drivers who have accessible parking placards,\u201d Ericka Jones, an advocate the Center for Disability Rights, told lawmakers at a budget hearing last month.\n\nPoliticians tend to be overly broad in granting such favors to voters, said Matthew Daus, a New York-based national transportation consultant and former chairman of the city Taxi and Limousine Commission.\n\n\u201cThe congestion-pricing plan should include carve-outs for people with disabilities, but where you draw the line can be a daunting challenge,\u201d Daus said.

He is now the eighth-wealthiest American, with a net worth of $54 billion, according to Forbes.\n\nBloomberg succeeded Rudy Giuliani as mayor in 2002 and served until 2013. He was succeeded by the current mayor, Bill de Blasio, who briefly ran for the Democratic presidential nomination before dropping out in September.\n\nIn 2013, near the end of his tenure, Bloomberg claimed that New York was the nation\u2019s safest big city. Our rating, looking at violent crimes plus property crimes, was Mostly True.\n\nNow let\u2019s dig into each of the four parts of his current claim.\n\n\u2018Reduced murders by 50%\u2019\n\nBloomberg\u2019s campaign cited data showing there were 649 murders in 2001, the year before Bloomberg took office, and 335 in 2013, his final year in office. That\u2019s a reduction of roughly half.\n\nBut murders started declining a decade before Bloomberg took office and continued downward after he left.\n\nMurders dropped \"precipitously\" during the 1990s \u2014 from roughly 2,200 at the start of the decade, noted Ames Grawert of the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law.\n\nGraphic from the New York City Mayor's Office of Criminal Justice\n\n\"Was the slope any steeper during Bloomberg than in the preceding decade? Not at all,\" said Jeffrey Fagan, a professor of law and a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University.\n\n\u2018Reduced police shootings to historic lows\u2019\n\nIn 2013, the total number of shots fired by officers \u2014 248 \u2014 and total shooting incidents \u2014 81 \u2014 were the lowest since the New York Police Department began keeping such records in 1971, according to the department\u2019s 2013 annual firearms discharge report, which Bloomberg\u2019s campaign cited. Police shot and killed eight people and injured 17 others that year, the report says.\n\nBut here, too, Bloomberg appears to be going too far by taking credit: The trend downward started before Bloomberg took office. And while shooting incidents hit the record low of 81 in 2013, they had risen to 105 a year earlier, during his tenure.\n\n\"The fact that reductions have continued under de Blasio shows that the declines are being driven by factors other than the municipal genius of mayoral-led policing and prosecutorial strategies,\" said Eugene O\u2019Donnell, a lecturer at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City.\n\n\u2018Reduced number of people incarcerated by nearly 40%\u2019\n\nIn 2001, the year before Bloomberg took office, New York City had 703 jailed or imprisoned inmates for every 100,000 residents, according to the mayor\u2019s Office of Criminal Justice. In 2013, it was 429 \u2014 a drop of 39%.\n\nThe same chart shows, however, that the decline began years before Bloomberg took office and has continued for years afterward, the figure was 910 in 1996 before dropping to the 703 in 2001, a decline of 23% in five years. And there\u2019s another issue.\n\n\"The criminal prosecution/punishment decisions are not those of the mayor or his administration,\" said Franklin Zimring, a University of California, Berkeley, School of Law faculty director of criminal justice studies and author of the 2012 book, \"The City That Became Safe: New York\u2019s Lessons for Urban Crime and Its Control.\"\n\n\u2018No other city in America did what we did\u2019\n\nBloomberg\u2019s campaign says no other city has achieved the three reductions Bloomberg touted. There is truth to that.\n\n\"New York City is in a class by itself in the country on public safety \u2014 serious crime has dropped for decades,\" O\u2019Donnell told us.\n\nBut comparisons are dicey.\n\nThe FBI is one of the strongest voices warning that city-to-city comparisons are invalid. Among other things, the FBI points out that no two cities are alike and the rates at which crimes are reported vary among cities.\n\nOur ruling\n\nBloomberg said, \"No other city in America did what we did. We reduced murders by 50%, reduced police shootings to historic lows, reduced the number of people incarcerated by nearly 40%.\"\n\nHe\u2019s generally on target, as each of the three statistical claims are backed by the numbers. But Bloomberg can\u2019t claim all the credit, in that the declines began before he took office and continued afterward; and experts including the FBI warn against using statistics to make city-to-city comparisons.\n\nFor a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.", "title": "New York crime did drop when 2020 hopeful Michael Bloomberg was mayor, but he claims too much credit", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "['crime', 'trend']", "annot_city": "['New York']"}, {"id": 38, "city": "New York", "url": "https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2019/12/29/nyc-murders-hate-crimes-2019/", "text": "NEW YORK (CBSNewYork/AP) \u2013 For several years, New York has prided itself as being the safest big city in America.\n\nThe NYPD and Mayor de Blasio have boasted about a continued drop in crime citywide, sending numbers to historic lows.\n\nAs CBS2 has been reporting on since March however, a closer look at those numbers finds several unnerving trends being masked by the overall lower crime rate.\n\nIn one of the NYPD\u2019s final weekly CompStat reports for the year, several major crimes have increased when compared to the same point in 2018.\n\nAs of Dec. 22, murders, robberies, felony assaults, shootings, sex crimes, and hate crimes are all on the rise throughout the five boroughs.\n\nSee The Full Report Here\n\nThe city has tallied 311 homicides, compared with 290 at the same point last year \u2013 an increase of 7.2 percent according to CompStat.\n\nIt\u2019s the second straight year of increases after the city achieved a modern-era low of 292 homicides in 2017, but authorities argue this year\u2019s total is skewed in part by an outsized number of deaths carried over from years past.\n\nAt least 27 deaths in this year\u2019s statistics happened prior to 2019 but weren\u2019t classified as homicides by the city\u2019s medical examiner until this year, the NYPD said.

Not only is dry desert air blowing into California, but as the air descends in elevation it warms, and the relative humidity plummets.\n\nOne tool forecasters use to predict Santa Ana winds is to measure the difference in pressure between Los Angeles International Airport and the community of Daggett in the San Bernardino County desert. The record for October \u2014 which sees particularly flammable vegetation if autumn rains haven\u2019t yet arrived \u2014 is negative 10.2 millibars, which occurred on Oct. 21 and Oct. 22, 2007.

That\u2019s why forecasters are so concerned this event may be extreme.\n\nThe monster Santa Ana event is being fueled in part by intensely cold high pressure over the Rocky Mountains.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s actually record cold air mass right now over the Rockies and the Great Basin,\u201d said Daniel Swain, climate scientist with UCLA and the National Center for Atmospheric Research. In Boulder, Colo., there\u2019s a foot of snow on the ground and the temperature is 9 degrees \u2014 in October.\n\n\u201cThis extremely cold air mass directly from the Arctic is sitting just to the east of California. And that is obviously a great contrast with the not-so-frigid air over California, and especially as you get closer to the ocean,\u201d Swain said. \u201cThat thermal contrast is setting up that strong pressure contrast, which is in turn driving these very strong winds.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile temperatures along the California coast are close to average for this time of year, they\u2019re well below average to the state\u2019s east \u2014 an extreme difference that\u2019s driving the winds, Swain said.\n\nThe air mass \u201cdropped straight down southward out of the Arctic over the Rockies because there\u2019s such a big mass of high pressure over Alaska right now, where they have been experiencing record warmth on a recurring basis, and where there is effectively no sea ice on the Arctic Ocean coast for the first time in recorded history in October.\u201d\n\nThe warm mass of air over Alaska, as a result, has had the effect of placing \u201ca big blob of cold air over the Rockies, which is creating this extreme contrast that\u2019s generating the winds in California,\u201d Swain said.\n\nMore graphics from our friends @NWSSPC indicating where very dry and windy conditions are expected Tues (today) and Wednesday this week.

The sharp increases paint a picture of a growing public health crisis in a region home to some of the richest neighborhoods and people in the US. Some key data from the report:\n\nMore than 44,000 (75%) of the homeless population are unsheltered, with more than 16,000 people living in cars and more than 11,000 in tents and makeshift shelters.\n\nThe number of homeless families increased by 8% to 8,800, with more than 1,600 of them unsheltered.\n\nYouth homelessness also increased by 24% to nearly 4,000, and more than half of young people are unsheltered.\n\nMore than half of unsheltered adults are experiencing homelessness for the first time.\n\nThe LA mayor, Eric Garcetti, called the increase \u201cheartbreaking\u201d in a statement. \u201cThese results remind us of a difficult truth: skyrocketing rents statewide and federal disinvestment in affordable housing, combined with an epidemic of untreated trauma and mental illness, is pushing people into homelessness faster than they can be lifted out,\u201d he said.\n\nThe report found that 53% of people suffering homelessness for the first time cited \u201ceconomic hardship\u201d as a leading factor, and that roughly one-quarter of the unsheltered adults lost their housing in 2018. A majority of the homeless people have also lived in the county for more than 10 years.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been crying out that this is a disaster of epic proportions,\u201d said the Rev Andy Bales, CEO of Union Rescue Mission, an LA homeless organization. \u201cThousands upon thousands are suffering in the streets \u2026 and the longer you leave people on the streets, the more devastating it is.\u201d\n\nThe crisis has disproportionately hit black Americans, who are four times more likely to experience homelessness in LA than other groups; they represent 33% of the homeless population despite representing only 8% of the county population.\n\nOfficials in LA county, which spent $619m on the crisis last year, said they had made progress in 2018, placing more than 21,000 people in homes, an increase of 23% from the previous year.\n\nThe Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (Lahsa) also noted that the exorbitant rent increases in the area combined with stagnant wages means one-third of households now spend more than 50% of income on rent. One recent study named LA the least-affordable housing market in the country.\n\nAn LA renter earning minimum wage would need to work 79 hours a week to afford a one-bedroom apartment, and the county would need more than 500,000 new affordable units to meet the needs of low-income renters.\n\n\u201cThe pressures on Angelenos are severe,\u201d Peter Lynn, Lahsa executive director, said at a public meeting unveiling the numbers, adding that the government \u201ccan help thousands of people exit homelessness, even as thousands more fall into homeless\u201d.\n\nBales said his own employees could not afford to live in LA and that the crisis was \u201cpast the tipping point\u201d, adding: \u201cI hope this is the wake-up call.\u201d\n\nThe data was released days after the Wall Street Journal reported that developers in LA have built a surplus of lavish mansions in posh LA neighborhoods \u2013 with price tags in the tens and hundreds of millions.\n\n\u201cThe unaffordability in this city is sending more and more people on to the streets,\u201d said Tracy Jeanne Rosenthal, co-founder of the LA Tenants Union. \u201cWhat is going on is out of control rent-gouging, real estate speculation, the destruction of rent-controlled housing, and the overdevelopment of luxury [housing],\u201d she added.\n\nRosenthal said she was tired of seeing the homeless criminalized and harassed by police, and that public housing and expanded rent control policies were critical to allowing people to stay in their homes and in LA.\n\nOnce people are evicted or pushed out due to huge rent hikes, they often have no other options for housing, she added: \u201cIf you\u2019re evicted in Los Angeles, you\u2019re evicted from Los Angeles.

People can still sell or trade the pelts of dead animals preserved through taxidermy.

The sole councilman to oppose the new law was Greig Smith, who was recently appointed to fill the seat vacated by Councilman Mitchell Englander.\n\nAt a committee meeting last week, Smith said he was deeply concerned about abruptly shutting down \u201clegitimate businesses,\u201d calling it \u201cnot American,\u201d and noted that the city had not estimated the economic impact.

Last year, a Gallup poll found that 60% of respondents deemed it \u201cmorally acceptable\u201d to buy and wear clothing made of animal fur.\n\n\u201cWe do not bully people or coerce them or force them to buy fur,\u201d said Donna Pappas, owner of Somper Furs. \u201cIt\u2019s our opponents who bully people.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPappas grew teary at one meeting at City Hall after pleading with officials to grandfather in existing businesses or give them more time before the law goes into effect.

Lesley McCave, communications director for Animal Defenders International, said that undercover videos and investigations had exposed nightmarish cruelty, including anal electrocution of animals, as well as cramped and filthy conditions.\n\nFur industry groups have disputed the accuracy of such videos.

When the homelessness issue burst onto front pages a few years ago, Garcetti jumped into action with an ambitious plan to build emergency shelters in all 15 districts of the city. But as the mayor soon discovered, the issue with an \u201cemergency\u201d plan oriented around construction is that Los Angeles is a far cry from Bob Moses\u2019s New York. Eighty percent of the shelters have been held up by red tape and community resistance. The short-term measures, then, must take the city\u2019s built environment as a given.\n\nA new sales tax boosted the city\u2019s budget for dealing with homelessness to more than $600 million, or $20,000 per homeless person, while a bond issuance brought in $1.2 billion to go toward constructing an estimated 10,000 housing units over the next decade, all of which would be preserved for people transitioning off the street or in danger of ending up there. Los Angeles has taken about 16 percent of the funds from its recent sales-tax increase and packaged it as vouchers to offer to a share of its homeless population, allowing them to buy into the rental marketplace with the understanding that their subsidy will fade over the course of a year, shifting the burden onto the new renter.\n\nWhile Los Angeles is right to want a program that moves people toward self-sufficiency\u2014both for the sake of the homeless themselves and to protect the city\u2019s coffers\u2014the steep monthly increases as the vouchers fade out often outpace the low-wage, part-time work the recipients are able to find. Unsurprisingly, for an alarming share of recipients, the program is more of a one-year reprieve than the start of a new, stable life. Short of doing something serious about the underlying cost of housing in Los Angeles, a limited pool of voucher dollars will forever chase rising rents.\n\nBefore the city\u2019s new homelessness count was released, the mayor had been touting the 20,000 people the city had moved off the street and into some form of housing. What we now know, however, is that while the Garcetti administration was helping to move 380 people off the street each week, some 480 others were joining the ranks of homeless Angelenos. Put another way, until someone does something about the city\u2019s larger housing crisis, homelessness will be as much a part of the city\u2019s landscape as Runyon Canyon.\n\nReihan Salam: Gavin Newsom\u2019s big idea", "title": "Los Angeles Is in Crisis.

A spokesman for Mayor Eric Garcetti said the mayor plans to sign the measure, which is expected to go into effect by the end of the week.\n\nThe L.A. rules were first passed nearly three years ago to impose new regulations after a federal court struck down a citywide ban on living in vehicles, calling it an invitation to discriminate against the poor.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThose restrictions were initially meant to be a stopgap measure while the city got \u201csafe parking\u201d programs up and running. They permitted vehicle dwellers to stay the night in industrial or commercial districts, but kept them out of residential neighborhoods where Angelenos had complained about scarce parking, trash and other nuisances tied to RVs.\n\nBut in the years since, the City Council has clamped down on overnight parking in many additional areas, imposing such restrictions street by street.\n\nMany of the bans have been targeted specifically at \u201coversize vehicles\u201d such as RVs. In the meantime, safe parking programs have been slow to get started.\n\nThe result is a \u201cde facto ban on living in vehicles at a time when nearly 10,000 Angelenos have literally no other housing option,\u201d said Shayla Myers, an attorney with the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the Tuesday meeting, several people argued that vehicles provided shelter and safety to people who would otherwise be bedding down on the streets. Cue Jn-Marie, pastor of the Church Without Walls on skid row, said that \u201ckicking people out of their car is a death sentence.\u201d\n\nViolating the vehicle dwelling rules is an infraction, punishable with a fine of up to $25 for the first offense, $50 for the second offense, and up to $75 for additional violations.\n\nIn a report last year, the Los Angeles Police Department said that 185 citations had been issued under the law between Feb. 6, 2017, and June 30, 2018 \u2014 approximately 10 citations a month.\n\nIn order to issue such a citation, police officers have to contact the person living in the vehicle and a violation can be \u201cdifficult to prove\u201d when they cannot look inside because the person refuses to respond, the report said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite those obstacles to enforcement, the lapse in the city rules had troubled some residents who argued that police needed the power to ticket RVs that park overnight in their neighborhoods.

O\u2019Farrell has planned to press forward with a ban, saying last year that it is \u201cone of those issues that we should\u2019ve acted on probably 10 years ago.\u201d\n\nBut that idea has raised concerns among disability rights advocates, who say that existing alternatives to plastic straws are not always practical or functional for people who need straws to drink. City staffers are preparing an analysis of how to ease the effects of a ban on people with disabilities, alongside the requested report on eliminating plastic straws.\n\nLos Angeles County approved a similar ordinance restricting plastic straws in December and it applies to as many as 1,300 restaurants and food businesses in unincorporated areas. Under the county rules, restaurants must ask customers if they want a plastic straw before giving one out. In the city, it would be up to the customer to make the request in a dine-in restaurant.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdena Tessler, a lobbyist representing the California Restaurant Assn., said at a recent council committee meeting that \u201cour biggest issue at this point, for the restaurants, is a lack of consistency\u201d among the state, city and county rules. O\u2019Farrell replied that his hope was that restaurant chains would simply follow the \u201cmore comprehensive\u201d L.A. rules in businesses across the county.\n\nPlastic straws were the sixth-most collected item on California Coastal Cleanup days from 1988 to 2016, behind cigarettes, food packaging, caps and lids, plastic bags, and plastic utensils and dishes, according to a city report. Los Angeles has already banned plastic bags for groceries, which O\u2019Farrell has credited for reducing bag waste in the L.A. River.\n\nO\u2019Farrell said that \u201calthough straws are a small part of the 8 million metric tons of plastic that end up in our ocean every year ... it is one thing that we can have really great control over.\u201d Councilman Paul Krekorian added that the new ordinance \u201cstarts to change the national conversation about single-use plastics as a whole.\u201d\n\nTimes staff writer Benjamin Oreskes contributed to this report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nemily.alpert@latimes.com\n\nTwitter: @AlpertReyes", "title": "L.A. approves new restrictions on disposable plastic straws, but stops short of a ban", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Los Angeles']"}, {"id": 48, "city": "Los Angeles", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2019/06/18/politics/los-angeles-homeless-crisis/index.html", "text": "(CNN) In Los Angeles' Skid Row, tents line entire city blocks. These makeshift shelters for the city's homeless are now an almost permanent fixture of the city's landscape, with barbecue grills and clusters of bikes standing alongside them.\n\nSome residents have tethered their tents to nearby fences and industrial buildings. Others run long power cords from their tents to nearby light poles to tap into the city's power grid. A few Skid Row pet owners have created small dog yards next to their tents under tarps to block out the sun and makeshift fencing. On a recent evening in this industrial part of LA's downtown, a young woman was washing her hair and her tank top in the jet of water gushing from a fire hydrant into the street.\n\nAs Los Angeles city and county officials struggle to shelter and build housing for nearly 60,000 people who are living on the streets, they are facing resistance -- not just to new structures in neighborhoods where residents fear more crime and blight, but also from some within the homeless community, who insist they would rather continue living independently on the streets in their tents.\n\nWhile the homeless crisis is perhaps most visible in California, it is gripping so many other cities, including Washington, that many of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates are beginning to face questions from voters about their plans. In 2018, about half of all Americans experiencing homelessness lived in one of five states -- California (24%), New York (17%), Florida (6%), Texas (5%) or Washington state (4%), according to the 2018 Annual Homeless Assessment Report , presented to Congress in December.\n\nIn dozens of interviews with unsheltered people in LA over the past year, many told CNN they won't apply for housing because they are afraid of the police, or unable to access the right documents to apply for ID, or sometimes simply wary of losing their independence if they are forced to live under rules that might be imposed if they moved into subsidized housing facilities.\n\nTents are now all over LA County. But the so-called \"shelter-resistant\" population is most evident in Skid Row, the portion of downtown where many of the city's homeless shelters, temporary housing and homeless services have traditionally been concentrated.\n\nAt the root of this tremendously complex problem is the fact that many within LA's unsheltered population are grappling with substance abuse addictions and untreated mental illness. Another major factor is that a series of lawsuits against the city -- aimed at preserving the rights of homeless people to protect their property -- has created a semipermanent tent culture in some sectors of LA.\n\nUnder city policy, tent-dwellers are required to take down their tents during daylight hours to clear the streets for pedestrians and business owners. But because of the lawsuits, that policy is not being uniformly enforced. In some areas it does not appear to be enforced at all.\n\nThe lawsuits and court injunctions against the city have had other unintended consequences. Because of the proliferation of tents, police say, it is much harder to identify and halt drug dealing and human trafficking. The legal battles have also complicated the city's ability to clear trash-strewn streets, because it is not easy to identify what bedding or clothing might belong to an unsheltered person living nearby.\n\nHomeless women most vulnerable\n\nThe way in which tent culture feeds resistance to housing is one of the greatest frustrations for Los Angeles Police Officer Deon Joseph, who has worked in Skid Row for more than two decades both as a homeless advocate and enforcer.\n\nDuring several nighttime patrols through Skid Row, he reeled off countless stories of unsheltered women who he has tried to get into the pipeline for housing, in part because they are among the most vulnerable to sexual assault, domestic violence and even demands for money from gang members who try to charge rent on certain blocks.\n\nSeveral times a year, Joseph holds what he calls \"Ladies Night\" for the women of Skid Row -- a workshop where he brings in advocates to teach self-defense, how to report assault and rape, and legal rights.\n\nHe often cites the example of a 70-year-old woman named Lena living in Skid Row who he got to know well but who was resistant to housing: \"I tried to house her, tried to house her, tried to house her,\" Joseph said, \"and then one day I came back and someone found her dead in a pile of garbage. A human being found in garbage.\"\n\nJoseph notes that scores of well-meaning volunteers and church groups show up on Skid Row each month to try to help the population by providing food, clothing and even new tents. But in Joseph's view, that assistance often perpetuates the cycle of people living on the street.\n\n\"The shelters and the missions here, they give food and clothes to draw people in to get the services to that help people get on their feet -- like drug programs, alcohol programs, domestic violence program, job programs,\" Joseph said. \"But many of the folks from here won't use them, because they're getting their needs met on the streets of Skid Row.\"\n\nRising homeless rate\n\nAs a result of several ballot measures approved by LA voters in the past few years, the city and the county spent hundreds of millions of dollars last year to address the homeless crisis. But the number of people living without shelter still went up 12% in the county and 16% in the city. Homelessness among youth and children rose 24% over the previous year, according to the 2019 Greater Los Angeles Homeless Count Results\n\nOf the nearly 60,000 people who are homeless in LA County, 19% told officials they came to LA County from out of state, 15% said they arrived from another part of California and 1.2% said they came from outside the United States.\n\nWhile the homeless count in Los Angeles was shocking, the rise in homelessness in neighboring counties was equally bracing. Homelessness was up 43% in Orange County over the previous year, 28% in Ventura County and 50% in Kern County.\n\nWhen questioned about why they had fallen into homelessness, 53% of those who said they were homeless for the first time in LA County cited \"economic hardship\"-- with the lack of affordable housing serving as a major driver for many.\n\nThe staggering homeless count rose despite the fact that LA's coordinated city-county homeless crisis response system helped 21,631 people move into permanent housing last year.\n\nAnother 31,500 people have been assessed by case managers and are waiting for housing or rental subsidies, according to city and county homeless officials. The county has opened eight new mental health urgent care centers and a sobering center to expand its outreach.\n\nHousing for the homeless\n\nWhile Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has confronted serious opposition in some neighborhoods even for his initial goal of placing 15 new shelters in City Council districts across the city, residents of some parts of Los Angeles County have been more receptive to housing for the homeless.\n\nOne example is the former Tiki Motel in LA County, a notorious site of neighborhood crime and blight that appeared in the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie \"The Terminator.\"\n\nAl Nunez, who grew up in East Los Angeles and was homeless for three years after his mother died of lung cancer, is one of the residents who now live at the converted Tiki Apartments.\n\nNunez was paralyzed by a gunshot wound to the spine 16 years ago. He often got sick during the time he was homeless, and would go days, he said, sleeping in his wheelchair.\n\n\"They would call me 'the statue,' \" he recalled in an interview. \"I was just alone because I was ashamed and embarrassed. Especially, where I was at -- it was my neighborhood where I grew up.\"\n\nFormer friends and acquaintances would often pass him on the street: \"They wouldn't even acknowledge me or say anything to me. But I understand, it's because it's a stigma like -- 'You're homeless' -- It's like I wasn't the same person.\"\n\n\"All I could think about is that I was going to either die from getting sick -- from being in my wheelchair -- or to the point where I wanted to take my own life because it was just a lot of suffering,\" he said. \"The only time I would go lay on a bed was when I would end up in the hospital. But ... once I was stable, it was like, 'You've got to go back on the street and fend for yourself.' \"\n\nAt another housing development called Mosaic Gardens at Willowbrook, in an unincorporated area of LA County, formerly homeless residents or those who were housed here because they were on the brink of homelessness have a playground, a computer lab and financial literacy programs, as well as access to services to help treat substance abuse or mental illness.\n\nSuny Lay Chang, the chief operating officer of LINC Housing Corp., which built the project, notes that they involved the community in the design, from the paint colors to the city-in-the-country feel that they tried to create with a community garden and kitchen.\n\n\"We have groups come in to lead cooking classes and demonstration classes to help people learn how to eat healthy, cook healthy. We'll use some of the vegetables from the community garden to do that,\" Chang said. \"It's part of treating the whole individual.\"\n\nThe project got off the ground, in part, because the community got behind it. One of the community leaders involved was Michael Torrence, a minister at nearby Fellowship Baptist Church who also directs a substance abuse prevention program for youth and families that is part of Volunteers of America of Greater Los Angeles.\n\nTorrence said residents from the Willowbrook community were there \"from the planning to the first shovel to the cutting of the ribbons.\"\n\n\"We feel a great sense of ownership,\" he said during an interview in the community kitchen of Mosaic Gardens at Willowbrook. \"I'm not a resident here, but as far as I'm concerned this is my place too.\"\n\nWhen asked about the resistance in other parts of Los Angeles to building homeless housing units and shelters, Torrence said he would argue that those neighborhoods will be safer if currently unsheltered people have ready access to wraparound services for substance abuse and mental health issues.\n\n\"Not in my backyard is only because you have a backyard right now,\" Torrence said. \"We have to recognize the fact that these are people.\"\n\n\"If we address this, and provide housing and assistance and support -- then you can get past the whole notion of this is the other -- and begin to see them as my neighbor,\" he said.\n\n\"So, your backyard? If they're invested in it, they will take care of the backyard.\"\n\nA national political issue\n\nWhen Los Angeles County released its shocking homeless count this month, Sen. Kamala Harris tweeted that housing is a \"human right,\" noting that her proposed LIFT Act -- to give lower-income working families a tax credit of up to $6,000 a year -- as well as her \"Rent Relief Act\" are intended to address the crisis.\n\nThe California Democrat and presidential candidate, addressing the Poor People's Campaign Forum in Washington on Monday, also introduced a new line in her campaign speech, saying, \"What we learn in that parable is that neighbor is that person you are walking by who is homeless on the street.\"\n\nJulian Castro recently toured storm tunnels beneath the Hard Rock Caf\u00e9 in Las Vegas where hundreds of homeless individuals have sought shelter -- and on Monday he outlined his plan to \"end chronic homelessness by the end of 2028.\"\n\n\"It wasn't lost on me or anyone else there that underneath hotels that are worth hundreds of millions of dollars,\" Castro said, \"you have people who are living in deep poverty, sleeping not even in the street but in a drainage tunnel.\"\n\nCalifornia voters approached both Joe Biden and Beto O'Rourke citing homelessness as a top concern during their respective visits to the Golden State. A voter in San Diego -- a city that erected enormous tent shelters last year to temporarily house hundreds of people -- told O'Rourke she was worried about the number of veterans living on the streets. The former Texas congressman noted that some of the homeless veterans he has spoken to in his home state had to wait so long for mental health treatment that they sought drugs on the street to treat their symptoms.\n\n\"If you cannot see a doctor and be well enough -- then there's a more likely chance that you're going to be homeless in the first place,\" O'Rourke told the voter during his San Diego town hall in late April. \"So starting with health care for everybody -- without exception, including mental health care -- is so fundamental to being able to get this done. And in California, perhaps especially, where housing prices are going through the roof, we've got to make sure that we are creating enough housing units for the demand that is here.\"\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont routinely highlights the growing number of homeless people nationwide as he rails against the fact that 40 million people are living in poverty while the \"very rich\" are \"getting richer.\" \"Tonight some 500,000 Americans, including many veterans, will be sleeping out on the streets,\" Sanders said during a speech earlier this month at George Washington University.", "title": "Los Angeles' homeless crisis: too many tents, too few beds", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Los Angeles']"}, {"id": 49, "city": "Los Angeles", "url": "https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-08-15/city-workers-trash-bodily-fluids-los-angeles-civic-center", "text": "The state agency that enforces workplace safety rules says employees of the city of Los Angeles were exposed to unsanitary conditions on the walkways outside City Hall East, according to two citations issued last week.\n\nInspectors with the Division of Occupational Safety and Health, or Cal/OSHA, found that workers at City Hall East were exposed to \u201ctrash and bodily fluids\u201d on the exterior passageways.

Massachusetts also recently instated a four-month ban on e-cigarettes, while Michigan and New York have outlawed flavored e-cigarette products.\n\nL.A.'s proposal, introduced at Tuesday\u2019s City Council meeting, would prohibit the sale of e-cigarette and vaping devices until they are deemed safe by the Food and Drug Administration. Because the FDA has approved almost no such devices, the law would essentially ban all of them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe reports of illness and death caused by unregulated vaping devices is a public health crisis,\u201d reads the motion introduced by Councilman Paul Koretz. \u201cLos Angeles is not content to wait and do nothing as the numbers of illnesses and even deaths associated with unregulated vaping devices increases daily.\u201d\n\nKoretz\u2019s proposal was referred to a council committee focused on health, which would vet the idea before deciding whether to send it to the full council for a vote. If passed, city lawyers would draft an ordinance for council approval.\n\nThe lung illnesses have so far taken 18 lives nationwide and remain somewhat of a mystery, with health officials saying they are unsure what exactly is causing them. California health officials have advised people to stop vaping until the picture becomes more clear.\n\nThe outbreak has also prompted a wave of legislation that has caused a rift among public health experts. While some believe that e-cigarette restrictions will help prevent another generation from becoming addicted to nicotine, others worry they will take away options for adults trying to quit smoking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOpponents point out that the majority of people who have become ill due to vaping had used products with THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, mostly those acquired illegally. But most new bans are targeting nicotine delivered via e-cigarettes, which some experts believe can aid smokers who want to stop using cigarettes.\n\n\u201cNo one in Los Angeles apparently wants to look uncool by bringing up very real dangers posed by illicit THC products,\u201d said Gregory Conley, president of the advocacy group American Vaping Assn. \u201cBut unless they want these illnesses and deaths to continue to happen, someone has to do it.\u201d\n\nHealth experts opposed to e-cigarette bans say they will drive former smokers back to cigarettes, which remain more dangerous, or will push them to buy nicotine products on the black market.\n\n\u201cWhat bans like this are likely to do is increase the use of illicit products and decrease regulation, which ironically will expand the use of the products that are causing folks to get sick,\u201d said Leo Beletsky, a public health professor at Northeastern University.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome officials have compromised by banning only flavored tobacco products, which are particularly appealing to young people and linked to the surge in high school use of e-cigarettes. A 2019 national survey by the University of Michigan found that 1 in 4 of the nation\u2019s 12th-graders have used an e-cigarette in the last month \u2014 a trend that experts say threatens to reverse decades of success in lowering tobacco use among children.\n\n\u201cWe really did get the rates down pretty low, and then this e-cigarette thing happened and it all kind of blew up again,\u201d said Gael O\u2019Sullivan, an expert in health marketing at the Georgetown University McDonough School of Business. \u201cAs unfortunate as these illnesses or deaths are, it\u2019s a tipping point where it really is a public health emergency.\u201d\n\nLos Angeles County passed a ban last week that will outlaw flavored e-cigarettes as well as menthol cigarettes starting at the end of the month. The ban will apply to the 1 million people who live in unincorporated areas of the county.\n\nThe Trump administration has also proposed a ban on flavored e-cigarettes, and several states, including Ohio and Washington, are on their way to adopting similar laws.

That means renters make up 34% of the U.S. population, up a full percentage point from a decade ago.\n\nThat number is nearly double in L.A., where renters make up 60% of the population. That ranks as the 19th-highest rate among the country\u2019s 260 largest cities. Glendale boasts the state\u2019s highest concentration of renters at 67%.\n\nOver the course of the decade, 2.4 million apartment units were built in the U.S. to meet the rising demand, the study found. Roughly 98,000 of those were constructed in L.A., good for fifth-most in the country. A flurry of notable developments moved forward this year, including a controversial project that\u2019s adding 725 units across five seven-story apartment buildings in Chinatown.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther developers are taking advantage of a city program that allows for larger-than-usual projects near transit if developers ensure some units are affordable for people with lower incomes. On Venice Boulevard, one such builder is erecting an eight-story building with 79 units on a site zoned for 46 units by reserving eight for low-income households.\n\nWith land at a premium, however, apartments are becoming smaller. In 2010, new apartments covered an average of 990 square feet. Now, they average 933 square feet, according to the report. That\u2019s a drop-off of 57 square feet \u2014 roughly the size of a small office or storage room.\n\nThe national average decrease is about 6%, but in Anaheim, new apartments shrank an average of 12%, which is the eighth-largest drop-off in the country.\n\nThe new rent control laws coming in 2020 will last for a decade and look to help out the roughly 9.5 million renters in California who spend more than 30% of their income on housing costs.

The city may be known for its gridlock and smog, but it also has an ambitious plan to transform itself to tackle climate change. Today, the city announced how it\u2019s accelerating its plans, moving to renewable energy, emissions-free buildings and vehicles, and reducing its water use\u2014all while creating green jobs for its low-income communities.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything radical about creating a cleaner future for our grandchildren,\u201d Mayor Eric Garcetti says on a call announcing the plan. \u201cI hope that what we\u2019re doing in LA will serve as a \u2018greenprint\u2019 for every city in the country and across the world. When we take a stand, it doesn\u2019t matter that the president wants to boost fossil fuel production because most of America will already have been moving to a low carbon green energy world.\u201d\n\n100% renewable electricity\n\nBy 2025, L.A. plans to run on 55% renewable electricity and stop using coal power entirely. Instead of repairing three natural gas power plants along the coast, it will shut them down. By 2036, it will get to 80% renewables. By 2045, like the rest of California, it will run on 100% renewables. (The 2028 Olympics will also run on 100% clean power.) Community solar programs will help low-income households and renters get solar panels. The city\u2019s deadlines for ramping up clean power have accelerated based on \u201can understanding of the severity of the threat and the pace at which we need to move, but also [an understanding] that the technology is there,\u201d says Lauren Faber O\u2019Connor, chief sustainability officer for the City of Los Angeles. \u201cThese opportunities to have a smarter, more flexible, and cleaner grid have never been more plentiful.\u201d\n\nNet zero carbon buildings\n\nAs in New York City, which recently announced plans to shrink the carbon footprint of its skyscrapers, Los Angeles\u2019s largest source of emissions isn\u2019t cars but residential and commercial buildings. By 2030, all new buildings in the city will have to be emissions-free. By 2050, every existing building will have to be retrofitted to meet the same goal. The city is also pioneering new construction methods, as the first large city to require all-electric construction equipment on city buildings. \u201cWe have to demand the most aggressive emissions reductions coming from our buildings,\u201d says O\u2019Connor.\n\nZero emissions transportation\n\nRight now, most Angelenos commute to work as the sole occupant of a car. Last year, each one spent an average of 128 hours stuck in traffic. L.A. wants to get more commuters into public transit and is expanding its subway and metro lines to help, along with building new housing next to transit centers. Garcetti says that his administration has paved more streets than any in LA\u2019s history, but \u201cwho cares about potholes if Venice is underwater.\u201d The city is also building the infrastructure to help people who keep driving make the switch to electric cars\u2014including 25,000 new electric charging stations by 2025. Crosswalks and routes to walk to school will become safer. To make it easier to walk in hot weather, the city is planting shade trees and adding cool pavements. The network of bike lanes and bike sharing will expand. School buses and taxis will reach zero emissions by 2028; urban delivery vehicles will reach that goal by 2035. By 2050, every vehicle in the city will have zero emissions.\n\nReducing reliance on imported water\n\nMore than a century ago, L.A. essentially stole water from the Owens Valley 200 miles away. The city also relies on water from Northern California and the Colorado River. Now, however, it wants to begin to source the majority of its water locally. Rain that typically flows over pavement and into storm drains will be captured through a \u201csponge city\u201d design of permeable pavement and rain gardens. All wastewater will be recycled by 2035. As drought becomes more likely, the city will also continue to cut water use.\n\nEnvironmental justice\n\nAs L.A. transforms, the city is focusing particularly on the poorest communities, which have been hardest hit by environmental problems like air pollution in the past. Several projects will directly impact neighborhoods\u2014cutting emissions from ships at the ports, for example, is helping reduce childhood asthma rates in Long Beach. In Watts, the Jordan Downs public housing project is being rebuilt into an affordable community with electric car sharing, solar power, new bike lanes, thousands of new trees, and 50 small urban farms.", "title": "Los Angeles just announced its own Green New Deal to drastically slash emissions", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Los Angeles']"}, {"id": 54, "city": "Los Angeles", "url": "https://www.governing.com/news/headlines/Los-Angeles-City-Workers-Still-Pay-Nothing-for-Healthcare.html", "text": "(TNS) \u2014 In a major policy reversal that critics say will cost the city and taxpayers millions of dollars, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has abandoned his long-stated goal of getting the city's public employee unions to pay a portion of their healthcare costs.\n\nUnder contracts signed this year that were supported by the mayor, many of City Hall's largest unions will continue to contribute nothing toward their healthcare premiums. Garcetti also backed agreements with several smaller unions, allowing those employees who had been contributing 10% of their premiums to stop paying in January.\n\nThe decision is an about-face from what Garcetti told voters while first running for mayor. He had vowed to push city employees to contribute 10% toward the cost of their healthcare.\n\n\"You get elected talking tough,\" said Christopher Thornberg, founder of consulting firm Beacon Economics. \"Then you get into office and roll over.\"\n\nCritics say Garcetti is ignoring warnings about City Hall's shaky finances, as budget analysts warn of looming deficits. It also reflects how his public relationship with labor unions has shifted from adversarial to friendly since he first ran for mayor.\n\nGarcetti said union leaders persuaded him that requiring contributions would hurt the poorest city employees. He said he instead chose other strategies for cutting costs, such as persuading unions to give up pay raises in certain years.\n\n\"I'm agnostic about where you save money,\" he said. \"Whether it's in healthcare or in less of a raise, a dollar is a dollar is a dollar.\"\n\nBudget analysts said last month that the city faces annual deficits of $200 million to $400 million because of new labor deals that leave the city on the hook for raises and healthcare costs for police, fire and civilian workers.\n\nL.A.'s practice of paying 100% of the cost of the healthcare premiums for most of its 50,000 city employees \u2014 though workers chip in toward co-pays and prescription fees \u2014 \"is not typical,\" according to a 2017 city controller audit. The review cited a national study that showed the overwhelming majority of large government employers require employees to chip in.\n\nAccording to a Times analysis, the city is projected to spend at least $740 million on healthcare for all of its employees this year \u2014 a 34% increase over spending in 2013, when Garcetti first took office. The city also is paying more for healthcare in part because of the thousands of employees have been hired in recent years.\n\nGarcetti had said on the campaign trail that year that he'd stand up to public employee unions and rein in rising costs at City Hall.\n\nAt the time, Los Angeles was still recovering from a recession that had led to employee furloughs and cuts to basic city services, including sidewalk repairs, tree trimming and street paving. Like other cities across the country, the downturn drained tax revenue. Healthcare, salaries and pension costs for public employees were consuming a concerning share of the city budget.\n\nToday, though, L.A.'s economy is humming along and most of the city's workers still pay nothing toward their healthcare costs.\n\nGarcetti said the city has had success negotiating prices with healthcare companies. This year, he said, there is no rise in civilian healthcare premiums for the city, for example. Overall, that cost has risen 22% since Garcetti first became mayor, his office said.\n\nJohn J. Pitney Jr., a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College, said there's less pressure on politicians to get labor concessions because the economy has been strong and polls show the public views unions more favorably. At the same time, the national Democratic Party is focused on lowering healthcare costs for individuals.\n\n\"In good times, politicians can be more generous,\" Pitney said.\n\nAfter the 2009 recession plunged L.A. City Hall into financial crisis, then-Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa convinced the group representing engineers and architects to pay 5% toward their healthcare premiums, or about $65 a month. Villaraigosa said at the time it was the first time a union had made such a concession.\n\nThe following year in 2011, then-Councilman Garcetti stood next to Villaraigosa at City Hall to announce that city workers had agreed to pay toward their retirement healthcare costs.\n\nThe city's largest labor groups declined to endorse Garcetti in the mayor's race two years later, but he used that to his advantage, saying he'd be independent from labor and telling voters he had already won healthcare concessions from workers.\n\nCity workers \"have to have some skin in the game, because when healthcare costs triple, they don't feel it,\" Garcetti during at a 2013 debate at Loyola Marymount University.\n\nAfter winning, Garcetti began paying 10% toward his own healthcare premium as part of a labor deal with City Hall's executives. Several smaller employee groups also began pitching in 5% to 10% toward their healthcare premiums under contracts inked during Garcetti's first term.\n\nBut the mayor encountered resistance from the Department of Water and Power's largest union, which refused the concession in its 2013 and 2017 contracts. However, Garcetti and other negotiators convinced the union to forgo raises in its 2013 agreement, which saved the city $385 million, budget analysts said.\n\nThe Coalition of L.A. City Unions, the largest civilian employment group representing 20,000 workers, also balked. Its leaders refused to pay the 10% healthcare premium as part of a 2015 contract, though they did agree to defer raises.\n\nTheir contract that passed this year also doesn't require a healthcare contribution.\n\nThe coalition \"would absolutely never agree\" to it, said City Councilman Paul Koretz, who serves alongside the mayor on a panel that negotiates with unions. Koretz said he was never fully on board with the healthcare concession plan, saying it was hatched during the recession.\n\nWithout the backing of the Coalition of L.A. City Unions, city leaders abandoned their goal. Several labor unions that had been contributing to healthcare premiums, including the management labor group of which Garcetti is a member and the union representing engineers and architects, will stop next year.\n\nMembers of the Engineers and Architects Assn. also will get a one-time cash payout from the city. Michael Davies, the union's interim executive director, said it was for \"past sacrifices,\" including payments members made toward healthcare.\n\nSEIU Local 721 President Bob Schoonover cast the city's one-time push for healthcare contributions within the broader context of shrinking benefits for middle-class workers across many industries. He called it a \"race-to-the-bottom mentality.\"\n\nIt's unclear how much money the city could have saved if employees contributed to their healthcare costs, but a 2013 report predicted as much as $50 million annually in savings.\n\nBudget analysts have warned that the city will face deficits in the next four years. City departments were ordered to find ways to reduce costs.\n\nGarcetti said those concerns weren't unusual. He said budget officials always \"warn people that the sky is falling\" in order to push departments to save money.\n\nBut Pitney sees risks for Garcetti if a recession squeezes City Hall's budget.\n\n\"There is a chance that this could come back and hurt him,\" Pitney said.\n\n\u00a92019 the Los Angeles Times.

But cases of the disease have actually been increasing in California for more than a decade.\n\nThirteen people in the state were diagnosed with typhus in 2008, compared with 167 last year. More than 95% of the people falling sick in California are in Los Angeles and Orange counties, according to state health data.\n\nLos Angeles City Council President Herb Wesson says he wants to examine the real cause of the typhus cases. On Friday, a giant inflatable rat loomed outside the building while officials inside discussed the vermin issue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMurine typhus, also known as endemic typhus, typically causes flu-like symptoms, but can in rare cases be fatal. It is not to be confused with typhoid fever, a food-borne illness that is rarely contracted within the United States.\n\nOfficials don\u2019t keep count of how many cases of murine typhus there are each year nationwide, but among states that do track the numbers \u2014 California, Texas and Hawaii \u2014 more people have been falling ill each year, experts say.\n\nWhy? Theories abound.\n\nMore homelessness\n\nIn October, L.A. County officials declared a typhus outbreak in downtown L.A. around skid row. The announcement prompted calls to clean up the streets and find housing for the city\u2019s homeless population, which has burgeoned in recent years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Los Angeles Times)\n\nTyphus is often linked to unsanitary conditions and overcrowding, experts say.\n\nAnimals including rats and cats carry the disease in their bodies, though it doesn\u2019t make them ill. Fleas transmit the disease to humans by biting the infected animals and then biting humans, something that could become more common as more people live on the streets.\n\n\u201cIn major cities in the U.S., we hear about increasing numbers of encampments and people living in squalor,\u201d said Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, a professor at UCLA\u2019s Fielding School of Public Health. \u201cThose conditions are ideal for increase in vermin like rats.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmong the 19 people who have been infected as part of the typhus outbreak in downtown Los Angeles, eight were homeless, according to the county health department.\n\nDr. Stuart Cohen, chief of the division of infectious diseases at UC Davis, pointed out that a large outbreak of hepatitis A in San Diego that killed 20 people was also linked to the homeless population.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the same kind of thing: Homeless populations increase and the amount of garbage that\u2019s available on the street is increasing \u2014 the ability to transmit all this other stuff also increases,\u201d he said.\n\nClimate change\n\nThe effects of global warming could also be causing more cases of typhus, said Dr. Jeff Duchin, a spokesman for the Infectious Disease Society of America and an infectious-disease professor at the University of Washington.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLonger and warmer spring and summer seasons are more hospitable to insects and allow them to reproduce more, Duchin said. The trend extends beyond typhus and fleas, he said.\n\nBetween 2004 and 2016, the number of cases of diseases caused by mosquito, flea and tick bites tripled nationwide, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\nMore human interaction with wildlife\n\nRecent outbreaks of typhus in Pasadena and Pomona have been linked not to rats \u2014 associated with dirty cities \u2014 but with stray cats and opossums. Experts say those outbreaks were the consequence of building homes closer to wilderness.\n\n\u201cAs some of these suburban areas encroach upon some of these habitats for opossums and other rodents, the chances of getting flea bites and therefore picking up the infection increases,\u201d Cohen said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDuring the last typhus outbreak in Los Angeles County, in 2015, a single opossum captured in a mobile home park in Pomona had 1,087 fleas on it. Three-fifths of the fleas tested from the cats and opossums that were trapped tested positive for typhus.\n\nLos Angeles County health officials would not say which animals are to blame for the downtown outbreak. But many people are pointing to rats.\n\nL.A. Councilman Joe Buscaino tweeted a photo last week of a sign at City Hall with tips on how to avoid attracting rodents. City workers say they\u2019ve seen fleas, rodent droppings, and plants being eaten by the vermin in the building.\n\nBuscaino captioned the photo: \u201cIt\u2019s all fun and games until someone gets typhus.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIncreased awareness\n\nThe symptoms of typhus, which include body aches, fever and stomach pain, tend to resemble other illnesses. Elizabeth Greenwood, the city employee who fell ill with typhus, was first diagnosed with meningitis.\n\nIt\u2019s possible that more people learning about typhus in recent years has made it seem that there are more cases, said Gilbert Kersh, the CDC\u2019s chief of the Rickettsial Zoonoses branch, which focuses on bacterial diseases spread by fleas, lice and ticks.\n\n\u201cOnce people are aware that it\u2019s in their area, they might start considering it as the diagnosis, and that can lead to revealing more cases that were there already,\u201d he said.\n\nsoumya.karlamangla@latimes.com\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwitter: @skarlamangla", "title": "Long before City Hall rats, L.A. has struggled with the rise of typhus", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Los Angeles']"}, {"id": 56, "city": "Los Angeles", "url": "https://www.fastcompany.com/90436610/how-los-angeles-plans-to-get-hundreds-of-thousands-of-people-out-of-cars", "text": "Los Angeles has a reputation as a car-dependent city. But the city (and the surrounding county) also now has the country\u2019s most ambitious plan for cutting emissions from transportation. In less than a decade, it wants the majority of new cars to be electric and all city buses to be electric\u2014and it wants 20% of trips that currently happen in single-occupancy cars to shift to public transportation or active transportation like biking.\n\nToday, a set of partners released the Zero Emissions 2028 Roadmap 2.0, a plan that outlines how the region can drastically cut transit emissions by 2028 to address both climate change and the health impacts of smog. Convincing Angelenos to drive less is a key part of the plan.\n\n\u201cIn the modeling, we looked extensively at different scenarios for the number of electric cars and zero-emission trucks that would need to be on the road, and chargers to serve those vehicles,\u201d says Matt Petersen, president and CEO of the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator, which convened a group of partners last year to set initial targets, now spelled out in more detail. \u201cAnd we recognize that one of the key ways we\u2019re going to achieve the reduction goal for greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution is mode shift: How do we get people out of their cars into public transit or active transit?\u201d\n\nIf they do drive, the city wants them using electric vehicles. To help make the shift easier, the city, county, and other partners plan to blanket the area in 84,000 public and workplace charging stations and add chargers where they\u2019re particularly critical, like at apartment buildings. It will also use incentives to help consumers, especially low-income drivers, afford electric cars. By 2028, 30% of cars on the road will be electric, and 80% of new cars sold will be electric. Larger trucks will also move to electric power, a major road from the port will become the first \u201czero-emissions goods movement corridor\u201d in the country, and the city will test zero-emissions delivery zones for packages. But to stay on track to cut emissions, the biggest change the city will have to manage is making it easier not to drive at all.\n\nPart of that means improving public transportation, both in the routes that are available and the quality of the experience. The shift to electric buses\u2014which are quieter than rattling diesel or natural gas buses, and often come with amenities such as Wi-Fi and charging\u2014can help. \u201cThose are the kinds of things that are going to make discretionary riders more interested and eager and willing to get out of their cars,\u201d says Petersen.\n\nExpanding micromobility can also help; a recent report in Santa Monica found that 49% of the trips that people were taking on electric scooters and shared bikes were replacing short trips that otherwise would have happened in cars. Some projects now are working to expand access to micromobility in neighborhoods that don\u2019t have many options. Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator, for example, is running a pilot with a nonprofit building a solar-powered e-bike share project in the community of Huntington Park. (Other pilot projects are expanding access to electric car sharing in low-income neighborhoods; if residents use that option instead of owning cars themselves, they also may be likely to drive less.) Designing streets to make it safer to ride a bike\u2014such as a two-way protected bike lane that was installed in downtown L.A. earlier this year\u2014is also a key part of helping people shift away from cars.\n\nThe Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority also now plans to study the idea of congestion pricing, the type of road fee that London uses to reduce traffic in the city center. (If it happens, it may come with an incentive like free bus service.) In 2017, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti signed the Fossil Fuel Free Streets Declaration, a pledge to \u201cenvision a future where walking, cycling, and shared transport are how the majority of citizens move around our cities\u201d and to create a major emissions-free zone.", "title": "How Los Angeles plans to get hundreds of thousands of people out of cars", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Los Angeles']"}, {"id": 57, "city": "Chicago", "url": "https://chicago.suntimes.com/2019/1/31/18413970/chicago-misses-all-time-record-but-cold-snap-was-still-historic", "text": "After cold temperatures in Chicago set a new daily record and nearly dropped to an all-time low on Thursday, the second day of a brutal cold snap, the city is expected to see a sizable snowfall starting Thursday night.\n\nThursday morning temperatures dipped to 21 degrees below zero \u2014 minus 39 degrees with wind chill, according to the National Weather Service.

It garnered a total of 61.48 points and surpassed perennial favorites such as Seattle, San Francisco and Austin.\n\nChicago also gained points for its growth in LEED-certified buildings. Since 2014, the city has added 395 LEED-certified buildings to its inventory, bringing the total to 1,303. Chicago was 2nd overall in terms of its number of LEED-certified buildings in 2019.\n\nSigns point to the fact that these factors are becoming more important to consumers. According to a 2018 poll conducted at Yale University, more than half of Americans (57 percent) say they understand that most scientists agree that global warming is happening, and seven out of 10 Americans now say that global warming is \u201cpersonally important\u201d to them. While the majority of those polled felt \u201cdisgusted\u201d and/or \u201chelpless\u201d nearly half (48 percent) were \u201chopeful\u201d that something could be done to address climate change.", "title": "Chicago ranked 6th among 50 most sustainable cities", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Chicago']"}, {"id": 59, "city": "Chicago", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/us/chicago-cps-teachers-strike.html", "text": "CHICAGO \u2014 More than 300,000 public school students prepared to return to school as Chicago leaders on Thursday announced an end to an acrimonious teachers\u2019 strike that lasted 11 days, the longest here in decades, and turned life upside down for families across the nation\u2019s third-largest school district.\n\nIn the end, the clash between the teachers and Chicago\u2019s new mayor, Lori Lightfoot, appeared to have brought mixed results. The city agreed to spend millions of dollars on reducing class sizes; promised to pay for hundreds more social workers, nurses and librarians; and approved a 16 percent salary increase over the coming five years. But not all union members were satisfied; a vote to approve a tentative deal was noticeably split, and some teachers wanted to press on to seek steeper reductions in class sizes, more teacher preparation time and aid for special education.\n\nStill, the strike in Chicago, which followed a series of major teacher walkouts in conservative states like West Virginia and Oklahoma as well as liberal cities like Los Angeles and Denver, reflected a renewed wave of activism from teachers.\n\n\u201cWhat it says is that West Virginia and Oklahoma wasn\u2019t sui generis; it wasn\u2019t an isolated moment,\u201d said Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers , who made several trips to Chicago during the strike. \u201cThis is now a strategy.\u201d", "title": "Chicago Teachers\u2019 Strike, Longest in Decades, Ends", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Chicago']"}, {"id": 60, "city": "Chicago", "url": "https://www.nrdc.org/experts/chicago-tackle-congestion-and-transportation-inequity", "text": "Mayor Lightfoot recently introduced one of the country\u2019s most ambitious and equitably structured proposals to price ride-hailing trips, underscoring the city\u2019s commitment to reducing congestion and investing in high-quality transit service for residents all across Chicago.\n\nThe proposal is designed to reduce congestion and improve bus service by increasing taxes on all ride-hailing trips in Chicago\u2019s congested core, and on non-shared ride-hailing trips throughout the city. The city plans to reinvest a portion of the revenues into making bus service more reliable to improve transportation options for all Chicagoans and turn around declining bus ridership.\n\nWith the Mayor\u2019s proposal, high-income residents are likely to bear much of the fiscal impact. The ride-hailing passengers who will see the biggest price increases will be those who choose to travel by car alone in the downtown zone. Shared rides taken outside the downtown zone, late at night, or on weekends will see a price drop.\n\nThe borders of the downtown zone that will be affected by Mayor Lightfoot\u2019s plan. City of Chicago\n\nIt has been a well-publicized fact that gridlock in Chicago is getting worse, with vehicle slowdowns experienced citywide, including a recent spike downtown where average speeds decreased by 2.3 percent from 2016 to 2017. There are a number of factors that contribute to traffic congestion, with the relatively recent ascent of the ride-hailing industry being one of them. Over the last three years, the city reported a record 271 percent increase in the use of ride-hailing trips offered by Transportation Network Provider (TNP) companies like Uber, Lyft, and Via. Although Chicago residents have had greater access to the city since the introduction of these services, their growth has also contributed to significant increases in traffic congestion and air pollution in the city.\n\nThe Mayor\u2019s proposal makes even more sense when taking a closer look at the detailed report on the effects of TNP companies on congestion recently released by the city. Nearly half of all ride-hailing trips begin or end in the downtown zone, with only 20 percent of these trips requested as shared trips. This competes with cleaner, more efficient transportation options such as the train, bus, bike, or walking, and contributes to poorer air quality and more congestion. As one of the 25 Bloomberg American Cities Climate Challenge cities, Chicago is taking a leadership role in addressing these negative environmental and social impacts.\n\nHow Mayor Lightfoot\u2019s Proposal Addresses Congestion Head-On\n\nMayor Lightfoot\u2019s proposal would create a \u201cdowntown zone surcharge\u201d that will be added to both shared and non-shared rides in the downtown zone. Currently, the ground transportation tax sits at $0.60 for all rides, independent of place or time. The surcharge will be added to rides on weekdays from 6am to 10pm, during which time traffic congestion is at its worst downtown. Shared rides starting or ending in the downtown zone will be assessed a $1.13 total tax during surge times, and non-shared rides a total tax of $2.88. Outside the downtown zone, shared ride taxes will decrease to $0.53, while non-shared rides will be assessed $1.13. For TNP users choosing non-shared rides outside the downtown zone, there will be an 88% increase in the ground transportation tax under the proposed fee structure.\n\nYet passengers will benefit from an almost 12% reduction in the ground transportation tax for shared rides outside of the downtown zone -- providing an important equity benefit to city residents. This is especially important for riders on the South and West sides, where nine out of ten trips go from neighborhood to neighborhood, never entering (nor contributing to congestion in) the downtown zone. Half of these are also requested as shared rides, significantly higher than the city\u2019s average ride-sharing rate. The city reported that only five percent of the rides to Englewood go downtown -- out of 400,000 annual trips.\n\nA few existing special cases will be preserved. Ride taxes for Chicago \u201cSpecial surcharge zones,\u201d McCormick Place, Navy Pier, and O\u2019Hare and Midway airports will remain the same at $5.00 per ride. This proposed tax increase will not affect Wheelchair Accessible Vehicles, nor will they be subject to the downtown zone surcharge.\n\nTaken together, these changes will incentivize customers to share rides in Chicago while at the same time investing in the city\u2019s bus system, a more reliable and efficient alternative to driving.\n\nFewer Cars; Faster, More Reliable Buses\n\nThis increased tax on TNPs will fund much needed public transportation improvements, making bus service in particular more reliable and accessible to Chicago residents.\n\n$2 million of the funds raised by Mayor Lightfoot\u2019s proposal will be allotted to improving priority bus lanes in the city. ReanC / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe city projects that the proposed congestion pricing will generate over $40 million annually. About $2 million of these funds will be allotted to improving seven priority bus lanes on Chicago\u2019s South and West sides, areas with some of Chicago\u2019s highest-ridership bus routes. These include Halsted Street (#8), Western Avenue (#49), Pulaski Road (#53), 63rd Street (#63), Chicago Avenue (#66), Belmont Avenue (#77) and 79th Street (#79). Access to fast, frequent, affordable, and reliable public transportation is vital to Chicago\u2019s communities. This proposal addresses the challenges many Chicagoans face with limited access to transportation options and unreliable service and demonstrates Mayor Lightfoot\u2019s commitment to making transit work better in communities that need it most.\n\nEquity in Access to Transportation\n\nThe city has been working continuously to ensure that residents of Chicago have equitable access to transportation in the city, and the Mayor\u2019s recent proposal is part of a larger strategy designed to improve affordable, high-quality, low-emission transportation options and reduce congestion. The proposal also aligns with Mayor Lightfoot\u2019s platform for Equitable and Efficient Transit.\n\nThis year, CTA increased the frequency of bus routes, specifically for those traveling to the South side of Chicago. Their proposed budget for 2020 includes a $310 million dollar investment for the Red Line Extension project. The Red Line Extension project will extend the Red Line 5.3 miles south adding four new, fully accessible stations at 103rd Street, 111th Street, Michigan Avenue, and 130th Street. The project will cost about $2.3 billion total.\n\nFurther, the city\u2019s bikeshare network, Divvy, is expanding their access to bikes into the Far North and South sides. By 2021, more than double the current number of bikes will be added to all 50 Chicago wards. 30 new stations will also be added to the neighborhoods of Roseland, Chatham, Morgan Park, Beverly, Washington Heights, Pullman and Auburn Gresham, to hold a total of over 500 new pedal bikes.\n\nMoving Forward\n\nThe path to a cleaner, less congested, and more equitable transportation future requires a bold vision and strong leadership.

As I\u2019ve written, both Lightfoot and her opponent, Cook County board president Toni Preckwinkle, had generally progressive positions on walking, biking, and transit issues.\n\nBut Lightfoot, a former federal prosecutor, took more sustainable-transportation-friendly stances on dedicated bike/walk funding, the North Lake Shore Drive reconstruction, camera enforcement of bus lanes, and reduced transit fares for low-income Chicagoans.\n\nShe also published a thoughtful and forward-thinking transportation platform that included many of the ideas I might have included if I had written it myself, and cited Streetsblog Chicago as a source.

They\u2019ve also stressed the need to hold her accountable for following through on these promises despite the car-centric headwinds she will surely encounter.\n\n\u201cThe election is over and Mayor-elect Lightfoot must quickly get to work building a transportation network in which everyone can get where they need to go,\u201d wrote Active Trans\u2019 Kyle Whitehead in a blog post today. \u201cAs mayor, Lori Lightfoot can reduce traffic crashes and ease congestion by making it easier to get around without driving or riding alone in a car.\u201d\n\nThis morning Freemark, a former Metropolitan Planning Council employee who currently lives in Boston, tweeted out a condensed list of Lightfoot\u2019s transportation pledges (which helped inspire this post), and had this advice for Chicago residents:\n\nThese are big ideas that will be controversial for some. It is up to Chicagoans to push Lightfoot to ensure that she sticks to these plans. As Chicago\u2019s mayor she\u2019ll control both the streets (CDOT) and transit (CTA)\u2014so she has the ability to make these things happen. \u2014 Yonah Freemark (@yfreemark) April 3, 2019\n\nRest assured, Streetsblog Chicago will be here to remind Lightfoot of her promises to help create a safer, more efficient, more equitable, and more vibrant transportation system; cheerlead her accomplishments in this area; and, if necessary, call out her administration when the plans get off track.

A resident of Chicago\u2019s South Shore neighborhood who looks forward to benefiting from the jobs juggernaut of the O\u2019Hare terminal modernization would have to stomach a 90-minute transit commute each way.\n\nAt the same time, gridlock in the Loop is getting worse. While ride-share companies like Uber and Lyft generated about 2 million trips locally each month back in 2015, that number grew to 9 million trips each month in 2018. And almost half of those solo riders are taking short trips between the Loop and North Side where transit is often plentiful, adding to hassles and delays for walkers, bikers and drivers.\n\nThere are no easy fixes to increasing transportation mobility, accessibility and equity. But there are promising steps Mayor Lightfoot can take, even in her first 100 days. Many are detailed in three bold transportation blueprints, including one issued just this March. Two ideas that can be championed immediately by the Lightfoot administration: rewarding businesses that encourage transit use and helping transit commuters who need it most.\n\nFirst up, fairer fares. CTA offers discounted rides for children, students, the elderly and people with disabilities. There are no price breaks for low-income individuals. Last year, MPC released \"Our Equitable Future,\" a policy road map to increase equity and inclusion.\n\nOne recommendation, a 50 percent transit fare subsidy for adults living below the federal poverty line (10 to 15 percent of transit riders), would cost $25 million to $50 million annually, but the return on investment to our regional economy could be even bigger.

MUST WATCH Chicago police chief: What more is it going to take? 00:54\n\nThe hearing brought together city officials, doctors, and those personally affected by the issue, many of whom agreed with California Rep. Anna Eshoo's suggestion that the violence is a public health emergency.\n\nChicago Pastor Brenda Mitchell, who lost her brother and her son to gun violence, spoke during the meeting.\n\n\"We have children in Chicago who aren't worried about growing up to be a doctor or lawyer, they're worrying about growing up, period,\" she said.\n\n'He was a gentle soul'\n\nDespite the overall improvements in Chicago's crime statistics, there are hundreds of families whose lives have been irretrievably changed by the violence.\n\nDemetrius Flowers, 33, was among the seven killed and more than 50 wounded over a single weekend in August. The father of three was set to be married on August 23.\n\nPictures and memories are all Keith Flowers has left of his son.\n\nThe night his son was shot, Flowers rushed to the hospital, where he was told to wait. He feared the worst. Then, even after his son was pronounced dead, Flowers said he wasn't able to see him until days later. It still haunts him.\n\n\"He was back there alone. There wasn't nobody holding his hand. He couldn't see his mama, he couldn't see his father,\" said Flowers, fighting back tears. \"Nobody cared enough for a black young youth... to die alone like that like he was an enemy of the state.\"\n\n'It doesn't stop'\n\nFor hospital employees, it's become a predictable cycle. During nighttime hours and on weekends, they can almost anticipate an influx of patients. Dr. Faran Bokhari is the director of Trauma and Burns Surgery at Stroger Hospital in Chicago.\n\nAmong his patients are people shot by handguns and those wounded by firearms that do even greater damage.\n\n\"You have very large injuries, parts of bodies are missing, and that's the patient you're left to resuscitate,\" said Bokhari.\n\nIn some cases, it's not only the nature of the wounds, but also the sheer number of patients that at times can overwhelm a hospital's resources. On the same early morning that Demetrius Flowers was killed, Mount Sinai Hospital on Chicago's west side had to temporarily stop accepting patients because they were at capacity following a series of shootings.\n\nIt was the same hospital Flowers was taken to just before the hospital went \"on bypass.\"\n\n'What we're seeing are crimes that are precipitated by a lack of investment'\n\nWhat remains to be seen is if the improved crime stats are the beginning of a long-term trend, or if they're just a temporary dip.\n\nMayor Lightfoot is the first to admit there's still more work to be done, and she says a long-term solution isn't just going to come from police on the ground.\n\n\"Our law enforcement partners from federal, state, and local obviously have a role to play, but it's got to be a much more holistic approach,\" said Lightfoot. \"What we're seeing are crimes that are precipitated by a lack of investment, a lack of hope, a lack of connectivity to legitimate economy. You're not going to solve those deep systemic problems by just putting more police on the street.\"\n\nIn some cases, officials point to something as simple as having more data being a tremendous step in the right direction. Dr. Jay Shannon is the CEO of the Cook County Health System, which covers Chicago. He says more federal resources are needed to move toward a solution.\n\n\"We had a scare about Ebola a few years ago, tens of millions of dollars poured into research funding around that. Four Americans ... contracted Ebola,\" said Shannon. \"We've got a condition here that's killing almost 40,000 Americans each year and we don't have a nickel of federally funded research to address it.\"\n\nPart of what he's referring to is the so-called \"Dickey Amendment,\" passed in 1996, that restricted funds for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from being used to advocate or promote gun control. Critics of the amendment say it ultimately led to the CDC halting gun violence research.\n\nOn the policy side, Lightfoot said there is only so much she can do within her city.\n\n\"If you can drive across to Indiana and buy military-grade firearms and bring them back to Chicago without anyone knowing, without any background checks, that's a problem. And the only way to solve that problem is for Congress to step up and do its job.\"\n\nAs policy debates play out both in Chicago and Washington, wounded patients continue to come into the city's hospitals day after day, night after night. \"Oh, it doesn't stop,\" said Bokhari.", "title": "The decreasing crime numbers in Chicago are little comfort to families impacted by violence", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "['crime', 'trend', 'city-wide']", "annot_city": "['Chicago']"}, {"id": 64, "city": "Chicago", "url": "https://www.chicagobusiness.com/news/chicago-still-losing-population", "text": "So who\u2019s winning? The fastest-growing metropolitan statistical areas were Austin, Texas; Orlando, Fla.; Las Vegas; Raleigh, N.C.; and Phoenix\u2014which grew between 2 and 2.5 percent. The fastest growth among all metro areas was in the oil patch of Texas: Midland grew 4.3 percent. Odessa, Texas, was fifth-fastest at 3.2 percent. The fastest-growing county of more than 20,000 was Williams County, N.D., another hot spot for oil exploration, where the population grew 5.9 percent last year to 35,350.\n\nIn Illinois, Danville, which has struggled with a steady decline in manufacturing and population for more than a generation, registered the fourth-worst decline among the nation\u2019s metro areas, losing 1.2 percent. Peoria also was hard-hit, which lost 0.9 percent. The sharpest decline in Illinois was in Alexander County, at the southern tip of the state, which lost 3.8 percent of its residents. Its population is down 26 percent since 2010 to just 6,060 people.\n\nRACIAL FACTORS\n\nThe population decline in Chicago and the state, which started shrinking a year earlier than the metro area, has provided a gloomy backdrop to an already-contentious climate in which political leaders are wrestling with tax increases and service cuts to deal with a fiscal mess caused by pension obligations that have been neglected for nearly a generation.\n\nCity-level estimates aren't yet available. But, based on recent trends, demographers suspect that Chicago continues to suffer from a declining African-American population in the city and an exodus of older, white residents in Cook County suburbs. \u201cIf there was a stable black population, the city and the county would be growing,\u201d Paral says.\n\nA CITY OF IMMIGRANTS?\n\nWhile the debate over immigration rages in Washington, it\u2019s hitting home in Chicago and other large cities. Since 2010, international immigration to Chicago has dropped by more than half, to roughly 200,000, estimates the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning. Between 2000 and 2010, it was about 440,000.\n\nThat\u2019s a big deal to a region where 1 in 5 workers are foreign-born.\n\n\u201cChicago has the lowest international immigration rate among its peer metropolitan areas, albeit international immigration to these now-shrinking regions has generally stagnated in more recent years,\u201d the agency says. Two exceptions are Boston and Philadelphia, both of which showed overall growth last year, and have since recovered and surpassed their pre-recession immigration rates.\n\n\u201cChicago has returned to pre-recession domestic outmigration rates. Our peers haven\u2019t,\u201d said Aseal Tineh, an associate policy analyst for CMAP.\n\nLast year, CMAP estimates 25,000 international migrants came to Chicago, compared with 38,000 international migrants in 2005. When it comes to immigration, each city is unique. Chicago has felt the impact of a decline in the U.S.-Mexico relationship and an improved economy in Eastern Europe.\n\nMexican immigrants made up 41 percent of Chicago\u2019s foreign-born population. By 2017, they were 37 percent, according to CMAP.\n\nIn 2017, the Chicago region was home to 630,000 Mexican-born residents, 40,000 fewer than in 2005, CMAP says. \u201cThe decline in Mexican immigration has contributed to the overall stagnation in international immigration to the region.\u201d\n\nThat impacts Chicago in another key way, says Johnson. \u201cBirth rates are down 10 percent from a decade ago, even though there are more women of childbearing age. Among Hispanic women in their early 20s, birth rates are down 40 percent.\u201d\n\nThe Asian-born population in Chicago is up to 29 percent from 23.4 percent in 2005. But the European-born segment has dropped from 24.6 percent to 21.4 percent. Paral estimates the number of Polish immigrants to Illinois has fallen by half since 2000. \u201cDuring the '80s and '90s, the city and state had huge immigration, so there was overall growth,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s changed.\u201d\n\nThis story has been corrected to show the population of 14-county metropolitan area, not Cook County, fell below 9.5 million for the first time.", "title": "Chicago is still losing population", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Chicago']"}, {"id": 65, "city": "Chicago", "url": "https://chicago.curbed.com/2019/3/22/18277352/best-month-to-rent-chicago", "text": "Conventional wisdom suggests that it\u2019s cheaper to rent in the winter compared to the summer.

The same holds true for families wanting to avoid the disruption of moving during the academic school year. These renters often tend to stick to the same annual lease renewal schedule.\n\nBased on 2018 median rental prices, the study concluded that the peak differentials for Chicago one- and two-bedroom apartments equate to $80 and $176 per month, respectively. So is it worth it to try to time your move and capitalize on the winter lull? It depends.\n\nWhile demand for apartments dips during the colder months, often so does the supply. You might pay slightly less, but you may have fewer options from which to choose, Curbed\u2019s Jeff Andrews explains. The lower rents offered during a down period can be a consideration, but probably not be the deciding factor behind your move.\n\n\u201cWe always tell people you shouldn\u2019t try to time the market,\u201d says Aaron Terrazas, Zillow\u2019s director of economic research. \u201cYou should move or buy a home because big life changes are happening\u2014you need an extra bedroom because you\u2019re having a kid, [or] you\u2019re retiring and moving to a different climate. Those are the reasons to move, not because of a couple dollars difference in timing the market.\u201d", "title": "The best and worst times to rent in Chicago", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Chicago']"}, {"id": 66, "city": "Chicago", "url": "https://www.rcreader.com/commentary/causes-effects-chicago-murder-rate", "text": "The Chicago Police Department reported last week that the number of people murdered in the city fell 10 percent during the first four months of 2019 compared to last year during the same period.\n\nWhile that's good news and part of a two-year downward trend, lost in much of the coverage was a worrisome murder spike in the month of April.\n\nThe Chicago Sun-Times counted 62 Chicago homicides in April, up from 37 in April of last year and 48 in April of 2017.\n\nIt's too early to tell whether this is an aberration or a trend. The city's Mayor-elect Lori Lightfoot has been busily meeting with law-enforcement officials over the past several days in an attempt to develop a plan before she takes office on May 20 and before summer starts, when street violence tends to increase as the weather warms.\n\nGovernor JB Pritzker spent over a year on the campaign trail talking about his strong belief that violence is a public-health issue. I happen to agree with him on this. We cannot police ourselves completely out of this problem. Violence often spreads like a disease and research has shown when it's treated as such, the contagion can be slowed or even halted.\n\nAs an integral part of treating violence as a public health issue, Pritzker touted his support for violence-interruption programs, which do things such as mediate conflicts between rival individuals and groups and try to prevent retaliations from spiraling out of control.\n\nAfter then-Governor Bruce Rauner blamed the city's crime problem on the lack of jobs and even illegal immigrants, Pritzker countered during a debate last October by laying at least some of the blame at Rauner's feet.\n\n\"Gun violence across the state of Illinois has gone up in the very same period that Governor Rauner refused to compromise on a budget,\" Pritzker said during the debate. \"So many of the violence interruption services, human services that people have as their last vestige of connection with civilization, have gone away.\"\n\nIndeed, the General Assembly had appropriated $4.7 million for violence interruption programs in Fiscal Year 2015, Rauner's first year in office. But Governor Rauner stopped spending that money and then nothing was appropriated for the following fiscal year, which began July 1.\n\nShootings spiked almost immediately.\n\nIn all of 2014, before Governor Rauner took office, 415 people were murdered in Chicago. Rauner, who didn't recognize the connection between violence and public health, was inaugurated in January of 2015 and the number of murders rose to 468.\n\nThe city saw another huge increase in violence in 2016, with murders soaring to 750.\n\nBut violence-prevention funding was mostly restored after taxes were raised over Rauner's July 2017 veto. The murder rate began to decline, dropping to 650.\n\nNot all of this trend can be attributed to violence interruption services, of course. But the one Chicago community that managed to secure non-state violence interruption funding in 2015 was the only one spared from that year's bloody surge in killings.\n\nOn his first full day in office this past January, Governor Pritzker told reporters he wanted to expand violence-interruption programs.\n\n\"Those programs have been decimated across the state. And so we should be focusing on interrupting violence as much as possible,\" the governor said.\n\nAnd as he approached his first 100 days in office, Pritzker told ABC 7's Craig Wall: \"The fact is violence-interruption programs addressing the issues that prevent violence before it occurs, that's the most effective thing that we can do.\"\n\nPritzker also touted an increase in anti-violence funding during his February budget address. \"This budget adds funds for community-based violence interruption,\" he told lawmakers.\n\nThe governor never actually said how much he was proposing to add to the program, but it turns out his requested increase is a mere $2 million.\n\nEvery little bit helps, obviously, and nobody is complaining yet, but the money doesn't appear to match the governor's soaring rhetoric.\n\nWhen I asked the administration why more wasn't appropriated, I was told there just isn't enough available state money to go around to fund all of the things the governor wants to do, ergo his push for a graduated income tax.\n\nPritzker is right that these programs work, and Chicago isn't the only Illinois city that has benefited from them over the years. Somehow, we need to find a way to do more.\n\nRich Miller also publishes Capitol Fax, a daily political newsletter, and CapitolFax.com.", "title": "Causes and Effects of Chicago's Murder Rate", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "['crime', 'murder', 'city-wide']", "annot_city": "['Chicago']"}, {"id": 67, "city": "Chicago", "url": "https://chicago.suntimes.com/crossroads/2019/9/20/20870524/climate-change-chicago-global-warming-trends-ed-zotti-city-crossroads", "text": "After a January of near-record cold and a rainy, chilly spring followed by a summer of mostly moderate temperatures, Chicagoans might be thinking: This isn\u2019t the global warming scenario we were led to expect \u2014 that it\u2019s going to get really hot:\n\nAs the city\u2019s Chicago Climate Action Plan website says of climate change: \u201cThe most obvious change to come could be hotter summers and more frequent and intense heat waves. Hot days could feel even hotter because of higher humidity. More heat waves will mean more heat-related illness and deterioration in the quality of air we breathe.\u201d\n\nThe plan, published in 2008, says: \u201cA Chicago summer late in this century could feel like that of Mobile, Alabama, today. By the end of the century, the number of extremely hot days (over 100\u00b0F) could increase from the current two days per year to as many as 31 days per year.\u201d\n\nThe Union of Concerned Scientists echoes that: \u201cScientists project that heat-related deaths [in Chicago] are likely to quadruple by 2050. An event like the deadly 1995 heat wave could occur three times a year by the end of this century.\u201d\n\nOther than climate-change deniers, no one is saying such things won\u2019t happen eventually. Chicago and the entire country indisputably are getting warmer, especially over the past 20 years. But the changes are playing out in unexpected ways that, in some respects, are at odds with what\u2019s happening nationwide.\n\nThe chart below shows how the average annual daily high temperature in Chicago, as measured at Midway Airport since 1928, departs from the long-term norm compared to the United States overall, based on data from the Midwestern Regional Climate Center at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration\u2019s National Centers for Environmental Information.\n\nDaily highs have been rising in Chicago and nationally \u2014 but U.S. highs are rising faster. Beginning in 1998, the yearly average high temperature nationally has been above normal every single year.\n\nNot so in Chicago. The city continues to have colder-than-normal years every so often, though less frequently than it once did.\n\nThe next chart shows the average annual daily low temperature for Chicago vs. the nation.\n\nThis chart tells a much different story. Daily lows in Chicago have been rising much faster than nationally \u2014 a trend that began in the 1980s. Since 1986, Chicago lows have been above normal most years, often outpacing the country as a whole by a wide margin.\n\nTo put it another way, the United States is warming up a little faster than Chicago during the day \u2014 but Chicago is warming up much faster than the country as a whole at night.\n\nThe shift was especially dramatic between 1982, the last in a string of cold years in Chicago, and the unusually warm year of 1998 \u2014 by more than seven degrees.\n\nIt\u2019s as if someone threw on an extra blanket. And, in a way, that\u2019s what happened. Illinois state climatologist Trent Ford attributes the unexpected warming trend in Chicago and the Midwest generally to higher humidity and more cloud cover. During the day, clouds act as an umbrella, limiting solar heating. At night, they act as a blanket, preventing the warmth from radiating away.\n\nChicago\u2019s climate tracks most closely with the national trend in winter. During cold-weather months, the city sees greater swings in average temperature from year to year than is true of the entire country, but the city and the nation are warming up at similar rates.\n\nSummers are another matter. Here\u2019s the trend for summertime lows:\n\nAnd here\u2019s the trend for summertime highs:\n\nSeveral things jump out.\n\nThe national trend is flat \u2014 summertime highs, on average, have changed little in the United States the past 90 years.\n\nFluctuations in summertime highs in Chicago, always greater than for the U.S. overall, became more extreme starting in 1983, and the extremes began occurring more frequently.\n\nSeemingly at odds with the experts\u2019 predictions, the trend in Chicago\u2019s summertime highs is down.\n\nThat Chicago has largely dodged the global warming bullet doesn\u2019t mean our luck will hold indefinitely.\n\n\u201cThe lack of an upward trend in summer max temperature and projections of more frequent heat waves in Chicago seem paradoxical,\u201d Ford says. \u201cHowever, climate change works in a non-linear fashion. What we experience today and the changes we\u2019ve seen over the last several decades aren\u2019t necessarily good indicators of what\u2019s to come.\n\n\u201cSo it\u2019s entirely credible to state two facts: First, summertime maximum temperatures in Chicago haven\u2019t increased appreciably over the last several decades. And, second, state-of-the-art climate-model projections show considerable increases in the frequency and intensity of summertime extreme heat in Chicago over the next century.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s why things could start getting a lot worse. As the charts show, Chicago has had some exceptionally hot summers since 1983. What was different about the killer heat wave of 1995 was that, in contrast to other hot summers, the daily highs and lows both were much warmer than the norm, with high humidity. During the hottest stretch, the temperature didn\u2019t drop even at night. That\u2019s why so many \u2014 700 \u2014 died.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t bode well. Two trends are at work.\n\nChicago\u2019s overnight lows are steadily rising.\n\nAnd sharp increases in summertime highs, though still relatively rare, are becoming more common.\n\nIf those trends continue, hot summer days will be followed more often by hot summer nights.\n\nWe\u2019re not there yet. Despite a slow start and some hot days, this summer turned out to be delightful, with plenty of sun, moderate humidity and a pleasant mix of temperatures, hot days followed by cooler ones.\n\nStill, the common view among climate scientists is that we face an unpleasant future in Chicago and worldwide. We need to prepare for the worst \u2014 and hope we continue to avoid it.\n\nThis is part of the series City at the Crossroads by journalist Ed Zotti, who looks in-depth at trends affecting Chicago and critical choices the city faces.\n\nEmail comments to: letters@suntimes.com.", "title": "Climate change in Chicago isn\u2019t playing out exactly as it has been nationwide \u2014 not yet", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Chicago']"}, {"id": 68, "city": "Chicago", "url": "https://chicago.suntimes.com/2019/10/21/20925766/chicago-neighborhoods-250-million-investment-south-west-sides-lightfoot", "text": "Chicago will spend $250 million over the next three years to bring \u201ctransformative change\u201d to ten South and West Side neighborhoods \u201cstarving for too long,\u201d Mayor Lori Lightfoot said Monday.\n\n\u201cWe are bringing the whole of government to these efforts. ...

We want to have a comprehensive plan that really brings communities together and builds upon the infrastructure that\u2019s already there,\u201d the mayor said.\n\n\u201cAustin and a lot of other neighborhoods across the city have done community, quality-of-life plans, but they\u2019ve been on a shelf because there hasn\u2019t been the resources to bring those projects to life. We want to change that.\u201d\n\nIn July, Lightfoot wrapped up a neighborhood listening tour by promising \u201ctransformative\u201d investments in the long-neglected South and West sides.\n\nShe reiterated that promise after a ceremony marking the 100th anniversary of the 1919 Chicago race riots, a \u201cbitter and shameful chapter\u201d that, she claimed, represents not only Chicago\u2019s past, but its present.\n\nOn Monday, the mayor finally got around to launching her \u201cMarshall Plan.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have been chomping at the bit for months to be able to stand here in this moment.

Earlier this month John, Joe, and the Reader released the Simplified, Citywide Mellow Chicago Bike Map, which goes to the city limits and beyond.\n\nThe Illustrated version of the map is available as a two-page centerfold in the current issue of the free paper, which is available at these locations through the afternoon of Thursday, July 24, at these distribution locations around Chicago. The SCMCBM is also available as a much more detailed Google Map for laptop or smartphone navigation. Here\u2019s the backstory of how the new version of the map came to be.\n\nThe need for a good Chicago bike map has never been greater.\n\nAs I write this, our city is in Phase Four reopening after being devastated by COVID-19, and workplaces have opened their doors again. CTA ridership fell by 80 percent during the pandemic, and many Chicagoans are still avoiding transit, so if we don\u2019t provide safe alternatives to cars for socially distanced trips, we\u2019re sure to see a serious spike in driving, congestion, pollution, and traffic deaths.\n\nFor months now, peer cities across the country and around the world have been taking action to facilitate safe, socially distanced walking and biking and prevent future carmageddon by repurposing parking and travel lanes to widen sidewalks and create emergency bus and bike lanes. There\u2019s also a nationwide movement to create \u201cSlow Streets,\u201d residential roadways where through traffic is banned so people can safely walk, roll, jog, and bike in the street, creating corridors for transportation and recreation. That\u2019s crucial, because the United States is currently seeing a major biking boom.\n\nChicago was late to the party, having done almost nothing to make more room for walking, transit, and cycling during the first few months of the crisis. Meanwhile, Mayor Lori Lightfoot closed the Lakefront Trail and the 606 for about three months, eliminating about 21.5 miles of car-free commuting corridors.\n\nThankfully those key corridors have reopened with restrictions, and the city has been gradually rolling out several miles of Slow Streets in neighborhoods like South Shore, Kenwood-Oakland, Bucktown, Logan Square, and Ravenswood. But we\u2019re still way behind other U.S. cities. For example, Oakland, California, with a fraction of the population of Chicago, is doing 74 miles of Slow Streets, many times more than our city.\n\nBut rather than curse the darkness, we at the Reader decided to light a candle by speeding up the release of the citywide version of our Mellow Chicago Bike Map, which originally covered the area bounded by 95th, Cicero, Devon, and Lake Michigan. This new version stretches from Morgan Park to Rogers Park, Edison Park to Hegewisch, offering low-stress alternative routes, mostly on side streets.\n\nThey\u2019re ideal for people from all over town who want to try biking as a socially distanced way to get around that\u2019s also healthy, affordable, good for the environment, and super fun. But even seasoned cyclists will appreciate these quiet, serene roadways where shade offers relief from the summer heat.\n\nIf you\u2019re in a hurry and need more direct routes, the city of Chicago\u2019s official bike map is useful for finding marked bikeways on main streets. To avoid clutter on this larger edition of the map, it doesn\u2019t include the points of interest and restaurant and bar recommendations from the original central-city version, but you can still view those at tinyurl.com/MellowChicagoMap.\n\nWhile I think these routes are generally better for bicyclists, you still should be careful anytime you ride in the city. Feel free to drop me a line with any suggestions for improvements or additions at jgreenfield[at]streetsblog.org.\n\nSome notes:\n\n\u2014I\u2019ve tried to create a grid of low-stress north-south and east-west routes within the city of Chicago, spaced roughly a mile apart.\n\n\u2014To keep the map from getting too cluttered, main-street bikeways, including most diagonal streets, generally aren\u2019t shown\u2014check out the city\u2019s map for these.\n\n\u2014Some routes include a short stretch of sidewalk, or a block where you might have to ride the wrong way on a one-way street. To follow the letter of the law, please dismount and walk your bike at these locations.\n\nThanks to the following people who have provided feedback on drafts of this map or helped out in other ways: Anne Alt, Elihu Blanks, Shawn Conley, Jeremy Cuebas, Marissa Dolin, Angela Ford, Carolina Gallo, David Griggs, Anna Gunderson, Katherine Hodges, Paul Fitzgerald, Ronnie Matthew Harris, Paul Halupka, Derrick James, Howard Kaplan, Gin Kilgore, Lynda Lopez, Deloris Lucas, Jake Malooley, Danielle McKinney, Beth Medley, Jacob Peters, James Porter, Anjulie Rao, Eric Allix Rogers, Bill Savage, Yasmeen Schuller, Brian Sobolak, Charlie Short, Peter Taylor, Steven Vance, Vera Videnovich, and Jeff Zoline.

Residents living in the Streeterville community live to be 90, but just 9 miles away in Englewood, residents only live to be 60, the report found.\n\nThanks to our sponsors: View all sponsors\n\nAs startling as that figure is, it\u2019s not news, says Dr. David Ansell, a primary care physician and senior vice president for community health at Rush University. \u201cWe\u2019ve known this for years, and it\u2019s just now gotten the attention of the public and others. That 30-year (life expectancy) age gap has been known for a long time,\u201d he said.\n\nA similar report was released last year, when the group West Side United announced a 16-year life expectancy gap between residents of West Garfield Park and the Loop. The group is made up of a coalition of local health care institutions and professionals, including Rush.\n\nAnsell says health outcomes are not strictly a result of biology, behavior or beliefs. \u201cSocial conditions themselves \u2026 create these terrible gaps in disease and premature mortality.\u201d Those health inequities are the subject of a new book co-authored by Ansell that details nearly a century of research on how Chicago\u2019s structural and socioeconomic inequalities have impacted patients and hospitals.\n\nWhile many people believe the term \u201chealth equity\u201d means equal access to care, it actually means everyone has an equal opportunity to be healthy, according to Ansell. \u201cEvery man, woman and child should have the chance to lead a long and healthy life,\u201d he said, adding that equal access to care is an important part of that.\n\n\u201cWhat seems to be driving the large gaps in life expectancy you see in Chicago are actually differences in social conditions under which people live, play and work,\u201d he said.\n\nStructural racism, a lack of investment in communities, and concentrated poverty are examples of social and structural conditions that contribute to Chicago\u2019s health inequities. \u201cThese are forms of afflictions because in some ways they cause disease,\u201d said Ansell. \u201cThere are solutions to them, but it\u2019s not just health care alone.\u201d\n\nWest Side United is one such effort to address health inequities. It launched last year to address social and structural determinants of health on the West Side.

Scientific research, opinion pieces, political speechmaking and the global marketplace are all speaking loudly. The question is how? At what pace? At what cost?\n\nAnd despite all the talk, the real leadership will be shown through actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while also meeting the growing global demand for energy.\n\nHouston and Texas must embrace a new mantle - Sustainable Energy Capital of the World, the place where new technologies and new policies are put into practice. This only makes sense: Texas not only produces the oil, natural gas, transportation fuels and plastics that allow the nation to thrive, but Texas also has the infrastructure in place - pipelines, transmission lines, storage tanks, rail and port access - that will be required if we are to transform carbon emissions into viable commercial products.\n\nTexas contributes significantly to the energy mix and products demanded by modern life. Globally the economic uplifting of entire countries and the continued growth of population and prosperity means that demand for energy and material goods will continue to grow, and we must ensure that these products remain affordable and become more environmentally friendly. The solution will largely fall to the energy industries in the states and countries that produce energy to embrace this future as an opportunity.\n\nOn HoustonChronicle.com: Renewables presence expands at OTC\n\nThat means Houston, and Texas, will be critical to success. And we have the good fortune to have forward-thinking, global energy companies that recognize this coming change. Virtually all of them have a strong presence in Houston.\n\nTexans know renewables are important, today and for the future, as the state produces more wind-generated electricity than all but six countries. The amount of solar is growing rapidly. We must strategically integrate all sources of renewables and promote electrification via clean sources of energy. This is not simply good for the environment - it will offer benefits to consumers and create value for the industries.\n\nTexas also consumes twice as much oil, gas and coal as any other state, by virtue of our large manufacturing base, so it falls to us to create this transformation to a low-carbon future.\n\nThis transformation will require more than the efficient and lower carbon production and generation of energy. For example, Texas has led the country in the integration of industry with infrastructure and demonstrated how to reduce and capture CO2 emissions in a way that is both cost-effective and useful, storing carbon dioxide in geologic formations and using it for enhanced oil recovery.\n\nCarbon Capture Utilization and Storage (CCUS) has been practiced for over 50 years in Texas, used both in the Permian and East Texas for enhanced oil recovery with great success. There are challenges and opportunities for methane, as well. The primary component of natural gas, methane is also a valuable fuel and feedstock for petrochemicals.\n\nWe must invest in transformative technologies that will allow us to view carbon and methane as not simply a waste to be disposed of, but an opportunity to lead the nation in both eliminating emissions and creating value.\n\nThat won\u2019t happen on its own. It will require new policies promoting investment and restructuring of the marketplace. We must all work to create a new energy ecosystem, not just new technologies to capture emissions, but to also produce lower-carbon fuels and products that can be differentiated and compete globally. It is not about choosing the \u201cright\u201d technology or product, but about incorporating all forms of fuels and technologies for both renewable and hydrocarbon-based energy while also lowering emissions.\n\nOn HoustonChronicle.com: Giant sucking sound: Technology removes carbon from atmosphere\n\nTexas must embrace this immense opportunity to leverage our universities, energy companies and marketplace to take advantage of our world-leading energy infrastructure. If we get it right, we can become a playbook for the rest of the world. We can walk the talk here and accelerate the transformation that will benefit everyone.\n\nThere is no more important global challenge, no more important time and no more important place than Houston. Real sustainability requires meeting the growing global demand for energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions significantly, as well as assuring energy is affordable and reliable for all. Houston and Texas must become the Sustainable Energy Capital of the World.\n\nFuel Fix: Get energy news sent directly to your inbox\n\nCharles McConnell, a longtime energy executive and former U.S. Assistant Secretary of Energy, is executive director of the Center for Carbon Management in Energy at the University of Houston.", "title": "How to make Houston the sustainable energy capital of the world", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Houston']"}, {"id": 73, "city": "Houston", "url": "https://www.houston-today.com/news/houston-residents-told-to-boil-water/", "text": "Houston residents are being told today to boil their water.\n\n\u201cAs a result of a routine water sample that resulted in a high coliform count and low chlorine residual in the District of Houston\u2019s water reservoir, a Boil Water Notice is in effect for the District of Houston water system,\u201d a press release issued today states.\n\n\u201cAll residents should bring any water intended for consumption to a roiling boil and let cool before using.

Here's why\n\nPhoenix tied its record for the longest stretch of time where temperatures never fell below 90 degrees last week. The temperature was 90 or above for seven straight days, even at night, an indicator of the impact of the urban heat island effect in combination with an increasingly warming world.\n\n\u201cWe expect to have episodes of extreme heat here every summer just based on our position on the map,\u201d said David Hondula, an Arizona State University scientist who studies heat and health. \u201cBut we are seeing over time an intensification of those heat events, we\u2019re seeing a lengthening of the summer season, and we\u2019re especially seeing a rise in nighttime temperatures.\u201d\n\nIn a highly urban desert setting like Phoenix, heat that accumulates during the day doesn\u2019t dissipate as quickly at night, keeping temperatures hot in the city throughout the night.\n\n\u201cOpen scrub desert is pretty good at radiating heat away at nighttime, but the buildings, the concrete, all the stuff around us, retains that energy and releases it more slowly,\u201d said Paul I\u00f1iguez, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. \u201cYou can only release so much energy in a finite number of hours, during nighttime, and when you start the day at 90 degrees you don't have that much further to warm up.\u201d\n\nOutlying towns and areas of open desert that are the same elevation as Phoenix can be 10 to 15 degrees cooler than the metro area at night, I\u00f1iguez said. The National Weather Service maintains temperature records that go back as far as August 1895. Since the 1980s, high nighttime temperatures have starkly increased.\n\nWHERE'S THE RAIN? After 99 days without rain, Phoenix could see monsoon storms\n\nBetween July 7 and July 15, temperatures never fell below 90 degrees and had highs in the 110s.\n\nFrom 1895 through the 1970s, Phoenix had only 9 days total where overnight lows were 90 degrees or above, I\u00f1iguez said. Since 1980, that number has shot up to 227 days where temperatures didn\u2019t fall below 90 during the summer months.\n\n\u201cThat's the big eye-catching thing, the fact that we get these 90s lows more overall now,\u201d I\u00f1iguez said. \u201cWe certainly have this shift towards warmer temperatures overall, but this rate of warming is much more drastic at night.\u201d\n\nOvernight temperatures are increasing at twice the rate as afternoon temperatures, according to NWS data analyzed by I\u00f1iguez. In 2003 and 2013, Phoenix hit its record for number of days where the temperature didn\u2019t fall below 90 in a year: 15 days total. Already, there have been 11 days this year where temperatures never dropped below 90.\n\nThe last time there were 7 days in a row where low temperatures never fell below 90 was in August of 2012.\n\nGlobal heating and urbanization are the main contributing factors to this heat trend.\n\n\u201cWe see the effect of global scale climate change both in our daytime temperatures and our nighttime temperatures,\u201d said Hondula. \u201cBut really the dominant driver here in Phoenix and many other cities in the past five, six, seven, eight decades is from urbanization and the effect of urbanization is clearest in those nighttime temperature records.\u201d\n\nThe Southwest, already the hottest and driest region in the United States, is warming at a faster rate than other parts of the country, largely because of global heating caused by human-driven greenhouse gas emissions. This gradual climate change means longer, hotter summers, experts say, as the monsoon pattern arrives later.\n\nThe urban heat island effect only intensifies that warming. During the day, the boundary layer, or the layer of air in the atmosphere closest to the ground, heats up. As the sun heats the air near the ground, that hot air warms up and rises into the boundary layer. In Phoenix during the summer, that boundary layer can become several miles thick.\n\nIt requires a tremendous amount of energy and an unusually intense combination of high pressure and dry air to get to those record temperatures, which is why Phoenix doesn\u2019t regularly break heat records, I\u00f1iguez said. The all-time record high for Phoenix remains 122 degrees on June 26, 1990.\n\n\u201cEvery year is not necessarily hotter than the past year, but the trend is very unmistakable that it's going up,\u201d I\u00f1iguez said. \u201cYou're having more of these 90 degree lows, you're having more 100 degree days, more 110 degree days, so it's this really broad warming of the system and then holding on to that overnight.\u201d\n\nThose high temperatures have serious public health impacts. That week, the burn unit at Valleywise Health saw a spike in cases.\n\n\u201cWe expect some every year but, man, our numbers this year are just high,\u201d said Kevin Foster, head of the Arizona Burn Center in Phoenix. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a few people that have laid outside so long they ended up with heat-induced brain damage and passed away. It\u2019s just terrible.\u201d\n\nMost of Foster\u2019s clients are older adults and children. About 20 percent of the people who come through the unit are homeless, he said.\n\n\u201cWith these hot sunny days, the pavement temperature can get up to 180 degrees,\u201d Foster said. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a number of kids who have tried to dash across the driveway, elderly people may fall down and can\u2019t get up. All it takes is less than a minute on pavement or black top and you get a bad burn. Almost all of these contact burns end up being third degree and almost all of them have to get into surgery and get a skin graft.\u201d\n\nPeople experiencing homelessness and drug abuse are particularly at risk, especially as the COVID-19 pandemic has forced libraries, fast food restaurants, and many cooling stations to close\u2014spaces that people living on the street rely on to cool down.\n\nThe number of facilities participating in Maricopa County\u2019s heat relief network is down some 75 percent because of the pandemic, said Hondula.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a huge reduction, which is one of the many reasons we\u2019re extra concerned about heat this summer,\u201d he said. \u201cMany buildings remain closed, and those buildings, whether it\u2019s a community center, senior center, are often filling this role as cooling centers. Our capacity to provide relief through that mechanism has taken a big hit.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, Maricopa County opened one of its vacant downtown Phoenix buildings for up to 130 people experiencing homelessness to sleep overnight during the heat of the summer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just really hard on the body to have nighttime temperatures that hot when you\u2019re trying to sleep,\u201d said Nancy Selover, the state climatologist. \u201cIt gets very difficult to sleep and very difficult to get relief for the body.\u201d\n\nThe concerns are only growing as the onset of the monsoon gets nearer.\n\n\u201cIt seems like we might be turning a corner to our monsoon, which of course is going to bring some thunderstorm activity and the potential for localized power outages,\u201d said Hondula. \u201cWe\u2019re very concerned what our heat death and illness numbers are going to look like this summer with so many other challenges happening in the world. Unfortunately it just seems like the deck is really stacked against us with the pandemic.\u201d\n\nTips to Avoid Heat-Related Illness\n\n\u00a7 Increase fluid intake regardless of activity level. Staying hydrated is extremely important.\n\n\u00a7 Limit exercise or outdoor activity between the hours of 11am and 3pm.\n\n\u00a7 When outdoors, wear a sunscreen with a minimum SPF 15 and re-apply often. Wear a hat, lightweight clothing and sunglasses.\n\n\u00a7 Rest frequently in shady or cool areas to give the body's temperature a chance to recover and cool down.\n\n\u00a7 Never leave adults, children or pets inside a parked vehicle.\n\n\u00a7 Respectfully check on elderly neighbors to make sure their air conditioning is working and in use.\n\nHow you can help\n\n\u00a7 Donations of snacks, sun protection aids like hats, sunscreen, sunglasses, light-weight clothing, and bottled water are needed. Visit the MAG Heat Relief Network Interactive Map to search for a donation collection site near you.\n\n\u00a7 Educate your friends and neighbors about the dangers of extreme heat.\n\n\u00a7 Have water bottles available in your car for emergencies.\n\nArizona Republic reporter Ian James contributed to this story.\n\nErin Stone covers the environment for The Arizona Republic and azcentral.com.

The bulk of it, though, is just sitting there, which is crazy when you think of how many small businesses are struggling just to get through the month.\n\nWolfe figures many one- or two-person operations probably don\u2019t know about the available help while other small business owners may worry that it could interfere with their Paycheck Protection Program loans. (Wolfe says it won\u2019t, as long as the money is spent on legitimate business expenses not already covered by PPP funds.)\n\nBusiness owners who have obtained the city grants tell me it\u2019s helped them through rough times they never could have imagined.\n\nPeople like Veronica Manriquez, who owns Clamatos La Cruda, a restaurant near 32nd Street and Thomas. Manriquez got a $10,000 check from the city just a few days ago.\n\n\u201cPaying the rent is going to be the first thing and I\u2019m a little bit behind with two of my loyal employees,\u201d she said.\n\nPeople like Mabel Tsosie, who owns Spottedhorse Infosystems LLC. Tsosie works out of her own home, offering computer, business support and consulting services. Her $3,000 micro business grant allowed her to buy new equipment to boost her computing power as she looks for ways to replace lost business.\n\n\u201cEverything is so uncertain right now,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s scary and being the smallest of the small business, you\u2019re just that much more scared. It (the grant) helped me feel more empowered by just having more powerful tools. You feel like you\u2019re ready to figure out what\u2019s out there with the next pivot.\u201d\n\nPeople like Chris Windsor, whose company, LRW Cutting Tools, manufactures tools used in the aerospace industry. Windsor and his father, Richard, got a PPP loan to cover payroll for their 15 employees but had nothing left over to pay suppliers when business vanished in March. The city\u2019s $10,000 grant bridged the gap until business started slowly returning.\n\n\u201cIt was certainly helpful in making sure we were meeting our obligations,\u201d he said.\n\nPeople like Joe Seriale, who owns Joe\u2019s Diner in the city\u2019s Melrose District.\n\nHe saw an 88% drop in sales as a result of COVID-19. His PPP loan covered payroll for 13 employees but that money\u2019s gone now. The $10,000 city grant allowed him to continue paying his employees along with rent and utilities.\n\n\u201cDamn right, it helped,\" he said. \"It gave me at least a month of breath and if I can stretch it out, a month and a half. You\u2019re damn straight it helped. It was lifesaving. All I\u2019m doing now is rebuilding my business like I did when I started.\u201d\n\nRebuilding. There\u2019s a lot of that going on now by people who are the backbone of Phoenix.\n\nThey don\u2019t get the sweetheart deals. They don\u2019t hire lobbyists or have family or banking connections to make sure they\u2019re first in line to scoop the goodies being doled out in Washington D.C.\n\nThey\u2019re just hard working people trying to hang on.\n\nIf you\u2019re one of them, I figure you should know that the city is offering at least some glue to try to hold things together.\n\nDoes your business qualify?\n\nIf you own employ up to 24 people in Phoenix, were in business on Jan 1. 2019 and saw a 25% drop in year-over-year sales in either March or April 2020, here\u2019s what the city can do for you:\n\n-Small Business Relief Grant. These grants, ranging from $3,000 to $10,000, are available to companies that employ six to 24 people, had gross sales of up to $3 million in 2019 and are located in or near a low-income neighborhood as defined by 2010 Census. (Downtown Phoenix counts, as do portions of Midtown and even the edges of Arcadia. To see if your business qualifies, check out the map at the Arizona Community Foundation, which is screening applications for the city\u2019s grant program.)\n\nOf the $5 million the city has allocated for small business relief, $4 million is still available. That\u2019s enough to help anywhere from 400 to 1,300 businesses.\n\n-Micro Business Resiliency Grant. These grants of $3,000 and $5,000 are available to those who work for themselves or employ up to five people in a business with gross sales of up to $1 million. This includes everything from home-based businesses to Uber and DoorDash drivers to food truck operators.\n\nMore than $6 million of the $8.25 million allocated to this program is just sitting there, waiting for people to claim it. That\u2019s enough to help at least 2,000 businesses.\n\n- Commercial City Services Bill Relief. The city has set aside $5 million to help cover water and sewer bills for commercial operations.

The City of Phoenix will contribute $150 million toward the renovation, and the Suns will contribute $80 million.\n\nThe measure was approved by a 6-2 margin just before 6 p.m. Wednesday after over three hours of discussion by city council members, residents and business leaders who favored and opposed the renovations. Vice Mayor Jim Waring and Councilman Sal DiCiccio voted against the measure.\n\nThe city will fund its portion of the renovations through its Sports Facilities Fund, generated by existing tourism-related excise taxes -- specifically, a 1 percent hotel tax and a 2 percent rental car tax. Any spending beyond $230 million will be funded by the Suns.\n\nRenovations will include repair and replacement of mechanical, electrical and plumbing infrastructure for the arena, which the Suns have called home since the 1992-93 NBA season.\n\nPer the agreement, the Suns will build an off-site practice facility in Phoenix, at an estimated cost of $25-$50 million, in order to free up space at Talking Stick Resort Arena. The Suns will be required to pay for that facility.\n\nThe city council added an amendment introduced by Councilwoman Vania Guevara on Wednesday in which the Suns will commit at least $10 million toward community endeavors, including $2.6 toward the city's Head Start preschool program. Suns owner Robert Sarver, who attended Wednesday's meeting, expressed his support for the amendment.\n\nThe Phoenix City Council was originally scheduled to vote on the renovation project Dec. 12, but the vote was pushed back amid growing concern about the cost and sources of funding for those renovations. The city held a series of open forums in the last month to allow citizens to discuss the project before it was put to a vote.\n\nPreviously, the Suns' arena contract with the city ran through 2032, but the team could have opted out as soon as 2022 if certain criteria were met. With Wednesday's vote, that contract has been extended until 2037, with an option to extend it to 2042.\n\nThe city anticipates collecting additional fees and rent from the Suns as a result of the proposed renovation -- an estimated $60 million over the term of the agreement. The Suns and the city will both make annual contributions to a Renewal and Replacement Account to ensure the arena's infrastructure remains intact throughout the lifetime of the contract. Phoenix will contribute $2 million annually (up to $25 million total) from its Sports Facilities Fund, and the Suns will contribute $1 million annually (up to $12.5 million total).\n\nThe Phoenix Arena Development Limited Partnership will continue to pay all operations, event and maintenance expenses for the arena. The Suns agree to pay up to $200 million to the city if they relocate out of Phoenix before the end of the amended contract in 2037.\n\nSarver has been adamant that Talking Stick Resort Arena is in dire need of renovations -- but in December, he assured fans that the Suns will not leave Phoenix, despite a report that he could seek to relocate the team if the renovation measure was rejected.\n\nHere's a breakdown of estimated renovation costs: (Go here for more details)\n\n$99.58 million: Maintenance for mechanical, electrical, plumbing and communication systems. This includes brand-new pipe, fittings, insulation, valves and instrumentation, upgraded digital control systems, a new LED lighting system, a replacement of outdated communication systems, new plumbing fixtures, new sewer lines and new rainwater drain systems. The city says it would fund the majority of these expenses.\n\n$26.37 million: Replacements for worn-out and non-working furniture, fixtures and equipment throughout the arena, along with new arena artwork, and repairs to food service areas and food service equipment for over 30 arena concession stands.\n\n$18.65 million: Technology and security upgrades, including CCTV security system upgrades and a new multi-function video board, ribbon board and digital control room.\n\n$17.63 million: Enhancements to the exterior wall and building envelope that will, in the city's words, \"improve building efficiency and enhance the architecture and streetscape appeal of the facility.\"\n\n$14.81 million: Improvements to lower- and upper-level seating areas, including resurfacing and recoating of stairs and platforms, replacement of damaged seats, new hallways and entrances to seating sections, and a widening of the concourse in the corners of the arena in order to provide views of the event floor.\n\n$13.17 million: Improvements to locker rooms, VIP and premium spaces, and repurposing of the current practice courts in order to free up space for storage and circulation.\n\n$11.67 million: New and repaired elevators and escalators throughout the arena.\n\n$9.8 million: Main concourse improvements, including an expansion of the concourse to create more space, more concession stands, and improved circulation in order to make loading and unloading easier.\n\n$7.21 million: Improvements to Lower Suite Level A, which includes club upgrades, improved circulation and back-of-house spaces. The Suns would pay for these improvements.\n\n$5.01 million: Roof and structural upgrades.\n\n$4.88 million: Improvements to the upper concourse, including widening of the concourse in order to improve circulation, which will improve access to seating, concession stands and restrooms. Also, new concession stands and storage improvements in the upper concourse.\n\n$4.21 million: Improvements to Upper Suite Level B, including access, storage and circulation enhancements.

Phoenix has more than $4 billion in unfunded pension debt. That means the city doesn't have the assets to cover the full cost of benefits it owes to its retirees.\n\nThe City of Phoenix Employees\u2019 Retirement System (COPERS) manages retirement benefits for city employees. The city's police and fire departments receive retirement benefits through a state-run system called the Public Safety Personnel Retirement System (PSPRS).\n\nCOPERS' pensions make up 36% of Phoenix's unfunded pension debt, while police and fire make up about 64%.\n\nLast year, Phoenix spent $376 million on city employees' pension benefits. This year, the city plans to spend $426 million.\n\nPassage of Prop. 106 would require the city to put any excess funding toward pension debt, end pensions for city council members, create annual pension debt assessments and prevent new city spending if pensions are not 90% funded.\n\nAs part of the campaign for Prop. 106, Responsible Budgets has circulated figures about what the pension debt means for Phoenix taxpayers.\n\nOn their website, the group claims, \u201cEvery Phoenix family owes $13,290 in unfunded pensions.\u201d It's not clear how the group arrived at that figure.\n\nAccording to the City of Phoenix's Comprehensive Annual Financial Report published in June 2018, the city's net pension liability is $4.56 billion.\n\nAnd according to Census data from July 2018, Phoenix has 544,022 households. Dividing those two numbers puts the city\u2019s pension debt at about $8,730 per family.\n\nA spokeswoman for Responsible Budgets, Merissa Hamilton, told AZ Fact Check in an email that the $13,290 figure comes from \u201cthe $5.7B unfunded pension liability divided by the number of households in Phoenix.\u201d\n\nThe group did not provide a source for the $5.7 billion figure. But even when using this number, the cost per family comes to about $10,730, almost $3,000 less than the amount Responsible Budgets cited.\n\nHamilton said because there were fewer households in Phoenix at the time Responsible Budgets began their campaign, the math in the past did work out to around $13,000. She did not clarify when the group began working on the Prop 106 initiative.\n\nAs the money for pension funds comes through tax collection, it\u2019s important to note that every family in the city of Phoenix is not obligated to pay a certain amount of pension debt. Rather, taxpayers foot the bill through taxes they already pay to the city, mainly in the form of sales tax.\n\nAlso, dividing the city's pension debt by the number of households in Phoenix makes the price tag Responsible Budgets provides significantly greater. If the debt was divided by the actual population, the individual burden would be a fourth of what the group claims, or about $3,000.\n\nPhoenix spokesman Matthew Heil likens the city\u2019s current pension payment plan to paying off a mortgage on a house.\n\n\u201cJust like a mortgage, the cost is not paid in full up front but is spread over many years to be manageable. State law allows the city to do this, and we have always paid 100% of the required contribution,\u201d Heil said.\n\nThat doesn't mean the debt isn't creating escalating consequences, though. A state law enacted in 2018 requires the city to publish their plan for funding the pension deficit every year.\n\nIn a city council report from March outlining Phoenix's pension funding objectives, the city acknowledges, \u201cIncreases in net pension liabilities and annual pension costs have placed significant budgetary constraints on the City's ability to provide employee wage and non-pension benefit increases.... While currently manageable, this pressure will continue into the foreseeable future.\u201d\n\nHeil notes the city already has taken steps to help pay off the money it owes to its retirees.\n\n\u201cThe city has, through referendum and administrative action, already implemented pension reforms, which have improved the city\u2019s ability to meet its obligations and will continue to look for further reforms,\u201d Heil said.\n\nStill, Phoenix's pension debt is growing, and so are concerns about funding it long-term.\n\nBOTTOM LINE: Regardless of what portion of Phoenix\u2019s pension debt each family accounts for when the debt pool is divided among them, every family is not liable for a certain amount of the total. Rather, taxpayer dollars fund the city\u2019s pension liability. Also, the numbers Responsible Budgets uses to justify their claim are inaccurate.\n\nSOURCES: \"Responsible Budgets,\" website, www.responsiblebudgets.com, accessed July 30, 2019; \"Phoenix voters could fundamentally change the city in August.

The hydrogels can absorb up to 400 percent of their weight in water and release up to 96 percent of the water into the turf, retaining the ability to absorb and release water over a period of 5 to 7 years, according to the City of Phoenix.\n\n\u201cWe are eager to see if this project produces similar or better conservation results in our climate and soil as compared to California,\u201d said JoEllen Alberhasky, program manager for sustainability practices at ASU. \u201cIf so, it will become another valuable tool in addressing the ongoing drought in Arizona.\u201d\n\nIf the program is successful, Sorensen said the City of Phoenix will likely expand the use of hydrogels to more of its turf facilities, including city parks and municipal golf courses. The city would also try to make the technology available to private golf courses, sports facilities and, eventually, even homeowners.\n\n\u201cWhether we would just encourage other, private individuals to use it or offer an incentive is, at this point, unknown,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s just too early to know yet.\u201d\n\nBut one thing is certain: If hydrogels lead to healthy, green grass while using less water, they are a win for Arizona.\n\n\u201cWe know that the flows of the Colorado River are going to diminish over time and that the river is already over-allocated,\u201d Sorensen said.\n\nLooking to the future, she said, Arizonans need to continue to innovate and create new ways to save water.\n\n\u201c[We must] use our water wisely so that we can continue to provide the quality of life that we have here in the Valley of the Sun,\u201d she said.", "title": "City of Phoenix to pilot new water conservation technology at ASU West campus", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Phoenix']"}, {"id": 88, "city": "Phoenix", "url": "https://www.multihousingnews.com/post/city-of-phoenix-breaks-ground-on-affordable-housing-project/", "text": "The old A.L.

Krohn East public housing community, built about 60 years ago.\n\nRents in Arizona\u2019s capital have been soaring, putting more pressure on low-income residents. According to Yardi Matrix data, rent gains were up 6.1 percent year-over-year through September, placing Phoenix on the second spot among the country\u2019s major metros for rent growth.\n\nLocated at 1441 E. Monroe St., the new Monroe Gardens Apartments will turn 38 units of obsolete public housing into energy-efficient apartments. The new community is set to consist of five buildings with one- to five-bedroom units. Amenities are slated to include a new playground and community space. The project is being built through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s Rental Assistance Demonstration program that allows residents to spend 30 percent of their income on rent.\n\nAccording to Fox 10 Phoenix, the redevelopment of the site is being funded through a portion of a $30 million U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development grant for the modernization of the entire Edison-Eastlake neighborhood. Furthermore, Arizona\u2019s Department of Housing is providing federal tax credits.

Scooter vendors would be required to collect the scooters at night to charge and return to docking locations in the morning.\n\nDevney Preuss , executive director for the Phoenix Community Alliance, which has worked with the city to develop the proposed program, said the boundaries represent the redevelopment area in downtown Phoenix.\n\n\"It is the commercial, urban center of Phoenix,\" Preuss said. \"Anything beyond the boundaries starts to become residential, so we hope to have a relationship with the communities there to have an open dialogue about why the scooters are not in their neighborhoods and why they shouldn't be.\"\n\nRiders in the pilot program will need to be at least 18 years old and have a valid driver's license. The scooters will be prohibited on sidewalks and must be ridden on the street or in bike lanes at a maximum speed of 15 MPH.\n\nStaff has proposed various kinds of fees to cover the cost of the program, including a $500 vendor application fee and $80 relocation fee, which would apply if city staff has to move a scooter back into the designated area.\n\nStipulations would include:\n\nEach vendor could have a maximum of 300 scooters.\n\nEach vendor could have four scooters per staging location.\n\nA 100-foot distance between staging locations.\n\nScooters must adhere to the latest safety and durability standards and include front and back lights.\n\nVendors must submit to the city details on how it will teach customers how to safely ride and park a scooter.\n\nVendors must encourage the use of helmets and encourage riders to use lower-traffic streets.\n\nThroughout the pilot program, officials will evaluate and collect data on ridership trends, incidents, community feedback and rider surveys and compliance.\n\nKini Knudson, director of City of Phoenix Street Transportation Department, said his department has been closely monitoring other cities that have already implemented similar programs.\n\n\u201cWe know there have been some success stories and some that were not so successful,\" Knudson said. \"We wanted to have an opportunity to draw some boundaries around our program and see how it would work in an area like downtown where you have a definite demand.\u201d\n\nMoving forward despite safety concerns\n\nAfter the presentation, Councilwoman Felicita Mendoza asked Velez and Knudson to address safety concerns including policies in the instance of inebriated scooter drivers and who would be at fault in the case of an accident.\n\nVelez said the ordinance changes necessary to implement the program would allow the police department to issue civil traffic violations and apply traffic laws to scooter riders.\n\nScooter rider deaths have been documented in cities across the nation and Tempe Assistant Fire Chief Andrea Glass has told The Arizona Republic the Tempe Fire Department responded to 119 scooter-related incidents that resulted in injuries between June and December.\n\nEven without the scooters, Arizona cities have significant numbers of pedestrian deaths. Data from the Governors Highway Safety Association released in 2017 indicated Arizona has the highest number of pedestrian deaths per population in the nation. Data released in 2018 showed pedestrian deaths in Arizona rose five percent from 2017 to 2018.\n\n\u201cSafety has been a big issue and I know \u2026 it will be something we focus in on as we monitor and evaluate the metrics of the program,\" Councilwoman Debra Stark said.\n\nMendoza recommended the city revisit the program after 90 days for evaluation. With this amendment, staff recommended the pilot program for approval.\n\nPreparing to kick off\n\nTo begin the pilot program, the City Council will need to approve the associated fees and amend the ordinance currently keeping electric scooters out of downtown.\n\nThe council is scheduled to hear the proposal at the March 20 meeting.\n\nKnudson said ordinances typically have a 30-day wait period before they go into effect, so staff will revisit the program 90 days after the first permit is issued.\n\nPreuss said the increasing connectivity of people who live, work and play in downtown Phoenix heightens the need for increasing modes of alternative transportation.\n\n\"People no longer want to move in and out of the city quickly after they get off work,\" she said. \"We now have amenities that people want to experience, which the scooters can increase their access to.\"\n\nDowntown Phoenix is the optimal location for this program because it is the walkable, urban epicenter of the city, Preuss said.\n\n\"These scooter companies wanted to be in Phoenix yesterday, but they understand the need to address all of the concerns and work with the city so they can be as successful as possible when they enter the market,\" she said.\n\nArizona State University officials did not immediately respond to questions about whether it would ban the scooters on its downtown campus.

If there are laws that help drivers stay in line, that lowers the risk of a person being badly injured or even worse.\u201d\n\nPhoenix City Council approved $2 million for pedestrian safety in June. The newest spending proposal from the Street Transportation Department and the Office of Pedestrian Safety allocates that money for specific areas of improvement.\n\n\u201cObviously the city is growing very rapidly and we want to ensure that the kinds of signals and infrastructure and education that we do as a city is focused on pedestrian safety,\u201d said Heather Murphy, the Communications and Public Engagement representative for the Street Transportation Department.\n\nThe decision to approve the proposal comes after mounting pressure from Phoenix residents.\n\nAccording to a report from the Arizona Department of Transportation, last year there were 245 pedestrians killed throughout Arizona\u2019s 15 counties, with 166 of these in Maricopa County.\n\nAn investigation published by the Arizona Republic in April also revealed abnormally high rates of pedestrian deaths and a history of inaction from the city of Phoenix. According to the article, the city of Phoenix failed to install crosswalks in locations with high fatality rates within the past five years.\n\nWeeks after the Arizona Republic published its findings, the Phoenix City Council rejected a proposed pedestrian safety plan. Vision Zero, a national non-profit pedestrian safety project, failed with a 4-4 vote.\n\nThe newest proposal focuses the majority of funding on building crosswalks, medians and streetlights.\n\nThis includes $600,000 for high intensity activated crosswalks (HAWK) and another $660,000 for crosswalk upgrades, including pedestrian warning signs and installation of access ramps.\n\nThe proposal also includes the new partnership between the Street Transportation Department and the Design Studio for Community Solutions.\n\nThe partnership hopes to analyze the different factors that lead to pedestrian deaths and make changes accordingly through a proposed $50,000 research grant. This includes identifying areas where pedestrian deaths are most common.\n\nThe Design Studio for Community Solutions previously worked on pedestrian safety issues in Maryvale where according to director Erik Cole, there are a number of high-risk areas.\n\n\u201cThe city has identified some hotspots where there are repetitive deaths of pedestrians,\u201d Cole said. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard from the community that this is a critical issue that needs to be addressed. This is an area where walking is not really a choice, it\u2019s a necessity.\u201d\n\nReach the reporter at kiera10riley@gmail.com or follow @kiera_riley on Twitter.\n\nLike The State Press on Facebook and follow @statepress on Twitter.\n\nRelated Stories", "title": "The city of Phoenix makes changes to ensure pedestrian safety", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Phoenix']"}, {"id": 91, "city": "Phoenix", "url": "https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/city-of-phoenix-partners-with-cigna-to-offer-water-aerobics-for-seniors", "text": "PHOENIX (FOX 10) -- The City of Phoenix has a great program that helps senior citizens stay active and all they have to do is head to the local public pool.\n\nMaking a splash can be good for your health, that's why the City of Phoenix teamed up with Cigna Healthcare.\n\nExperts say exercise keeps you healthy.

It will take effect July 1, and business owners who don't comply will face fines of up to $2,000.\n\nCashless policies are gaining currency in a number of cities, with some business owners saying that handling cash is inefficient and invites theft. But opponents say cashless establishments exclude people who are \"unbanked,\" or those lacking checking or savings accounts. In 2017, 8.4 million U.S. households were unbanked, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\n\nGet Breaking News Delivered to Your Inbox\n\nPhiladelphia city councilman Bill Greenlee, a co-sponsor of the bill, said the new law restores the right of everyone with money to do business in stores.\n\n\"I can go into a coffee shop across from City Hall that's cashless and get my coffee and muffin, but the person behind me that has United States currency can't get the same cup of coffee.

While McHugh is not expected to grant a final ruling today, the case will likely determine the future of supervised injection sites in the city, as well as serve as a litmus test for cities across the country also grappling with the opioid crisis.\n\nPowerful exhibit outside the courthouse ahead of the hearing about supervised injection sites: a monument in memory for the 1,116 Philadelphians that died a completely preventable overdose death in 2018. pic.twitter.com/wlzQfcVOGt \u2014 Av @ US v. Safehouse court hearing (@abgutman) September 5, 2019\n\nSupervised injection sites are regulated establishments where drug users can inject heroin on premises. Although they do not provide drugs, they do provide free clean hypodermic needles and alcohol swabs to users to reduce the risk of infection, as well as addiction support and counseling services. Medically trained staff members at the site would also carry the drug naloxone, also known as Narcan, a treatment that reverses the effects of opioid overdose, which could potentially save countless lives. According to an article published in a Canadian medical journal, safe injection sites have been associated with lower mortality rates, as well as a decrease in OD-related ambulance calls and rates of HIV infection. Critics, however, have said there isn\u2019t enough substantive research to determine whether these sites are actually beneficial for drug users.\n\nAlthough such supervised injections have long been operating in major Canadian cities like Toronto and Vancouver, they have yet to make their way to the United States. While a number of major American cities, such as Denver and New York, have announced plans to open safe injection sites, none of these have come to fruition, largely due to opposition from lawmakers, who have argued that supervised injection sites violate what\u2019s known as the \u201ccrack house statute.\u201d A provision of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), the statute makes it illegal for anyone to \u201cknowingly open, lease, rent, use, or maintain any place for the purpose of manufacturing, distributing, or using any controlled substance.\u201d In 2018, deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein penned an op-ed for the New York Times reiterating this argument, writing that \u201ccities and counties should expect the Department of Justice to meet the opening of any injection site with swift and aggressive action.\u201d\n\nPhiladelphia Mayor Jim Kenney has expressed his approval for plans to build the site, even visiting Canada in July to tour legal injection facilities there. Yet many local lawmakers have expressed their opposition to the idea, most notably McSwain, a Trump appointee who filed a civil suit back in February attempting to prevent the Safehouse site from opening, on the grounds that it constituted a violation of the crack house statute. \u201cThis is in-your-face illegal activity using some of the most deadly, dangerous drugs that are on the streets. We have a responsibility to step in,\u201d he told NPR at the time.\n\nIn response to the suit, Rhonda Goldfein, a board member of Safehouse, said that the crack house statute should not apply to supervised injection sites, which do not provide drugs and instead focus on harm reduction and overdose prevention. \u201cWe have a disagreement on the analysis and intention of the law,\u201d Goldfein told NPR at the time. \u201cWe don\u2019t think it was intended to prevent activities such as this, and perhaps it will take a court\u2019s ruling to move the issue forward.\u201d Lawyers for Safehouse have also argued that blocking the site from opening violates its religious freedoms, specifically Judeo-Christian tenets about the value of \u201cpreserving life.\u201d\n\nPhiladelphia has the highest overdose rate of any major U.S. city, with nearly three people a day fatally overdosing on opioids in 2018. Kensington in particular, where the injection site would be built, is known as a hotbed for drug use, with the New York Times referring to it last year as \u201cthe largest open-air narcotics market for heroin on the East Coast.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, Mayor Kenney assembled a task force to figure out how to solve the problem of opioid overdoses in the city. The task force recommended opening up a supervised injection site, leading Kenney to formally announce plans to open up such an establishment in early 2018. A Drexel University survey from early this year found that the vast majority of Kensington residents support plans for the site, with 90% of the 360 neighborhood residents they surveyed voicing their approval.\n\nAccording to data from the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA), nearly 130 people die of opioid overdoses every day, with 47,000 Americans dying in 2017 alone.", "title": "Philadelphia May Become the First City to Open Safe Injection Sites", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "['drug']", "annot_city": "['Philadelphia']"}, {"id": 95, "city": "Philadelphia", "url": "https://technical.ly/philly/2019/10/17/city-of-philadelphia-strategic-plan-office-innovation-technology/", "text": "The City of Philadelphia\u2019s Office of Innovation and Technology (OIT) released a public-facing plan and set of strategies to drive innovation and change within city government on Wednesday.\n\nThe report, officially called the \u201cIT Strategic Plan: An Inclusive Approach to Crafting Vision and Strategy for Technology Across City Government,\u201d addresses how OIT and other City departments can solves challenges in response to public needs.\n\nThe process began in early spring 2018 when those in OIT began talking internally and with other departments about what the City was doing well and what it could be doing better in terms of technology, said Chief Information Officer Mark Wheeler.\n\nThe office opened those questions up to a focus group of about 30 City stakeholders, community leaders and technologists, said Andrew Buss, deputy chief information officer for innovation management.

London, Stockholm and Singapore have had such traffic schemes in place for over a decade, the latter first applying the fees as far back as 1975.\n\nAll three cities have seen success in both traffic and carbon dioxide reduction, according to the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, a nonprofit that studies and advocates for public transit in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut.\n\nHowever, despite London's past success, the city has struggled in recent years due to exceptions like those granted to \"private hire vehicles\" used by rideshare drivers. \"Congestion levels have now risen to levels not seen since the Congestion Charging scheme was introduced in 2003 although without the scheme, congestion would be far worse than it is now,\" according to a December 2018 report by the city.\n\nMoreover, though other places around the world have tried it, congestion pricing is still new in the U.S. New York is poised to become the first city in the country to apply such fees when it charges drivers in Manhattan.\n\nPhiladelphia will consequently be looking at New York's results to shape its own congestion pricing scheme.\n\n\"We always pay attention to policies in other cities to see if they can be adapted to fit Philadelphia's unique circumstances, and we'll be watching NYC's experience with congestion pricing closely to see how this can help improve equity, safety, sustainability, and mobility,\" Cofrancisco said.\n\nBut a big hurdle for both cities is the fact that the latter has not yet determined how much it will charge, and its fee will likely not be in effect until at least 2021. In the interim, Philadelphia is considering other options.\n\nAlready the city cut down on transit times on Market and Chestnut streets in Center City by having both Philadelphia and SEPTA police, as well as the Philadelphia Parking Authority, crack down on things like double parking and cars driving on the bus lane, according to a city report of the initiative.\n\nResidents will also be able to vote on another proposal next month. If approved, the resolution proposed by City Council President Darrell L. Clarke would amend the city's charter to create new Public Safety Enforcement officers who would focus on quality of life issues like traffic while allowing police officers to focus on more serious crimes.\n\nThat proposal will be on the ballot at the next elections on May 21st.", "title": "Is Philadelphia Introducing Congestion Fees for Drivers?

The first set of workshops focused on procuring renewable energy through off-site power purchase agreements (PPAs).\n\nThe initiative grew out of a PPA the city signed about a year ago with Community Solar for the output from a 70 MW solar plant in Adams County, Pennsylvania. The PPA will provide enough electricity to power 22% of Philadelphia\u2019s government buildings, which will move the city closer to its goal of powering the city with 100% renewable energy by 2030.\n\n\u201cFolks were reaching out to us, so we decided to take a different type of leadership role\u201d with groups that operate and construct buildings, said Adam Agalloco, energy manager in Philadelphia\u2019s Office of Sustainability. His office is in the process of figuring out what other topics the collaborative should present in the future to work on.\n\nVision for Philadelphia\n\nThe city\u2019s renewable energy goal sits within the larger framework of goals Kenney set for the city, particularly after President Donald Trump\u2019s June 2017 announcement that he would withdraw the US from the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change mitigation.\n\nLater the same month, Kenney signed the Sierra Club\u2019s Ready for 100 pledge, committing to a 100% clean energy goal as part of Philadelphia\u2019s long-term commitment to reduce citywide carbon emissions 80% by 2050. To date, 141 cities have signed the Sierra Club\u2019s pledge.\n\nIn \u201cPower Our Future: A Clean Energy Vision for Philadelphia,\u201d the city lays out its strategy for achieving its goals. The plan includes installing solar generation on rooftops and other surfaces throughout the city, eliminating energy waste in homes and businesses in the city, working toward clean energy supplies from the wider grid, and taking a low carbon emissions approach to thermal energy in the city.\n\nTo reduce thermal energy needs, the city envisions wider electrification of heating and cooling from power derived from clean energy sources, as well as more efficient equipment such as heat pumps. The city is also looking at expanding the use of district heating systems, which provide both electric power and thermal energy from a single plant.\n\nDistrict energy and microgrid projects\n\nPhiladelphia already has several district energy systems. Veolia Energy, for instance, operates a natural gas-fired district system that provides steam to the University of Pennsylvania, Drexel University, the Comcast Center and the Philadelphia Museum of Art.\n\nPhiladelphia is also exploring the potential of incorporating microgrid projects, particularly those that pair solar power with battery storage, at large new developments. It is already home to one of the nation\u2019s most sophisticated microgrids, located at the Navy Yard.\n\nFree Resource from Microgrid Knowledge Library Agriculture on the Grid Edge: How the California Public Safety Power Shutoffs Broke the Camel\u2019s Back Technology innovations are changing the game, while public policies and regulations are shifting to allow new business models to gain traction.

But the city has little control over the sources that provide energy for PJM\u2019s grid. While PJM\u2019s grid is getting cleaner, fossil fuels still provide about 63% of PJM\u2019s electrical output.\n\nAs Powering Our Future makes clear, clean power from the grid is essential for Philadelphia to meet its goals. \u201cWe can\u2019t reach our goals without the grid,\u201d Agalloco said.\n\nEnlisting partners to create demand for clean energy\n\nTo that end, the city is enlisting businesses and residents to embrace clean energy as a way of creating more demand for clean energy and to lobby for cleaner energy with campaigns aimed at state legislators. \u201cThe state legislature has bigger levers to pull,\u201d Agalloco said.\n\nTo some extent, that is already starting to happen. In early October, Gov. Tom Wolf (D) directed the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a market-based collaboration of nine Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change.\n\nMaking cities members of PJM\n\nPhiladelphia is also working with a handful of other cities to figure out a strategy to advocate and become members of PJM as a group, Agalloco said. \u201cWe have talked with every major city in PJM.\u201d\n\nPJM members have the right to attend PJM strategy and regulations meetings and vote as stakeholders, which could potentially give those cities, as a group, a greater voice is moving the wholesale regional market closer toward the goals Philadelphia and over 100 other cites cities have set for themselves.\n\nJoin Microgrid Knowledge June 2-3 in Philadelpia for Microgrid 2020.", "title": "Philadelphia Tackles Climate Change through Partnerships", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Philadelphia']"}, {"id": 100, "city": "Philadelphia", "url": "https://whyy.org/articles/philly-pilots-program-to-pay-for-some-detained-immigrants-legal-defense/", "text": "In immigration court, the government always has a lawyer \u2014 but far fewer than half of all defendants do.\n\nNow, the city of Philadelphia, along with the Vera Institute of Justice, has launched a one-year pilot program offering pro bono legal support on a first-come, first-served basis to low-income immigrants facing deportation.\n\n\u201cPhiladelphia has emerged as a fearless leader in local response to shifting immigration policy and federal immigration enforcement,\u201d Mayor Jim Kenney said Tuesday during the announcement at the National Constitution Center. \u201cThis new deportation defense fits in with other pro-immigrant policies we embrace and continue to advance.\u201d\n\nVera and the city have ponied up $100,000 apiece to support two pro bono attorneys: one with the Pennsylvania Immigration Resource Center in York, Pa., and one with Nationalities Service Center in Philadelphia.

Andrew Cuomo said in a statement that although no injuries were reported, \"the fact that it happened at all is unacceptable.\" He said the state Department of Public Service will investigate.Most Broadway musicals and plays canceled their Saturday evening shows, including \"Hadestown,\" which last month won the Tony Award for best musical. Several cast members from the musical \"Come From Away\" held an impromptu performance in the street outside the theater for disappointed audience members.Emily Totero, 30, planned to bring out-of-town guests to see \"Moulin Rouge.\" But once they got to the theater district, they saw the power go out.\"You could see all the theater lights across the street, all the marquees went out. That's what we noticed first,\" she said.The outage also hit Madison Square Garden, where Jennifer Lopez was performing Saturday night. Attendees said the concert went dark about 9:30 p.m. in the middle of Lopez's fourth song of the night. The arena was later evacuated.And at Penn Station, officials were using backup generators to keep the lights on.When the lights went out early Saturday evening, thousands of people streamed out of darkened Manhattan buildings, crowding Broadway next to bumper-to-bumper traffic.People in the neighborhood commonly known as Hell's Kitchen began directing traffic themselves as stoplights and walking signs went dark.Ginger Tidwell, a dance teacher and Upper West Side resident, was about to order at a West Side diner on Broadway and West 69th Street just before 7 p.m.\"When the lights started flickering, and then were out, we got up and left, walking up Broadway with all the traffic lights out and businesses dark,\" she said.But once they got to West 72nd Street, they found another diner that was open and had power.\"It was still sunny and everyone just came out to the street because they lost power and air conditioning; it was super-crowded,\" she said. \"Everyone was hanging out on the street on a nice night.

For many, the tranquility of the outdoors has provided an escape from the stress of the current times.\n\nThe Rivard Report has kept up with this trend by covering urban fishing, the extension of the Mission Reach trail system, the desire to kayak in downtown, and people using the outdoors to escape being cooped-up at home. COVID-19 has reminded us that our creeks, rivers, parks, and green spaces are woven into our life as places that we need for personal physical and mental well-being as well as our community\u2019s economic strength, which is why it\u2019s important to preserve the health of these spaces.\n\nI\u2019m happy to see that the San Antonio River Authority (River Authority) parks and trails have experienced a significant increase in use over the last several months. Trail counters along the Mission Reach registered nearly 124,000 hits this April and May. That equates to over 7,000 more users on the trails each week this year as compared to this same time in 2019, which is an 83 percent increase. Paddling along the river is also growing as people (practicing social distancing) are taking to kayaking to get fresh air and disconnect from virtual learning and remote work in order to relax along the river.\n\nIn addition to more people enjoying the Mission Reach, River Authority, local wildlife is thriving. We recently concluded an avian study that counted over 65,000 birds using the restored habitat. Resident birds and migratory birds were counted totaling more than 200 different bird species. A few years ago, we collaborated with the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department to reintroduce the native Guadalupe bass, and our scientists have identified the fifth generation of this bass species now populating the Mission Reach. River Authority scientists are also planning to reintroduce native mussels. We are demonstrating it is possible to increase the quality, quantity, and diversity of native species in and along an urban river while maintaining critical flood conveyance, improving quality of life for area residents, and stimulating economic benefits for the community.\n\nAside from the apparent benefits of the Museum Reach and downtown River Walk, the ecosystem restoration along the Mission Reach also provides economic benefits. The recreational amenities available in this restored habitat are also being used as a quality of life selling point to convince people to move to San Antonio. The health of the San Antonio River, and the networks of creeks and rivers throughout the basin, is vital to our community\u2019s collective quality of life and economy as well as our long-term resiliency and sustainability.\n\nWhile more people are enjoying a relaxing time along the river and wildlife is thriving, a couple of recent Rivard Report stories show how quickly human actions can threaten the environment. An ammonia spill earlier this month killed more than 5,000 fish. River Authority staff will oversee restoration efforts and are staying engaged with regulatory agencies to pursue an appropriate response to this fish kill event. Fortunately, the response was quick and no long-lasting harm is anticipated from the spill.\n\nThe River Authority is also responding to invasive apple snails. This invasive species has been introduced into our basin by people who have illegally dumped their fish tanks into the river. These snails have few native predators and are voracious herbivores. If they were to establish in the Mission Reach, they would pose a threat. Therefore, our experts are trying to eliminate them where they have been spotted in the Museum Reach and downtown sections of the River Walk. Please remember, never dump your aquarium into the river or any other freshwater or saltwater body.\n\nRiver Warrior volunteers help the River Authority with ecosystem restoration activities like planting native grasses and trees, removing invasive species, pruning, mulching trees, picking up litter, and helping maintain native habitats along the Mission Reach and at other River Authority parks like Confluence Park and John William Helton-San Antonio River Nature Park. The River Authority also offers trainings and educational events to the River Warriors so they can gain knowledge about sustainable, green infrastructure strategies like building rain gardens and become river protection ambassadors.\n\nWe are fortunate to live in a community with a long history of voter support for natural resources and elected leaders who have approved forward-thinking investments. This has resulted in, among other important initiatives, the historic San Antonio River Walk, the Museum Reach and Mission Reach additions to the River Walk, San Pedro Creek Culture Park, the Howard Peak Greenway Trails, and numerous area urban and nature parks. These places define our community and connect us to each other and to nature.\n\nAs we look toward recovery after these challenging times, it is our collective responsibility to protect our natural resources, provide more opportunities for green spaces, and connect people to nature as our population grows. San Antonio will eventually emerge from the COVID-19 crisis. When we do, let\u2019s make sure that these spaces continue to serve our community.", "title": "San Antonio\u2019s Green Spaces Offer Peace During a Pandemic", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['San Antonio']"}, {"id": 103, "city": "San Antonio", "url": "https://www.expressnews.com/news/local/politics/article/Can-you-get-evicted-for-not-paying-rent-It-15450311.php", "text": "Can you get evicted for not paying rent? It depends where...\n\nNow that both local and federal eviction moratoriums have expired, tenants\u2019 chances of getting evicted for not paying rent rest solely in the hands of Bexar County judges.\n\nEarly in the pandemic, Bexar County Judge Nelson Wolff and the Texas Supreme Court suspended evictions unless tenants posed an immediate criminal or safety threat. At the same time, Congress barred properties with federally backed mortgages or those participating in federal housing programs from filing evictions, a protection that ended July 24.\n\nWith those directives expired, the judges who oversee eviction cases in Bexar County can make their own decisions about whether to hold eviction court. Of the five judges who oversee the county\u2019s four justice of the peace courts, only two are hearing regular eviction cases \u2014 which has meant that a tenant's possibility of losing their home depends on the court precinct in which they live in the city.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s an extreme example of unequal justice,\u201d said Genevieve H\u00e9bert Fajardo, a law professor at St. Mary\u2019s University who helps run a hotline for tenants facing eviction. \u201cSome tenants will lose their homes during a pandemic, and others won\u2019t, solely on the virtue of where they live.\u201d\n\nNow Playing:\n\nGiven the uneven enforcement, it\u2019s unclear how many eviction cases will pile up in San Antonio. Also unknown is the number of tenants who can\u2019t pay their rent. This spring, the city set aside $50 million for rental and mortgage assistance, one of the largest outlays in the country. As a result, thousands of renters have been assisted, and the city still has about $20 million left in the pot.\n\nIan Benavidez, the assistant director of the city\u2019s Neighborhood and Housing Services Department, said eviction filings are down about 40 percent compared to last year. From January 2019 through June 2019, nearly 9,800 evictions were filed in local courts. This year, about 6,000 were filed through the end of July.\n\nBenavidez said there could be several factors driving the decrease.\n\nOne of them: It\u2019s estimated that roughly half of San Antonio\u2019s rental units were covered under the CARES Act eviction moratorium. After it expired, the law requires landlords to give tenants an additional 30-day notice to vacate, instead of the typical three-day notice.\n\nNow Playing:\n\nOn ExpressNews.com: \u2018The closest thing medicine gets to war\u2019: 24 hours inside a San Antonio ambulance\n\nWhen those cases resume, there could be a wave of eviction filings at the end of August, Benavidez said. But he is hoping that the city\u2019s commitment to earmark millions of dollars to housing assistance will help mitigate that.\n\nThe city\u2019s emergency housing fund is the largest of its kind in Texas and one of the largest in the nation, Benavidez said. For each family approved for help, the city will pay up to three months of rent, or up to $3,500; three months of utilities, or up to $1,500; internet costs; and up to $300 in cash.\n\nBy July 30, the money went to about 9,000 families struggling to pay rent and 1,700 who needed assistance paying mortgages.\n\nAs part of that program, the city set up workstations in each justice of the peace court to provide assistance if landlords decided not to move forward with evictions. With two judges now holding cases remotely, those city employees sit in on videoconference hearings to notify tenants and landlords about the assistance programs.\n\nSo far, nearly 100 cases have been dismissed or delayed so tenants and landlords could work out arrangements, with an additional 100 cases in the process, Benavidez said.\n\n\u201cHopefully, we\u2019ll be able to continue this past the emergency crisis because we know that evictions are not just a pandemic issue,\u201d Benavidez said. \u201cThey definitely were an issue pre-pandemic and will continue after.\u201d\n\nHousing attorneys and policy experts argue that it\u2019s not safe for families to be subjected to eviction in the middle of a pandemic \u2014 a process that can include going to court, having a constable move out a family\u2019s belongings and finding a new place to live.\n\nThey are calling on elected officials to pressure judges to adopt a countywide policy on eviction case proceedings \u2014 a decision that can be made only by the judges themselves.\n\nRight now, each court has a different plan. On the North Side, which is overseen by Justice of the Peace Court No. 3, the court is still moving forward with eviction hearings three days per week, scheduling roughly five to 10 cases on each of those days. Most cases are heard through video-conference or phone, although exceptions are made for landlords or tenants who don\u2019t have access to the technology and want to appear in person.\n\nMore Information More Information Are you facing an eviction or need help paying rent?

He scheduled more than 60 eviction cases to be heard the last week of July.\n\nBut his peer, Judge Ciro Rodriguez, the other judge who serves in Precinct 1, is still not hearing cases, unless they pose an immediate safety or criminal threat. Neither are the judges of Precinct 2 and 4, which encompass part of the West Side, downtown and the East Side.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably incredibly confusing for tenants themselves who are facing eviction,\u201d said Sofia Lopez, a researcher for the Action Center on Race and the Economy, an advocacy group that focuses on racial and economic justice. \u201cIt\u2019s all the more ludicrous that within the same precinct \u2014 Precinct 1 having two places \u2014 you could potentially have a hearing, but someone could tell you that Precinct 1 wasn\u2019t having hearings at all.\u201d\n\nJudge Rogelio Lopez Jr., who oversees Precinct 4\u2019s justice of the peace court, said under the Texas Supreme Court guidelines, judges can extend any court proceedings that they think could jeopardize the safety of their staff or public through September 30.\n\nLopez said he is closely watching COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in Bexar County, which began to skyrocket in June. He won\u2019t resume court proceedings until it appears safe to do so.\n\n\u201cThere was obviously a (Texas) Supreme Court moratorium that ordered us to (pause eviction proceedings), but once that was lifted, the courts were given discretion as to whether or not they felt safe opening or not,\u2019 said Lopez. \u201cThe decision and responsibility falls squarely on the shoulders of each individual judge.\u201d\n\nAnother reason he\u2019s not moving forward: Families facing eviction for not paying rent may not be able to afford the internet or cellphone cost to attend a hearing by Zoom or telephone. Nearly 1 in 4 Bexar County households don\u2019t have a desktop or laptop computer, and nearly 17 percent don\u2019t have internet access, according to 2018 census estimates.\n\n\u201cMy court handles 40,000 to 50,000 cases a year, so to try to do proceedings without having people there is not realistically feasible,\u201d Lopez said, referencing all his cases, including evictions, traffic and small claims. \u201cI can't have 100 people on a Zoom call and try and run through a docket.\u201d\n\nAcross the nation, it\u2019s estimated that 28 million households were at risk of eviction as the pandemic and economic crisis began to unfold, according to a study released in May by Amherst, an investment research firm.\n\nLopez, the researcher for the Action Center on Race and the Economy, said that\u2019s nearly three times the number of homeowners who lost their homes in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.\n\n\u201cIt feels like we\u2019re watching a train wreck about to happen,\u201d said Lopez. \u201cIt\u2019s ongoing, but it\u2019s about to get so much worse, and our elected officials and policy makers are just completely absent.\u201d\n\nMarina Starleaf Riker is an investigative reporter for the San Antonio Express-News with extensive experience covering affordable housing, inequality and disaster recovery.

The increase was the second-largest among the nation\u2019s cities behind Phoenix, which saw its population increase by 25,288 new residents. Fort Worth was third, with 19,552 new residents.\n\nAlthough this year\u2019s growth was significant, the last census survey put San Antonio at the No. 1 spot among the fastest-growing cities, said State Demographer Lloyd Potter, who serves as interim dean at the University of Texas at San Antonio\u2019s College of Public Policy. San Antonio added around 24,000 new residents between 2016 and 2017. That was the first time in recent history that San Antonio had been among the highest population growth cities in the country, Potter said.\n\nPotter said he thought last year that the city\u2019s growth may have been a one-year anomaly.\n\n\u201cBut now, with the second year in the row, we\u2019re up there with the most significant growing cities in the country,\u201d he said.\n\nHowever, such significant population increases come with implications, Potter said.\n\n\u201cCertainly we have been growing and been managing our growth fairly well, though some people who live in the northern suburbs might argue with that,\u201d Potter said. \u201cBut it does create challenges for us. If we\u2019re growing and more than other cities, we have to also grow our infrastructure \u2013 roads, power, water. \u2026 Then there are issues of schools, and things like that as well.\u201d\n\nMayor Ron Nirenberg took the census numbers as a warning to continue to prioritize things such as street maintenance, economic development, and transportation. He said the City has continued to address affordable housing needs, as well as funding job training and early childhood education.\n\n\u201cThese are all issues that dramatic growth will bring to the forefront, and we are working to stay ahead of the curve,\u201d Nirenberg said in a statement.\n\nNirenberg said he was confident in the city\u2019s direction to manage that growth.\n\n\u201cThe census numbers show San Antonio\u2019s rapid growth is continuing as expected with record low unemployment, and the data demonstrate that the course we have set on City Council in the last two years is the right approach,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nNew Braunfels also saw significant growth with a 7.2 percent increase in its population, or about 5,700 new people. It secured the No. 2 spot among cities with the most growth by percentage on the Census Bureau report.\n\nNew Braunfels has historically been near the top of that list, and the cities along Interstate 35 typically see significant growth as well, Pottery said. Austin was sixth on the list of cities with the largest population increase, with 12,504 new residents.\n\n\u201cYou have Austin growing, San Antonio at the top of the list, and cities all in between in terms of top of list for pace of growth,\u201d Potter said. \u201cYou really continue to see this sort of integration of the economies of Austin and San Antonio and really through the I-35 corridor.\u201d\n\nAs San Antonio\u2019s population continues to grow, future city leaders must plan to sustain that growth, Potter said.\n\n\u201cThat is essentially their job,\u201d he said. \u201cHopefully they are up to the challenge and able to do that in a way that ensures our quality of life is maintained.\u201d", "title": "San Antonio Ranked Again Among Fastest-Growing Cities in U.S.", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['San Antonio']"}, {"id": 107, "city": "San Antonio", "url": "https://therivardreport.com/san-antonio-to-ban-scooters-from-sidewalk-city-opens-bids-to-select-3-vendors/", "text": "The seven scooter companies operating a total of about 16,000 dockless electric vehicles in San Antonio have four months to prove they should be allowed to stay in the city, and scooterists have a month before they\u2019re banned from riding on the sidewalk, San Antonio City Council decided Thursday.\n\nBy early October, a city government bidding process will pare the number of authorized operators to three and the number of vehicles to 5,000. On June 30, riding on the sidewalk will be prohibited.\n\nBy virtue of Thursday\u2019s vote, the pilot program under which scooter companies were previously operating has been extended until Sept. 30.\n\nThe measure also reduced by half the number of authorized vehicles for companies that are permitted for 1,000 vehicles or more. For example, Lime, which had been approved for 4,000 scooters, will see its fleet reduced to 2,000. That would bring the total number of permitted vehicles down to 8,750, although the average number of vehicles available for use on city streets has been around 6,000.\n\nCouncil was set to consider barring scooter use on sidewalks this fall, along with its selection of three scooter companies, but Councilman John Courage (D9) tossed in an amendment to issue the ban beginning June 30.\n\n\u201cIt really is a matter of safety,\u201d Courage said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t talked about how many accidents have taken place recently. \u2026 Obviously, it\u2019s a problem with [scooter riders] on the sidewalks. Let\u2019s alleviate that problem right away.\u201d\n\nMore than 150 scooter-related accidents have been reported to the City\u2019s Emergency Medical Services since October, although they have decreased by 36 percent since the City implemented an 11 p.m. curfew for riding scooters in February.\n\nBeginning its regulation of the nascent scooter-share industry with a light-touch approach, the City later shifted its rules in response to an increasing number of reported injuries and complaints about sidewalk clutter.\n\nCouncilman Manny Pelaez (D8), who has railed in recent months against the proliferation of dockless vehicles, voted in favor of the government bidding process but remained concerned that a 5,000-vehicle limit would not fix what he sees as a problem.\n\n\u201cI still think 5,000 is too much,\u201d Pelaez said. \u201c\u2026 I\u2019m hesitant, and I\u2019m a little scared of what 5,000 might look like.

The vehicles can be rented using a smartphone with rates of $1 to unlock the scooters and 15 cents for every minute of usage.\n\nThe company \u2013 along with other providers throughout the country \u2013 had operated with a forgiveness-not-permission mentality, putting vehicles on the street overnight without notifying government officials.\n\nThe City of San Antonio enacted a pilot program in response to the growing fleet of the sharable electric vehicles. The pilot began last fall with a required permit application for companies wanting to operate in the City but no cap on the number of vehicles citywide. The number of authorized companies grew to seven before the City issued a moratorium on additional permits. Permitting fees will be prorated through the extension of the pilot program.\n\nReflecting on the increasingly contentious scooter issue, Mayor Ron Nirenberg said the problem was exacerbated by inadequate infrastructure.\n\n\u201cThis is our need for a market that drives innovation and transportation colliding with the fact that we\u2019ve made really bad decisions about how to deal with our transportation infrastructure in the city,\u201d he said.\n\nThe City will solicit bids from scooter companies beginning June 7.

What to do about a humanitarian crisis with no end in sight remains the subject of partisan debate and gridlock in the nation\u2019s capital. President Trump\u2019s latest proposal appears to be falling flat with both Republicans and Democrats in Congress.\n\nHere in San Antonio, the gateway city on the road north to a new life for migrants, there is no time or space for such standoffs. A City-directed network of municipal staffers, nonprofits, and church volunteers is welcoming a daily wave of asylum-seekers released by federal authorities along the border and put on buses or private shuttles bound for the downtown Greyhound station.\n\nSan Antonio has never declared itself a sanctuary city, but it is a city that has always offered sanctuary to people in need, from Mexicans fleeing revolution in the early 20th century to New Orleans residents displaced by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and, now, fleeing Central Americans. A city with a majority Mexican-American population has a culture and history rooted in migration.\n\n\u201cSan Antonio is a city of compassion that has always been a ray of hope in both the good and the tough times,\u201d Mayor Ron Nirenberg said Wednesday after touring the resource center. \u201cOur city has never hesitated to embrace anyone needing a place of refuge.

Other days, the number flares to 200 or more. Officials here experienced a surge in late March that overwhelmed Catholic Charities and its volunteers, leading city officials to step in and broaden the city\u2019s response.\n\n\u201cTogether with our community partners, the City of San Antonio is humanely treating people who are here legally and going through the asylum seeking process,\u201d said City Manager Erik Walsh. \u201cI\u2019m proud that the City and our community has stepped up to help those in need as they travel through San Antonio.\u201d\n\nAsylum-seekers line up in a hallway at Travis Park Church to get their room assignments.

April saw 4,000 arrivals locally, while border authorities say they are detaining that many or more on a daily basis in the Rio Grande Valley.\n\nThe number of migrant crossings and detentions along the border changes by the day. One day last week a federal official said 14,000 asylum-seekers were awaiting processing that day in detention centers, tent camps, and other makeshift facilities. The next day, that count grew to 18,000. Another official told me weeks ago that more than 100,000 asylum-seekers had been detained and processed since the start of the year. He was contradicted by another official who said more than 200,000 had crossed in March and April. The numbers, however inaccurate, reflect an overwhelmed ICE and Border Patrol.\n\nNuns and lay workers with the InterFaith Welcoming Coalition, formed here in 2014 as the first waves of unaccompanied children began crossing the border, greet arriving families and unaccompanied women. The bus station\u2019s 24-hour lighting is harsh, its seating uncomfortable, but for the migrants it looks and feels like freedom. It\u2019s their first stop en route to a new life, far from the gangs, corrupt police, and violence and poverty they have fled in El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala.\n\n\u201cThe migrants arrive only with the clothes they are wearing and what they can carry. And what they can carry in most cases is their young children,\u201d said Dr. Colleen Bridger, the city\u2019s senior public health official who oversees San Antonio\u2019s humanitarian, medical, and shelter response. \u201cWe get no help or funding from Washington, even though we are, in effect, acting as an extension of the federal government by processing and providing vital services to these asylum seekers, who are here legally, on to their final destination.\u201d\n\nEach arriving adult receives a new backpack with a Red Cross blanket, a bag of 20 snacks, soap and toiletries, crayons and a coloring book, a small stuffed animal, a used English-Spanish paperback dictionary, and a reusable water bottle. Sanitary products, over the counter medicines, and diapers are distributed as needed.\n\nBilingual relief workers escort the migrants on a short walk from the bus station to a Migrant Resource Center, formerly a vacant office in a city parking garage.

Jesus was a migrant. To me, it\u2019s not a debatable theology. God calls us to love our neighbors. The Greyhound bus station and all the people moving it through it are our neighbors.\u201d\n\nA few fortunate migrants with family or friends in the United States who can afford airfare will board flights one day after arriving in San Antonio. Most face one to two days of bus travel, with many stops, layovers, and bus changes. Bilingual maps help the migrants understand travel routes, geographic destinations, and how to navigate stops and transfers. The migrants guard bus tickets and documents establishing their legal status as asylum-seekers with distant court dates like treasure.\n\nThe aging church hall is a warren of rooms crammed with cots, a safe haven for the migrants who retire early \u2013 lights out at 9:30 p.m. \u2013 with plans for early morning departures. Children hyped up by the sudden change in conditions after the long trip north and time in detention camps keep fatigued adults from their sleep.\n\nI spent the evening speaking with migrants, listening as they shared harrowing stories that led them to flee their homelands, d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for a reporter who lived in Central America in the early 1980s, covering the region\u2019s civil wars. The lawlessness and political chaos that has reverberated down over the years now provides the setting that so many impoverished and threatened people are desperate to escape, no matter how long or dangerous the journey.\n\nThe Trump administration\u2019s punitive cutoff of funds to the region\u2019s agencies working to stabilize conditions there is only expected to add to the mayhem and the growing numbers of U.S.-bound asylum-seekers who have credible reason to fear for their lives at home.\n\nHeidi Serrano, 20, a graphics designer and third-year university student, arrived here 70 days after fleeing her home in El Progreso outside San Pedro Sula, Honduras. She did so after being threatened by a local policeman who showed up at her door one night and demanded weekly protection payment of 1,500 lempiras, about $60.\n\n\u201cHe said he knew my family must have money if I was attending a private university, but I was there on a scholarship,\u201d Serrano said. \u201cSomeone I know must have been part of extortion plan. They gave the policeman my cellphone number and he began to track me. He finally told me he would kill me if I didn\u2019t have the money for him by the next day. I fled at dawn.\u201d\n\nJeremy Herrera Mendoza, a slightly built 12-year-old Guatemalan boy, said he was leaving school one day in March when three men who identified themselves as members of La Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, approached him with a choice.\n\n\u201cThey told me they knew where I lived and I could either join their gang or they would kill my mother and younger brother,\u201d Jeremy said.\n\nThe vicious street gang controls many of the poor urban neighborhoods in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Jeremy decided not to tell his mother, Karen Mendoza Centeno, 33, about the threat, and for the next week he hid out in Guatemala City, skipping school to avoid gang members. School officials contacted his mother to ask why one of their top-achieving students was no longer attending classes, forcing Jeremy to return to school where the men once again confronted him and gave him one day to decide whether to join the gang or lose his own life.\n\nJeremy went home and broke down crying as he told his mother the truth. She took him to local authorities, where he gave a sworn deposition documenting the gang threat. She carried the papers with her as proof in her quest for asylum.\n\nLocal officials said they could not protect the family, so Mendoza, Jeremy, and 9-year-old Abrah\u00e1m boarded the first bus the next morning bound for Mexico, abandoning their home and all their belongings. Their journey turned treacherous at the U.S.-Mexico border after U.S. Customs workers in El Paso denied them entry.\n\n\u201cThey said there were too many people from Central America seeking asylum, and even if someone told us we have the right to apply, they were not going to let us in,\u201d Mendoza said. \u201cWe took a bus to Nuevo Laredo and lived on the streets for three days, but a policeman told us the Zetas controlled the city and we had better leave.\u201d\n\nMateo Perez, 57, a family friend living and working in Louisville, wired $2,500 to Mendoza, which she paid to a coyote to smuggle them across the Rio Grande on tire tubes from Piedras Negras to Eagle Pass. Shortly after crossing, the Border Patrol detained them. One month after their departure from Guatemala they were finally in the United States and, after a stop in San Antonio, would be on their way to Kentucky to live with Perez, who Mendoza said is like his godfather.\n\nBridger said San Antonio\u2019s efforts to deliver comprehensive services to the arriving migrants is straining local budgets, but the city does not intend to curtail services, regardless of how long the humanitarian crisis continues.\n\n\u201cAt first we said, \u2018Let\u2019s gear up for a two-week response,\u2019\u201d she said, \u201cbut that was in late March. This is not a two-week crisis. It\u2019s not getting any better.

The bee club recently harvested honey on a cloudy day and the bees \u201cwere not happy.\u201d But it was a cool experience, she said.\n\nCecile Parrish, 29, an urban farm manager at Eco Centro, a community outreach center for environmental sustainability, ranks as a master beekeeper, someone well-trained in apiary skills. She\u2019s planning to stage beekeeping workshops at Eco Centro and suggests the reason millennials are attracted to urban beekeeping is \u201cwanting to find something tangible to do\u201d about pollinator decline.\n\n\u201cA lot of times, people don\u2019t feel empowered to do something, but with beekeeping, you can,\u201d Parrish said.\n\nThe surge of interest in urban beekeeping occurs at a time when the commercial side of the pursuit faces serious obstacles. Beekeepers who make their living growing bees, beeswax, or honey have had an especially tough year, with some losing 40 percent to 50 percent of their hives, according to some reports. Varroa mites and small hive beetles combined with a changing climate and colony collapse disorder have caused many small beekeeping businesses to consolidate or shut down.\n\nTexas hosts an estimated 200 commercial beehives, according to Mary Reed, chief apiary inspector for the state of Texas. Reed\u2019s staff of four is charged with controlling disease in commercial operations, focusing mostly on bees that cross state lines, as occurs when Texas beekeepers take their hives to California to assist with the almond harvest. Reed said she\u2019s noticed \u201chuge growth\u201d in small-scale beekeeping.\n\nBeekeeping has become a backyard hobby for many San Antonio residents. Credit: Scott Ball / Rivard Report\n\n\u201cIn the last couple of years, we\u2019ve certainly had a lot of commercial beekeepers decide they just don\u2019t want to do this any more, because there\u2019s too much stress associated with it,\u201d she said.\n\nVarroa mites are the biggest problem, she and other apiary experts agree. Since the parasites arrived from Florida in the 1980s, they have become the primary threat to honeybees, weakening the population and spreading viruses.\n\nWhile all beekeepers battle parasites, disease, pesticides, and unpredictable weather, backyard beekeepers sometimes face unique urban challenges.\n\nLiz Rendon, 56, an IT manager at UT Health San Antonio, and her beekeeping mentor, Richard Trevi\u00f1o, were conducting a routine hive check in her backyard across from the Southtown Belgian restaurant La Frite one summer afternoon in 2011 when she spotted an oddly colored honeycomb. \u201cWhat could that be?\u201d she wondered aloud as bright red and neon green honey spilled from the frame she lifted for inspection.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s Big Red and Mountain Dew honey,\u201d said Trevi\u00f1o.\n\nEven though lush gardens existed close by and the San Antonio River beckoned a few blocks away with blooming native plants, Rendon\u2019s bees were dumpster-diving. Bees will forage for nectar and other sweet liquid carbohydrates wherever they can find them, usually within a mile or two of their hive. \u201cThe bees will be lazy if they can be,\u201d said Rendon.\n\nThe incident motivated Rendon to move her hives out of downtown to a friend\u2019s property in Pleasanton. Now she tends hives there and elsewhere.\n\nLiz Rendon and her father, Lee Leffingwell, service a beehive on Leffingwell\u2019s property along the Guadalupe River. Credit: Courtesy / Al Rendon\n\nAn amendment to the State Tax Code in 2012 has made such arrangements beneficial for urban beekeepers and landowners. Anyone with 5 acres or more can qualify for agriculture valuations on their property taxes by raising bees. Rules vary by county about the ratio of beehives per acre. In Bexar County, landowners with between 5 and 20 acres can raise six to 12 hives to take advantage of the tax exemption.\n\nThat\u2019s how Rendon has managed to grow her hives from two downtown to more than half a dozen at two separate properties a 15-minute drive from her house. Most weekends, you\u2019ll find her at \u201cthe Luckey,\u201d a 100-acre plot owned by a friend who has granted her beekeeping rights. Another pal encouraged Rendon to set up beehives on his 16 acres to take advantage of the ag exemption.\n\nRendon finds solace in keeping bees, admiring their \u201cbeautifully cooperative nature.\u201d Even though she is allergic to bee stings and wears two pairs of jeans and double sets of gloves to protect herself when she checks her hives, she can\u2019t resist their calming buzz. And sharing homegrown honey with friends gives her a sense of pleasure and peace.\n\n\u201cEven opening the hive is meditative,\u201d she said.\n\nA beekeeper removes honeycomb frames during a routine beehive check.

The inclusion of a micromobility lane for bikes and e-scooters as a part of the Broadway Street redevelopment project \u2013 a project supported by Mayor Ron Nirenberg \u2013 could be a catalyst for urban design that promotes public health. But the benefits can only be reaped if every zip code is included, starting with the most disadvantaged.\n\nResearch has found land use mix, minutes in a car, and distance walked as significant indicators of Body Mass Index (BMI) across all gender and ethnic groups, underscoring the importance of urban design. However, the urban design of San Antonio discourages physical activity, prioritizing drivers over walkers or bikers. Without protected bike lanes, well-maintained sidewalks, and reduced vehicle lanes, San Antonio scores 131.2 on the Pedestrian Danger Index in comparison to the national average of 55.3.\n\nAccording to the Active Living Council of San Antonio, 75 percent of Bexar county adults do not meet the 150-minute moderate-to-vigorous weekly physical activity requirement as cited by the Center for Health Statistics. While individual choices play a part, we must understand individual choices in the context of environment.\n\nIn Bexar County 65.7 percent of our adults and 32 percent of our adolescents are overweight or obese. What is even more alarming, is that the prevalence of obesity in Bexar County is disproportionately concentrated in the inner city (inside loop 410) and Southwest and Southside school districts. Not coincidentally, these areas, including zip codes 78202 and 78207, experience the city\u2019s highest concentrations of low-income and uninsured individuals.\n\nHealth care, however, is only one factor contributing to good health and its impact is limited. Decades of compelling research suggests that social determinants such as physical environment, socioeconomic status, education, and social networks play an overwhelmingly important role in explaining our health status.\n\nYet, the zip codes with the most to gain from multimodal streets are not being included. While the road north of Interstate 35 to Hildebrand Avenue is included in these plans, the mile leading south into downtown from Interstate 35 extending access to 78202 is not. The obesity rate in San Antonio cannot be expected to change if intervention is not applied to areas experiencing the highest prevalence. All San Antonio citizens should get easy access to health-promoting neighborhood conditions that support us in reaching and maintaining healthy BMI, but we need to start with neighborhoods that need the most support.\n\nIt\u2019s time we get serious about our health and the implementation of non-motorized linkages between residential, commercial, and employment areas as one important approach to improving the health of all San Antonio residents. Promoting active living spaces is important because evidence from Texas studies shows that school-based intervention promoting biking for students and parents has resulted in significantly increased recreational activity. Implementing urban design that promotes physical activity will simultaneously foster safety, equality, social cohesion, economic vibrancy, clean air, and employment in San Antonio.\n\nSan Antonio has already implemented an effective model of social and environmental change for public health. More than a decade ago, neighborhood groups, business associations, and residents joined together to support a tobacco ban in public areas. Preventing health risks attributed to obesity in the same way tobacco was identified as a leading cause of preventable disease must be a priority of San Antonio. Tobacco limits imposed from 2010 to June 2019 prioritize the health of those under 21 with limited restrictions of civil liberties for adults who choose to smoke. Our children deserve the same environmental protections from obesity as they do from tobacco.\n\nThe obesity epidemic will require changes social, economic, and built environments; the choice is to modify our society to accommodate obesity or health. Obesity intervention requires a social change from the individual to the collective. When we choose to value our health as well as our health care, we will collectively reap the physical, economic, and social benefits of health equity.", "title": "San Antonio Urban Design Paves a Path Toward Widespread Obesity", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['San Antonio']"}, {"id": 112, "city": "San Diego", "url": "https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-big-cities-housing-plans-san-diego-20190225-story.html", "text": "San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer thinks his city has said \u201cno\u201d to housing for too long.\n\nWhere it once grew by sprawling \u2014 with political leaders in the middle of the last century annexing hundreds of square miles from the San Pasqual Valley near Cleveland National Forest to the border with Mexico \u2014 today San Diego is planning for an urban development boom so people don\u2019t have to drive to work.\n\nFor the record: An earlier version of this article said residents living near San Diego\u2019s Balboa Park protested a proposed 20-story condominium complex by wearing all black and holding up black umbrellas. The residents were protesting a 20-story apartment complex.\n\nBut that growth hasn\u2019t happened yet, and the city\u2019s housing costs are escalating.\n\nSo in his State of the City address in January, Faulconer proposed some of the most aggressive strategies of any California city to promote apartment and condominium construction. For San Diego residents to live affordably, the mayor said, the city must stop obliging long-held community demands to keep buildings short and stop requiring new parking spots so people have more places to live.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe must change from a city that shouts \u2018Not in My Backyard\u2019 to one that proclaims \u2018Yes in My Backyard!\u2019 \u201d Faulconer said in the speech.\n\nThe mayor\u2019s plans are part of a broader shift taking place in larger cities across California to promote growth, especially near transit stops. They also align with a push by Gov. Gavin Newsom and some state lawmakers to crack down on local development restrictions, which they believe are a major driver of California\u2019s rising housing costs amid continued calls by neighborhood groups to shrink or deny building projects.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question that larger cities in California are taking aggressive steps,\u201d said Bill Fulton, publisher of the California Planning and Development Report. \u201cThat\u2019s really accelerated in recent years as housing has become more of an issue.\u201d\n\nAfter Huntington Beach lawsuit, Newsom warns cities he\u2019ll continue housing law crackdown \u00bb\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn December, San Francisco got rid of requirements for developers to install parking spots alongside new homes across the city. In the same month, Sacramento passed a plan to phase out car-centered developments, such as fast food drive-through restaurants, in the city\u2019s downtown and other areas near transit \u2014 part of a bid to make it easier to build apartments and condominiums. And nearly three years ago, Los Angeles voters passed a plan that allows developers to build taller and more densely and receive permits more quickly for projects near Metro stations that set aside some units for low-income residents.\n\nLike the rest of the state, San Diego has seen dramatic increases in housing costs. In just the last six years, median home values in the city have gone up more than 70% to $633,500, according to the real estate website Zillow. Rental prices have also steadily increased over a similar period with the median cost now $1,642, according to U.S. Census data.\n\nHome prices in San Diego and California have steadily risen during the last six years. (Jon Schleuss / Los Angeles Times)\n\nThe median rent in San Diego is higher than the state median. (Jon Schleuss / Los Angeles Times)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe price surge prompted Faulconer to change his mind about some of the city\u2019s rules.\n\nYears ago, the mayor was such a staunch supporter of height limits \u2014 which control what type of developments are built \u2014 that he laughed at the idea they could make housing less available for people who want to live in San Diego. Now, he wants to get rid of height limits for apartment and condominium projects within a half-mile of transit stops. (The mayor\u2019s plan wouldn\u2019t apply along the coastline, where voters have enshrined a 30-foot height limit in the city charter.)\n\nFaulconer has also proposed doing away with requirements that developers include parking with projects in areas near transit, rules city officials now estimate drive up costs by as much as $90,000 per spot. And Faulconer wants to relax limits on the number of homes that can be built on sites near transportation hubs.\n\nBy getting rid of these restrictions, Faulconer said, developers will build more homes for people of all incomes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cYou either have a housing crisis or you don\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u201cWe know that we need to increase our ability to produce housing that San Diegans can afford. So let\u2019s act like it.\u201d\n\nSan Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer wants to strip away many local restrictions on development. \u201cWe know that we need to increase our ability to produce housing that San Diegans can afford,\u201d he said. (Allen J. Schaben / Los Angeles Times)\n\nSan Diego, California\u2019s second-largest city, is one of the few urban areas where Republicans like Faulconer retain considerable political power. But the mayor and City Council President Georgette Gomez, a Democrat, agree on the need for more growth, a perspective shared by council members from both parties. During a City Council meeting last month, Gomez chided a developer for proposing a project she believed was too small.\n\nThe proposals in San Diego coincide with the governor\u2019s recent efforts to reward cities that make it easy to build and punish those that don\u2019t. Last month, Newsom authorized a lawsuit against the Orange County city of Huntington Beach over state requirements to zone land for housing and on Tuesday the governor warned elected officials from nearly two dozen cities that they could be next.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNewsom also recently named Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg to lead a new commission on homelessness in a sign of support for the city\u2019s approach to housing.\n\nSteinberg, a former leader of the state Senate, said many local officials fiercely protect their control over development from state incursions. But he said that approach is the wrong one if city and county officials don\u2019t use their power to tackle housing affordability.\n\n\u201cCities should be doing more of these things on their own,\u201d Steinberg said. \u201cThat\u2019s the way it should be.\u201d\n\nIn San Diego, resistance to Faulconer\u2019s plans \u2014 which are in various stages of approval \u2014 is bubbling. Three trolley stops are under construction in neighborhoods surrounding Mission Bay and residents have fought for years against relaxing nearby height restrictions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn one side of the trolley is Interstate 5 and the bay. On the other, car dealerships and one- and two-story businesses line a commercial corridor. An abandoned department store sits next to one of the new trolley stations, and a developer has discussed using the site to build 1,700 new homes in buildings up to 90 feet tall. A few blocks inland, single-family homes rise along a broad hillside.\n\nIn front of some of those homes are lawn signs that read \u201cRaise the Balloon,\u201d referring to a slow-growth group founded in 2014 by Bay Park resident and Realtor James LaMattery. LaMattery said he was astounded that the city was considering allowing taller buildings in his neighborhood and convened protesters to lift a 10-foot-in-diameter red helium balloon over five stories high to show how residents\u2019 views would be affected.\n\n\u201cIt was like raising the American flag,\u201d said LaMattery, 66.\n\nIn making his pitch for growth, Faulconer has branded himself a \u201cYIMBY,\u201d which stands for \u201cYes in My Backyard,\u201d a national movement agitating for more development that is led primarily by young professionals.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLaMattery takes issue with those who would label him the opposite: a NIMBY, or \u201cNot in My Backyard,\u201d for being against some forms of development.\n\nIn an email to supporters last year, LaMattery wrote that NIMBY \u201csounds hauntingly familiar to other classes of people that suffer institutionalized discrimination. This \u2018N\u2019 word should be added to the protected classes in anti-discrimination bills and removed from governmental documents.\u201d\n\nAsked about the email, LaMattery said it was \u201cprobably inappropriate\u201d to compare the term to a racial slur. But he maintained that NIMBY was a derogatory term for those who are simply attempting to shape their communities.\n\nFaulconer\u2019s plan would do away with the height limits that LaMattery\u2019s group has worked to protect. LaMattery said the resulting development would be out of scale with the rest of the neighborhood and would unalterably change the city for the worse.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s going to be a huge battle,\u201d he said. \u201cA lot of San Diegans believe this is just a lot of L.A. development coming in.\u201d\n\nJames LaMattery, shown in 2016, opposes San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer\u2019s plans to allow for taller developments in his neighborhood. (Howard Lipin / San Diego Union-Tribune)\n\nWhile community groups reacted immediately when Faulconer introduced his plan at the State of the City, political leaders did not. The lack of response stunned Cory Briggs, a prominent local environmental attorney, who then decided to run for mayor in 2020 on a platform against aggressive growth.\n\nBriggs said Faulconer\u2019s proposal would run roughshod over neighborhood planning and lead to the construction of expensive developments unavailable to those who aren\u2019t wealthy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no housing crisis,\u201d Briggs said. \u201cThere\u2019s a workforce housing crisis, an affordable housing crisis.\u201d\n\nAcademic research indicates that new supply makes housing more affordable across a region, but that might not happen in individual neighborhoods when zoning rules are relaxed.\n\nGomez and Faulconer don\u2019t have exactly the same beliefs on housing and seem headed for a clash over what percentage of development must be reserved for low-income residents if height limits go away. The mayor\u2019s initial plan calls for no change to the city\u2019s current rules that can require 10% of a project to be for low-income residents. Gomez thinks that percentage should be higher.\n\n\u201cIf we are amending the regulations, what are the benefits?\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to support a project that is market-rate and have it just be market-rate. Because we\u2019re not addressing the need for people living in the streets.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite this divergence, city leaders remain in favor of new building \u2014 even in the face of inventive protests.\n\nDozens of residents living near a proposed 20-story apartment complex next to the city\u2019s Balboa Park dressed in all black and held up black umbrellas on a playing field that they believed would be covered in shadows if the towering development were approved. The idea came from a successful protest spearheaded by former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis in the late 1980s in New York City against a development that would have shaded an area of Central Park.\n\nThe council met for nearly two hours to debate the development three weeks ago. It was approved unanimously.\n\nliam.dillon@latimes.com\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwitter: @dillonliam", "title": "After decades of suburban sprawl, San Diego eyes big shift to dense development", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['San Diego']"}, {"id": 113, "city": "San Diego", "url": "https://sandiegodowntownnews.com/counting-on-san-diegos-urban-forest/", "text": "By DELLE WILLETT | Uptown News\n\nWhen landscape architect Tomas Herrera-Mishler came to San Diego four years ago to be CEO and president of the newly formed Balboa Park Conservancy, he was astounded that the park didn\u2019t have an updated tree inventory.\n\nThe last one was done by hand 20 years ago, taking seven years to do. Not having any of the technology that we have now, it was shelved, and the information was never updated, attributable to a lack of manpower in the city of San Diego\u2019s Parks & Recreation Department.\n\nShortly after Herrera-Mishler arrived, with the help of a steering committee of industry experts, key stakeholders, and Parks & Rec staff, funding was identified to update the inventory, resulting in the hiring of Davey Resource Group, Inc.\n\nWe all know Balboa Park as a place with museums, restaurants and gardens. But it\u2019s really more than that. It\u2019s San Diego\u2019s arboretum, an urban forest with immense, widespread influence. Its diversity of tree species helps filter air and water, control storm water, conserve energy, and provide animal habitat and shade. And by reducing noise and providing places to recreate, it strengthens social cohesion, spurs community revitalization, and adds economic value to our communities.\n\nAlso, it is helping realize the San Diego Climate Action Plan, which has a lofty goal of 15% tree canopy by 2020 and 35% by 2035 for the whole city. (Balboa Park is at 30% but the city as a whole is at 5-6%.)\n\nUsing the data collected from the inventory, the objective is to develop and implement a management and reforestation plan for Balboa Park that includes replanting trees on an annual basis; increasing species diversity; experimenting with new plant introductions; propagating trees of historic and horticultural value; conserving unusual, rare and endangered trees; removing hazardous trees; maintaining and protecting trees; and interpreting park horticulture.\n\n\u201cThe incredible value of this new survey has given us a real understanding of the condition of the park,\u201d said Herrera-Mishler.\n\nTo direct the inventory and nine other projects, the conservancy brought in Jackie Higgins, a landscape architect skilled in management information technology and restoring climate-appropriate and native California landscapes. The tree inventory was managed under her leadership and oversight, focused on establishing a baseline of data for the park.\n\nUsing GIS and GPS, the Davey team conducted the tree inventory from June 2017 to April 2018, identifying 15,515 trees throughout the park, producing up-to-date real-time information on each tree.\n\nThe Davey team collected around 20 attributes per tree including GPS location, age, site information, species, size, condition, health maintenance, diameter at breast height (DBH), a photo of every tree, age of the urban forest and recommendations/tasks.\n\nThe conservancy also commissioned another baseline study of the economic impact of the park that identified the tangible economic benefits to the San Diego region.\n\nFor example, currently the forest\u2019s carbon storage is equivalent to annual carbon emissions from 5,770 autos, and the annual carbon emission from 2,370 single-family houses with a carbon storage value of $1,060,000. (Cash values determined by the U.S. Forestry Service.)\n\nExplained Higgins, \u201cThese 1,200 acres help to balance out the concrete jungle that we live in. Not only do we have to make sure that we are accounting for appropriate canopy cover for our parks, we are essentially taking on the burdens of all the other areas that can\u2019t have a canopy or other benefits that go along with that, for example, carbon sequestration, air filtration and purification, and stormwater mitigation.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re making progress,\u201d said Herrera-Mishler. \u201cOne of our goals is increasing the diversity of the trees in the park.\u201d\n\nHaving a broad diversity of trees is paramount for resilience from climate change and sickness. Twenty years ago, there were 348 different tree species in Balboa Park. Today there are 448, exactly 100 more. That\u2019s astounding, Herrera-Mishler said. \u201cAnd so now, with new technology, we are able to track exactly what species are doing well in San Diego with modern growing conditions. That\u2019s a valuable data set to share with the rest of Southern California.\u201d\n\nHerrera-Mishler, who is especially interested in historic landscapes, said \u201cThis urban forest is 100-years-plus [old] now, with Kate Sessions starting the process [in] the beginning of the last century. We now know precisely where the heritage trees are, the survivors that have weathered drought and climate change and air pollution and urbanization and smog and all those things.\u201d\n\nHerrera-Mishler thinks it\u2019s important to note that tree plantings in the park have always been public/private partnerships. Since the park\u2019s very beginnings, regular folks have planted trees at their own expense, some successful, some not. Today, every one of the newly planted trees is being monitored by teams of volunteers called Tree Stewards, who are trained to work with other conservancy volunteer groups to plant the trees according to a very rigorous standard, working alongside other groups and representatives from Parks & Rec. Currently there are 40 Tree Stewards who monitor trees on a real-time basis, checking soil moisture at the base of a new tree, helping to insure the survival of the trees. With more funding, the Tree Steward program can expand to monitor all 15,515 trees.\n\nSo far, in the 500 new trees they have planted in the last two years, through a grant from CalFire, there\u2019s a 98.4% survival rate. The success attributable for this rate is that Parks & Rec helped to get irrigation to the trees and the Urban Corp works with Tree Stewards and other volunteers to help with the installation of the trees.\n\nSaid Herrera-Mishler, \u201cThe conservancy is thinking about the park as a \u2018forever\u2019 asset for the community. It\u2019s really cool when your timeline is forever.\u201d\n\nAnyone interested in Balboa Park\u2019s trees and urban forest can Google \u201cOpen Tree Map\u201d and download the Open Tree Map app and choose \u201cSan Diego Tree Tracker Map\u201d within this app. Those interested in becoming Tree Stewards should visit balboaparkconservancy.org/project/tree-stewards/\n\n\u2014 Delle Willett has been a marketing and public relations professional for over 30 years, with an emphasis on conservation of the environment.

But Horton Plaza isn\u2019t just any mall.

When the plaza first opened, its narrow passageways were adorned with banners by Jerde\u2019s Olympics collaborators Deborah Sussman and Paul Prejza, creating a magenta-splashed encore of the design team\u2019s critically acclaimed triumph.\n\nThe mall was an undeniable success, and cities across the country took note, crafting their own entertainment districts meant to revitalize urban cores, which had been abandoned by decades of disinvestment. Many of these were designed by Jerde, who reliably dappled color and wit onto drab streetscapes from coast to coast.\n\nBut the paradox was that even as these downtowns became a magnet for new residents, shopping revenue, and foot traffic, the malls themselves did not fare as well. As Horton Plaza\u2019s anchor tenants fled, its developer, Westfield\u2014which has successfully resuscitated several malls\u2014waffled over redesign plans and ultimately sold the property.\n\nOn May 20, San Diego\u2019s City Council voted unanimously to allow new owners Stockdale Capital Partners to convert Horton Plaza into the Campus at Horton, a mixed-use development that will relocate all shops to the ground floor, reducing the retail space from 600,000 to 300,000 square feet, and add 772,000 square feet of office space. It will still be a mall, just with four floors of offices above.\n\nHowever, this plan does mean eradicating some of Jerde\u2019s most iconic postmodern creations. Highlights include a glorious faux bell tower (it used to be a Nordstrom) and a black-and-white-striped loggia encasing the escalators, with details that grow wackier and more exaggerated the deeper one ventures into the complex. These bold, grin-eliciting elements will be replaced with the prevailing look of America\u2019s late-capitalism era. You know the one.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m aware that the postmodern style is not in fashion,\u201d David Marshall, chair of AIA San Diego\u2019s preservation committee, told the Union-Tribune. \u201cVictorian houses were out of fashion in the \u201940s, \u201950s and \u201960s, and many were demolished. Today, they are appreciated. It\u2019s a matter of these buildings surviving those times when they\u2019re not in fashion.\u201d\n\nThis has been the challenge of protecting postmodernism in the U.S. Not only are the buildings often too young to be eligible for landmarking, the structures themselves must overcome aesthetic stereotypes.\n\nSimilar debates have played out around saving Philip Johnson\u2019s former AT&T building, Michael Graves\u2019s Portland Building, and the nearby Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, where a postmodern pergola completed in the 1990s by Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown will be erased by an Annabelle Selldorf-designed renovation.\n\nPreservationist group Docomomo mounted a campaign to protect Horton Plaza, urging San Diego\u2019s Historical Resources Board to consider it within the context of other treasured local buildings from the same era, like the Salk Institute and Geisel Library.\n\n\u201cHorton Plaza is one of the most significant examples of the postmodern style offering eclectic forms, color and excitement in a uniquely public shopping space,\u201d read Docomomo\u2019s letter to San Diego Mayor Kevin Falconer.\n\nSan Diegans seem to agree that more shopping space is no longer what\u2019s needed downtown. According to KPBS, \u201cfew people spoke in opposition to the new plan\u201d before the City Council vote. The Campus at Horton is one of a handful of tech campuses poised to remake the city\u2019s downtown yet again\u2014this time, in an attempt to lure plucky startups and young professionals priced out of California\u2019s troubled boom towns to the north.\n\nAnd malls are turning into tech hubs up and down the state. Google is leasing nearly all of the space in the Westside Pavilion, a mostly dead West LA mall from the same era as Horton Plaza, after a plan to redevelop the mall fell through. In Cupertino, near Apple\u2019s new campus, the long-dead Vallco Mall will be replaced with a mixed-use development that will add much-needed housing for local workers.\n\nOlder malls, particularly urban ones, have needed to be reimagined to regain their usefulness in changing communities. A decade ago, the city of Santa Monica decided to peel the roof off Santa Monica Place, a Frank Gehry-designed mall that opened in 1980, and use the shell as a tool to reinvigorate downtown Santa Monica. Gehry\u2019s signature PoMo moves\u2014like zig-zagging escalators and bright perforated-metal accents\u2014didn\u2019t survive the renovation, but now the courtyard has an even more important role as a public breezeway connecting the Third Street Promenade shopping district to the Expo Line light-rail station.\n\nThe architect who oversaw the overhaul? Jon Jerde. It was his last major project before he died in 2015.\n\nIn a 1986 New York Times review in which Paul Goldberger likens Horton Plaza\u2019s \u201cfreewheeling\u201d spirit to Disneyland and draws comparisons to Jerde\u2019s contemporaries like Graves and Charles Moore, Goldberger reveals a critical flaw in the mall\u2019s layout, which may have sealed its fate. \u201cIf it is the heart of downtown San Diego, it is a heart cut off from its body,\u201d he wrote, \u201cfor it has almost no connection with the surrounding streets.\u201d\n\nFor all its urban aspirations, Horton Plaza remains completely oriented around parking garages, walling off the streets around it, and turning its back completely on the Gaslamp Quarter, a nearby cluster of late-1800s buildings which Horton Plaza\u2019s presence helped flicker back to life.\n\nIn the same way Jerde brought daylight into Gehry\u2019s Santa Monica mall, the Campus at Horton will now be more permeable and accessible to the city around it. And the new renderings do show that one important aspect of the mall\u2019s design will be kept\u2014the diagonal passage that allows people to make a mid-block move through the development\u2014although with none of the delight of stumbling upon a whimsical checkerboard colonnade towering above.\n\nAs preservationists have argued, that central corridor is what\u2019s worth keeping, and it wouldn't be that hard to sculpt at least a few elements into more modernized storefronts. The best possible way to do this, of course, would be to get Jerde\u2019s firm\u2014which, as the mall expert, continues to sensitively update older malls\u2014to design it.\n\nOr there\u2019s always the alternative. At the edge of the Campus at Horton is one building that doesn\u2019t fit in among the slick reflective towers, almost looking like some kind of postmodern folly in itself. As part of the deal with the city, developers will be responsible for restoring this historic structure, known as the Bradley Building. However, this Bradley Building is actually a simulacra built in the 1980s\u2014after the original 1911 building was demolished to make way for Horton Plaza.\n\nPerhaps 30 more years down the road, the pendulum will swing completely in the other direction, much in the same way the blocks of once-unpopular Victorian-era structures have been preserved and painstakingly restored in the Gaslamp Quarter. The city will regret the glass transgressions of its Hudson-Yards-by-the-Sea and order Jerde\u2019s original PoMo flourishes to be resurrected, Bradley Building-style, through the center of the complex\u2014rightfully returning San Diego\u2019s most colorful landmark to its downtown.", "title": "Will this PoMo wonderland in San Diego be saved?", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['San Diego']"}, {"id": 116, "city": "San Diego", "url": "https://www.kpbs.org/news/2019/mar/04/city-council-urban-parking-minimum-housing/", "text": "San Diego City Council members Monday approved a sweeping set of reforms to the city's parking rules, intended to help wean the city off car dependence while also tackling the city's housing shortage.\n\nThe change will allow developers to construct apartment or condominium buildings with zero off-street parking spots if the housing is located within a half-mile of a major public transit stop. It will also place new requirements for developers to provide residents with \"transportation amenities\" such as subsidized public transit passes, bike repair stations or sidewalk improvements.\n\nMayor Kevin Faulconer, who has made housing regulatory reform a top priority for his final two years in office, told the council the city's parking requirements were outdated, and that they reduce the number of homes developers are able to include in their projects. He said one parking space can cost developers between $35,000 and $90,000.\n\n\"Those costs are then passed on to renters and buyers, making units less affordable for San Diego's working families, which are of course the lifeblood of our economy,\" he said.\n\nRELATED: Planning Commissioners Give Thumbs Up To Urban Parking Reforms\n\nThe reforms also state when parking is provided in housing near transit stops, it must be \"unbundled\" \u2014 rented or sold separately from the housing unit. Councilwoman Vivian Moreno said this would allow car-free households to save money.\n\n\"Once you have the option to buy a unit without a parking space for less money, it makes you weigh the cost of having a car versus finding other modes of transportation,\" she said.\n\nCouncilwoman Jen Campbell, whose District 2 includes some of San Diego's beach communities, was the only council member to vote against the proposal. She said the city's public transit was not yet effective or efficient enough to allow large numbers of San Diegans to live without cars.\n\n\"Not having parking with neither provide mass transit, nor will it directly provide more housing,\" she said. \"The removal of parking requirements should be one of the last steps in moving our city away from car-centric transit instead of one of the first.\"\n\nCity staffers said most new developments would likely still include some off-street parking, particularly in areas where demand is high and developers will face trouble renting or selling homes with no dedicated parking spaces.\n\nSimilar parking reforms have been approved in San Francisco, Sacramento, Portland, Seattle and several other cities.\n\nSan Diego City Council members have approved a sweeping set of reforms to the city's parking rules, intended to help wean the city off car dependence while also tackling the city's housing shortage.\n\nYou can hear this story and other local news every morning by subscribing to San Diego Stories, KPBS\u2019 daily news podcast.

That means the agency, long seen as a friend to downtown builders, will no longer have any authority over city projects.\n\nThe dramatic shift in circumstances ends a years-long legal battle between the city and Murtaza Baxamusa, a former Civic board member who sued the agency in April of 2015. Baxamusa, who is affiliated with the San Diego Building & Construction Trades Council was joined in his lawsuit by the organization, argued that the agency lacked meaningful oversight and was too tight with developers.\n\nIn the tentative settlement, reached Thursday night, Civic San Diego has agreed to cease its planning and permitting of downtown projects; it will also end its administration over the downtown parking district. Those functions will be transferred back to the city, pending approval of the settlement by City Council. The city is also on the hook for $725,000 in legal fees, according to the settlement terms.\n\n\u201cFollowing execution of this Agreement ... Civic San Diego will no longer operate as agent for the City for planning, permitting, and non-successor project management functions,\u201d the term sheet states.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite the mandated changes, the city disputes the accusations made in the lawsuit, and is not admitting that it engaged in anything unlawful. It\u2019s also framing the settlement as a positive way forward.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re pleased with this tentative settlement agreement which will elevate the planning and permitting services the city provides to our urban neighborhoods,\u201d said Katie Keach, a spokeswoman for the city of San Diego. \u201cThis agreement will enhance our efforts to tackle the housing crisis, create jobs and improve the quality of life in our communities.\u201d\n\nStill, the agreement marks a major turning point for San Diego\u2019s development community, which has relied on the agency for quick approvals. It could even dissuade brand-name firms from undertaking big projects in the region.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen you get projects that are larger in scope, when you have to dig down several levels, they take longer to build. If they take longer to get approved and longer to build, it\u2019s tougher to line up financing,\u201d said Jason Wood, a principal at development firm Cisterra.\n\nThat makes projects riskier, he said. As such, the settlement will affect how Cisterra approaches its downtown developments going forward, Wood added.\n\nThe prominent, international builder is currently working on San Diego\u2019s first Ritz-Carlton at the corner of Seventh Avenue and Market Street. The firm was also behind the Diamond View Tower overlooking Petco Park as well as Sempra Energy\u2019s new headquarters.\n\nCivic San Diego was formed as a city-owned nonprofit in 2012 to replace the Centre City Development Corp. and the Southeastern Economic Development Corp. The reorganization was necessitated by the statewide dissolution of redevelopment agencies that year. For roughly seven years, Civic has handled almost all of the permits for new residential towers, hotels and office buildings in the downtown region \u2014 leading to a noticeable explosion of cranes in the last few years.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe agency had been considered by analysts as a useful tool for growth. In its latest multifamily report, real estate investment and management firm Jones Lang LaSalle, or JLL, predicted downtown would remain a vibrant building location because of a straight-forward approval process through Civic.\n\nNow, however, Civic San Diego will become more of an economic development agency. Its powers are limited to handling the continued wind-down of the former redevelopment agency and running community investment programs. It is also still eligible to receive New Markets Tax Credit allocations, which are special tax credits awarded annually by the federal government.\n\nAndrew Phillips, interim president of Civic San Diego, said in a phone interview Friday morning that he remained enthusiastic about the agency\u2019s future, although he noted that some members of its 30-person staff, particularly the five people who work in planning, will be affected by the settlement. The director pointed to an ongoing effort to raise $50 million for a fund that would invest in middle income developments. Civic is currently lining up projects and investors for that fund, he said.\n\n\u201cThis settlement provides Civic San Diego the opportunity to focus greater attention and resources on executing our growth strategy within our New Markets Tax Credit and Community Lending Programs,\u201d Phillips said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHowever, Steve Coopersmith, the attorney for the plaintiff Baxamusa, characterized the settlement as an indictment against the way the agency was doing business.\n\n\"(Civic San Diego) was basically a tool for developers to get a rubber stamp on development,\u201d he said. \u201cThey absolutely got things done quickly, but the problem is they basically got things done for the developers that the folks on the board knew.\u201d\n\nNat Bosa, a major downtown builder and the chief executive of Bosa Development, vehemently denied any special treatment from Civic San Diego. But he did like working with the agency \u2014 a lot. Canadian based-Bosa Development builds in British Columbia, Alberta, Washington state and California. It recently completed the 216-condo tower Pacific Gate on E Street and is also building a 620-unit apartment building on Broadway, soon to be the tallest residential tower in the city.\n\n\u201cThey stack right up there,\u201d he said of Civic San Diego. \u201cThey were good.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCity Council will accept or reject the terms of the settlement at a yet-to-be-scheduled meeting.", "title": "San Diego\u2019s downtown planning agency stripped of power", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['San Diego']"}, {"id": 118, "city": "San Diego", "url": "https://www.10news.com/news/local-news/san-diego-city-council-to-vote-on-living-in-vehicles-ordinance-051419", "text": "SAN DIEGO (CNS and KGTV) - San Diego's City Council voted 6-3 Tuesday night to place restrictions on sleeping and living in vehicles on city streets and parking lots.\n\nThe vehicle habitation ordinance goes into effect immediately and restricts people from living in their vehicles anywhere within 500 feet of a school or residence.

Earlier today, the Environmental Systems Research Institute (Esri) presented the City with its 2019 President\u2019s Award at its annual User Conference.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re using technology in new and innovative ways to deliver better customer service to our residents and improve the lives of fellow San Diegans,\u201d said Mayor Kevin L. Faulconer. \u201cWhether it\u2019s reducing emergency response times, planning for future growth or fixing potholes through the \u2018Get It Done\u2019 app, geographic information systems are an integral part of city operations and provide the building blocks to leave behind a better San Diego than the one we inherited.\u201d\n\nGIS is mapping software which manages, displays and analyzes geographic and spatial data. The City uses it for critical services including 911 dispatch, the \u201cGet It Done\u201d app and street-related work order processing.\n\nEsri, a global market leader and supplier of GIS software, selected the City out of its 150,000 worldwide customers for its leadership and innovation in GIS technology. Former award winners include the American Red Cross, UPS, FEMA and the National Audubon Society. The award comes at a fitting time, as Esri is celebrating its 50th anniversary and the City was its first client.\n\n\u201cBeing recognized on an international stage is wonderful, but the real reward is delivering innovation and efficiencies to City services every day,\u201d said Jonathan Behnke, the City\u2019s Chief Information Officer. \u201cIn addition to celebrating all of our amazing GIS integrations and tools, Esri is using this recognition to remind the tech community of how important the City has been as a launchpad, developing innovative solutions to asset management, emergency response, risk assessment and spatial analytics.\u201d\n\nThe City first began using GIS in 1980. In 1984, it partnered with San Diego County to establish a regional GIS which evolved into the agency SanGIS. Launched in 1997, SanGIS is an online hub of geographical data that is stored and publicly available to download. It includes 396 data layers and 2.2 million landbase data items, including parcels of land, road segments, intersection points and address points.\n\nThe City has continued to use GIS for services including crime analysis, brush management, fire hazard assessment, planning and community development, traffic assessment and special event permitting. More than 2,500 City staff members rely directly on GIS data for their business decisions.\n\nWith new technologies rapidly developing, the City envisions using GIS to support unmanned aerial vehicles, new strategies in monitoring wildfires, augmented reality, improved crime analytics, as well as detailing curb spaces on streets to facilitate vehicle delivery and ride-share services, semi-autonomous vehicles, and vehicular and pedestrian safety.\n\nMore than 4,200 intelligent sensors are being installed on City streetlights as part of the Smart Streetlights program, collecting GIS data on pedestrian and vehicle movement, parked cars and other mobility information. The data will help with various services including pedestrian safety, directing drivers to open parking spaces and helping first responders during an emergency. The City will use GIS to continue advancing homeless support programs and serve as a collaborative data standard for regional planning.", "title": "City of San Diego wins international award for use of GIS technology", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['San Diego']"}, {"id": 120, "city": "San Diego", "url": "https://www.kusi.com/city-of-san-diego-announces-plans-for-250th-anniversary-celebrations/", "text": "City of San Diego announces plans for 250th anniversary celebrations\n\n\n\n\n\nSAN DIEGO (KUSI) \u2013 A group of local officials, leaders and representatives from the Kumeyaay Nation announced plans Tuesday to commemorate the city\u2019s 250th anniversary throughout the year.\n\nMayor Kevin Faulconer and Campo Kumeyaay Nation Vice Chair Paul Cuero Jr. were among the officials to announce three public events to celebrate the city\u2019s anniversary.

We want them to bring the materials back, but we\u2019re saying, \u2018It\u2019s OK. We understand if you\u2019re a little bit late,\u2019\u201d Jones said.\n\nThe Library Foundation expects the pardon of those fines to improve library access to locals in those communities.\n\n\u201cLibraries are known as the 'great equalizers' because we provide equal access for all patrons, regardless of their socio-economic status,\u201d said Jones. \u201cWiping the slate clean of outstanding fines means welcoming back many of the underserved patrons who most need our services.\u201d\n\nCate said libraries play a critical role in transforming communities. He, too, was happy to announce the fine forgiveness efforts across the city.\n\n\u201cI feel that banning a child from our public libraries due to an overdue book fine is unreasonable and contradictory to the mission of our libraries,\u201d said Cate at a news briefing Tuesday afternoon.\n\nThis process comes just nine months after the San Diego Public Library eliminated late fees for overdue books and resources. Materials and books checked out before July 1, 2018, were subject to a daily overdue fine ranging between 10 cents to $1, with maximum fines ranging from $5 to $100. If a fine surpassed $10, the library cardholder would be barred.\n\nWhile the forgiven fines allowed those barred to return to their local libraries, people who don\u2019t return items will still be charged the price to replace them.\n\n\u201cNow, moving forward, we don\u2019t charge overdue fines. We want you to bring the item back. If you don\u2019t bring it back, you have to pay for it. But we don\u2019t charge you that late fee every day,\u201d Jones said.\n\nThe public libraries have automatic renewals where books may be renewed up to five times. If the book isn\u2019t returned by then, Jones said the cardholder won\u2019t be able to check out new books in the meantime.\n\n\u201cBut you actually have another 30 days to bring it back before you\u2019re going to have to pay for it,\u201d Jones said.\n\nAccording to the city, a deep-dive into the process of collecting library fines showed that it costs the city more in staff time to collect those overdue library fees than the fees collected. The library collected $675,000 in fees each year, but spent nearly $1 million to collect those fees.\n\nCate said having library staffers dedicate their time to \u201cchasing minuscule library fines with little to show for it was a waste of taxpayer dollars.\u201d\n\nThe city\u2019s analysis also showed overdue fees were preventing locals from using library services, a press release from the city said.\n\n\u201cWe knew we needed to do something about that,\u201d Jones added. \u201cOfficially, today, I can say that no one has a library fine, anymore, which is very exciting.\u201d", "title": "City of San Diego Grants Library Fine Forgiveness to 130K Locals", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['San Diego']"}, {"id": 122, "city": "Dallas", "url": "https://www.dallasnews.com/news/2019/09/18/dallas-city-council-approves-budget-focused-on-retaining-hiring-cops/", "text": "The Dallas City Council on Wednesday unanimously approved a budget for the next fiscal year that bumps the pay for midcareer officers and adds an estimated 19 cops to the police force, without a tax rate hike.\n\nThe $1.44 billion general fund budget focuses largely on the retention and recruitment of Dallas police officers.

After several council members agreed, Deputy Mayor Pro Tem Adam McGough withdrew an amendment for additional implicit bias training.\n\n\"We don't have to spend every last penny,\" Kleinman said.\n\nThe total budget for the next fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, is $3.8 billion.\n\nCity Manager T.C. Broadnax initially pushed a tax hike, to 78 cents per $100 of valuation, which would have increased revenues by another $4.5 million. The strategy was to anticipate the Legislature's new restriction that caps cities' property tax revenue collection at only 3.5% above the previous year.\n\nBut strong opposition from council members prompted city officials to find other sources for savings. Council members then considered cuts to the proposed budgets of offices focused on human and social services. Broadnax instead proposed a compromise, which found savings in other areas of the budget.\n\nBroadnax said city officials \"had a few bumps and bruises\" during the budget process, and that he'll continue to talk to council members about how they can come to a consensus more quickly.\n\n1/3Class 368, the largest recruit class in DPD history, began their training at the Dallas Police Basic Academy in Dallas, Texas on Wednesday, September 18, 2019.

He said their efforts to recruit officers, and their decision last year to increase starting salaries, are working.\n\n\"The citizens of Dallas felt they were not protected. They are the ones who called you to action,\" Mata said. \"You are changing the pay policy so that we are no longer hiring those, training those and seeing other cities take them away. We are correcting something that has been broken for three-plus decades.\"\n\nThe $874.9 million public safety budget \u2014 which includes police, fire, emergency management, municipal courts, the marshal's office and the jail contract with Dallas County \u2014 makes up more than 60% of the general fund.\n\nPolice and fire budgets total about 58%, or $834 million.\n\nThe public safety budget also adds to the state-mandated $162 million contribution \u2014 a $5.2 million increase over last year's required amount \u2014 to the Dallas Police and Fire Pension System.\n\nCouncil members on Wednesday also approved a three-year $99.4 million meet-and-confer agreement that negotiates pay with police associations.\n\nMany council members said they were committed to making those public safety investments without a tax rate hike. Mayor Pro Tem Adam Medrano said that in his seven years passing a budget, it's the first time that the council \"worked together as a team.\"\n\nOther services\n\nWith a tight budget and less revenue coming in the next few years, Johnson acknowledged the budget didn't invest as much in infrastructure as he would have liked. Council member Jennifer Staubach Gates said she hopes council members invest more in streets in the coming years.\n\nSeveral members of the public also urged the council throughout the process to focus on tackling poverty in Dallas and criticized the elected officials for considering cuts to proposed budgets for social service offices.\n\nSara Mokuria \u2014 co-founder of Mothers Against Police Brutality and a member of Our City Our Budget, a coalition of activists calling for more social service funding \u2014 at the public hearing Wednesday morning blasted city officials for being focused on police above other significant needs.\n\n\"This budget, which we say is a public safety budget, should be an anti-poverty budget,\" Mokuria said.\n\nThe budget included a few minor changes, such as additional Wi-Fi hot spots for $238,000 in an amendment by Jaime Resendez, three more senior planners for $210,000 in an amendment by Chad West, and $1.2 million for 15 firefighters to work at Fire Station 18. Another $1.5 million would be used for Park and Recreation's youth access and after-school programs.\n\nBut during the briefing, Narvaez said \"every single penny\" of the $40 million added to the budget went to public safety.\n\n\"We didn't get to do anything different, and that's the hard part,\" Narvaez said. \"This time around public safety wins out, and it should because our first responders are putting their lives on the line, and they deserve these dollars.\"\n\nCORRECTION, 4:52 p.m., Sept. 18, 2019: An earlier version of this story misstated the total budget as $4.04 billion. It is $3.8 billion.", "title": "Dallas City Council approves budget focused on retaining, hiring cops", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Dallas']"}, {"id": 123, "city": "Dallas", "url": "https://www.dmagazine.com/frontburner/2019/06/the-city-of-dallas-is-finally-taking-its-tree-canopy-seriously/", "text": "Dallas has a $9 billion asset that it hasn\u2019t been properly managing. The public learned that the hard way earlier this month, when 70 mile-per-hour winds shot down into the earth and uprooted thousands of mature trees all over the city. They fell on power lines and homes and vehicles and utility poles. What were once oaks and cottonwoods and pecans were turned into browning piles, stacked neatly near curbs awaiting their future as mulch.\n\nWe know the city\u2019s urban canopy is worth $9 billion because the nonprofit Texas Trees Foundation raised enough money to study how many trees exist in the city (14.7 million), how they\u2019re distributed (37 percent are south of I-30), and the environmental benefits these bring us (the annual capture of almost 60 million cubic feet of stormwater runoff\u2014that saves $4 million in repairs\u2014and storage of 2 million tons of carbon\u2014that\u2019s good for $137 million in savings).\n\nThe next step is something that the city has never had: an Urban Forest Management Plan, which would establish processes for keeping the existing trees healthy, identify the best places to plant additional trees to mitigate heat, and possibly reassign city staff to better maintain the canopy. This isn\u2019t for the Trinity Forest either, where a management plan was created more than 10 years ago and sits unused. This is for the rest of the city, where the trees are vulnerable because of development and a lack of care.\n\n\u201cWe have a lot of great things going on internally here at the city, but we also have resources that exist like our reforestation fund, which hasn\u2019t been used as much as it should be,\u201d says James McGuire, the city\u2019s director of environmental quality and sustainability. \u201cWhat\u2019s lacking is something that will allow us to coordinate those efforts, measure year in, year out how many trees we\u2019re adding, whether we\u2019re taking care of our urban canopy or not, and something that would allow us to respond to events like the last few weekends.\u201d\n\nThe City Council was notified in a memo today that staff has engaged Texas Trees to create this management plan. The total cost is $230,000, with the city pitching in $50,000 from the reforestation fund that McGuire mentioned in the quote above. Texas Trees raised the rest itself. \u201cOnce developed, an UFMP will help make us a resilient, proactive, tree-smart city that recognizes a robust urban tree canopy as one of our primary tools in combating the urban heat island effect and climate change,\u201d the memo reads.\n\nThis is the final domino for the work Texas Trees has done over the last decade. In 2009, the nonprofit published its urban canopy study, which was the first time any organization bothered to look at what Dallas had. The Urban Dallas Forestry report broke down what that canopy is made up of, finding that 90 percent of what exists north of downtown was planted as single-family housing grew. (This is also when we put dollars to what the canopy was worth.) The organization also helped the city update its Article X ordinance, which was supposed to help guide how developers manage and plant trees. (The overhaul included such things as mandating developers not plant trees under power lines or near underground utilities that could be damaged by roots.)\n\nAfter that came the rather terrifying 2017 study of the city\u2019s urban heat island effect, finding that Dallas was heating up faster than all American cities but Phoenix and Louisville. The city had not considered its canopy holistically, and about 37 percent Dallas\u2019 land mass is covered in \u201cimpervious surfaces,\u201d which is jargon for concrete: roads, buildings, parking lots, garages, you name it. One way to fix that? Be smarter about what you\u2019re planting and where they\u2019re going. And then maintain them.\n\n\u201cHow do we take better care of the urban forest we have now and how do we grow it in a thoughtful and strategic way?\u201d asks Matt Grubisich, Texas Trees\u2019 director of operations. \u201cIt will be the roadmap that\u2014if the City Council chooses to adopt and puts resources to it\u2014shows how to move Dallas forward to maintain this asset.\u201d\n\nGrubisich anticipates the process to last about 10 months. The renowned naturalist consulting firm Davey Research Group will establish an advisory committee of stakeholders; he wants this to include everyone from Oncor and city staffers to the White Rock Lake-area hippie\u2014that\u2019s my word, not his\u2014tree lovers. Davey will research all the city codes and charters related to tree maintenance and planting. They\u2019ll interview each city department to figure out whether City Hall\u2019s organizational chart needs some reconfiguring. For example, Grubisich says there are numerous foresters in different departments, like Water Utilities, Community Development, and Public Works.\n\n\u201cYou guys are already spending a whole lot of money, so if you restructure this thing in a different way you may be able to do a lot of good with less money,\u201d he said.\n\nOne of the reasons all those trees were uprooted in recent weeks is because of poor maintenance, according to Janette Monear, Texas Trees\u2019 director. Many weren\u2019t pruned the right way or often enough. They\u2019re overwatered, causing the soil to saturate and the roots to migrate closer to the surface. When a bad storm comes, that\u2019s a formula for uprooting.\n\n\u201cStraight-line winds, if trees are pruned correctly and taken care of correctly, they hold up really well,\u201d Grubisich says. \u201cThey\u2019re shooting from the hip right now.\u201d\n\nThe major change will be buy-in from the city. As critics have noted, Texas Trees was the motivator in studying the city\u2019s urban canopy and how improved management and smarter planning can mitigate the effects of climate change, particularly in concrete-heavy neighborhoods like the Medical District. Grubisich said it was important to have the city as a partner in developing this plan, to ensure that the processes it establishes will actually be followed. That\u2019s why it was key for the city to pay for some of it. Cities that have had successful urban forest management plans\u2014Grubisich names Pittsburgh, Sacramento, and Palo Alto\u2014were born of a similar arrangement. The city is a partner, and vowed to adhere to its principles.\n\nPittsburgh will soon have a dedicated nursery to help the city replace what\u2019s been lost to development. The plan guides where those go. New York City was able to map out a plan to spend $385 million over 25 years on things like monitoring, reforestation, and management. McGuire sees this initiative as the first step in equitably distributing natural resources to underserved neighborhoods in South and southern Dallas. And once trees get planted, there will be a process for long-term maintenance.\n\n\u201cThere has been a lot of work done so we can drill into the areas of the city that are really suffering from the urban heat island effect,\u201d he said. \u201cIt does include that statement you made about planting the right tree in the right place, and I would agree that we haven\u2019t always gotten that right. A plan needs to address those things. But it needs to address these equity issues and this extreme heat issue so we\u2019re not just again throwing trees in response to an individual\u2019s demand, we\u2019re doing it in a way across the city that makes good policy.\u201d\n\nThe memo was paired with an announcement on the forthcoming Comprehensive Environmental & Climate Action Plan, which is how the city plans to improve its own energy footprint. If all goes according to plan, trees will finally be an important, intentional tool to help the city prepare to battle the ongoing effects of climate change.", "title": "The City of Dallas Is Finally Taking Its Tree Canopy Seriously", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Dallas']"}, {"id": 124, "city": "['Dallas', 'Houston']", "url": "https://www.texastribune.org/2019/07/02/why-homelessness-going-down-houston-dallas/", "text": "In the 1990s, Houston's urban core looked very different than it does today, with restaurants and coffee shops mingled among a burgeoning number of high-rise residences downtown. The city's bayous hadn't yet been beautified, with the clean biking and running trails that now wind through parks.\n\nBack then, the bayous were a refuge for the city's homeless residents. And downtown, a multitude of organizations served food or offered beds, often without a lot of coordination with one another.\n\nLatest in the Homeless in Texas series\n\n\u201cEverybody was walking down the streets of downtown to get to the soup kitchen or to the day shelter,\u201d Thao Costis, president and CEO of the homeless outreach organization Search, remembers. \u201cChurch groups would have clothing or a fast lunch for them. It was very reactionary to these basic needs.\u201d\n\nBut things have radically changed. While redevelopment has maybe made homelessness more visible to the urban core's new residents, the numbers show a 54% decrease in the Houston area's homeless population since 2011. This is according to the Point-in-Time count, a census that is done at the end of each January across the country, including in 11 urban areas of Texas. Although it is extremely difficult to count the homeless community in a precise way, experts agree that this process gives a good snapshot that allows people and governments to analyze general trends, and Houston\u2019s numbers look exceptionally low.\n\nIn the meantime, other Texas cities, like San Antonio, Fort Worth and Austin \u2014 which recently passed an ordinance that allows sitting and camping in public \u2014 are experiencing increases in the number of residents who don't have homes. And such an increase is especially dramatic in Dallas, which according the 2019 Point-in-Time count, saw its homeless population surpass Houston's.\n\nThese counts can vary each year depending on how meticulously they are conducted, and some cities have experienced increases once they\u2019ve perfected the methodology, like the Dallas area did in 2015. But no one denies that the rising number of homeless people is a growing problem in this city and its surrounding region.\n\n\u201cIf you look at our percentage of growth over the last three years [from 2015 to 2018], it is higher than most of the other cities in the country. It is really alarming,\u201d said Wayne Walker, executive director of the Dallas faith-based homeless organization Our Calling. \u201cIf you see our Point-in-Time count compared today to what we had last year, Dallas has more homeless people than any city in the southern U.S. except for Phoenix.\u201d\n\nLoading...\n\nSo how do the two most populated regions in the state tell such different stories?\n\n\u201cIt's very perplexing, to be honest, because you have leaderships in both communities that are very concerned with the issue,\u201d said Eric Samuels, president and CEO of the Texas Homeless Network. \u201cIn Houston, the former Mayor Annise Parker made it a priority to end homelessness. [Current Houston Mayor] Sylvester Turner has also made it a priority. But you can't say that [former] Mayor [Mike] Rawlings, in Dallas, did not make it a priority, because he did.\u201d\n\nIn Houston, the change in direction started in 2010.\n\nThe year before, while Dallas had counted 3,701 people on the street and in shelters, the number in Houston was 7,576. The Department of Housing and Urban Development then designated the Houston region as a priority community for assistance.\n\n\u201cHouston was notified by the HUD that we were not doing an adequate job on homelessness,\" said Mike Nichols, interim CEO of the Coalition for the Homeless of Houston/Harris County, the local continuum of care, a regional planning body that coordinates housing and services funding for homeless people. \u201cWe became a test site, with tremendous help from HUD.\u201d\n\nThings didn\u2019t improve right away. In 2011, Houston reached a peak of 8,538 people in the late January count. But the wheels were rolling. The organizations involved in the issue knew they needed to get the community united around the cause. They started a plan that first focused on military veterans, a group that represents roughly 9% of the national homeless population.\n\nOrganizers decided to challenge themselves to find housing for 100 veterans in 100 days.\n\nAt the time, it had been taking them around 220 days to find housing for a veteran. But they reached the goal of finding housing for 100 veterans in three months. The success gave them a credibility boost in the city.\n\n\u201cIt was an early win. We got it, and then we built around that,\u201d Costis said.\n\nIn three years, Houston would house 3,650 veterans, in what would become a model at the national level.\n\nThe change was achieved with a lot of coordination among Parker, HUD, police, businesses and about 100 organizations. Eva Thibaudeau-Graczyk, chief program officer of the Coalition for the Homeless, said the collaboration \u201cbrought new partners to the table with resources that had never been there before.\u201d\n\nAmong them was the Houston Housing Authority. \u201cPrior, they\u2019ve never seen themselves as a leader or a main partner in ending homelessness,\u201d Thibaudeau-Graczyk explained. But since then, this agency was key, allowing the city to complement the funds for homelessness provided by HUD with the resources that were already available for affordable housing.\n\n\u201cThis starts off with a simple dictate: The solution to homelessness is a home,\u201d said Andy Icken, chief development officer for Turner, the current mayor. \u201cOur focus was to create permanent supportive housing, so that we're not continually cycling people in and out of shelters, temporary or more permanent shelters.\u201d\n\nThe good results translated into more funds from HUD because part of that money was tied to performance. From 2008 to 2018, Houston added more than $18 million. To put that in perspective, in 2018, Dallas\u2019 total funds from HUD were $16.5 million.\n\nLoading...\n\nAlthough there are still challenges like encampments in different parts of the city, since 2012, Houston has housed around 17,000 formerly homeless people, according to the Coalition for the Homeless. Many are connected with supportive services.\n\n\u201cIf you have a homeless person and you put them in [permanent supportive housing] and simultaneously give them social, behavioral and health support services, 92% of them will be stable in that facility,\u201d Nichols said.\n\nBut there\u2019s a secret in Houston\u2019s formula: coordination.\n\nThe scenario from 20 years ago, when different organizations would serve food, give clothes or offer shelter \u2014 all done separately \u2014 has changed. There\u2019s now constant communication between these institutions and a digital database called the Homeless Management Information System, which allows people at several organizations to understand each case. Most cities today have HMIS in place, but Houston was quick to adopt it, and that helped organizations strategize, analyze, share information and find personalized solutions.\n\nAbout a decade ago, Percy Lyons arrived in Houston, hoping to live with his father.\n\n\u201cBut his mental state wasn\u2019t right,\" Lyons, now 44, said. \"He turned his back on me.\u201d\n\nLyons ended up living on the street. At some point, he applied for housing, but he never heard back from anyone until a police officer saw him and decided to check what had happened with his case, in collaboration with Search.\n\n\u201cThey pulled out my information and saw everything,\u201d Lyons said.\n\nThanks to this coordinated database, officials could find out what had happened \u2014 his case was \"lost in the system,\" he said \u2014 and try to find a solution for him.\n\nNow he lives in a permanent supportive housing unit.\n\n\u201cThe difference of what is going on in Houston is its networks,\u201d Lyons said.\n\nThe challenge of affordability in Dallas\n\nAlthough Carl Falconer has worked with homeless people for more than two decades, his first Point-in-Time count in Dallas was this January. In November, he moved to Texas from Florida to become CEO of the Metro Dallas Homeless Alliance, the local continuum of care, which brings together around 85 shelters and programs in Dallas and Collin counties.\n\n\u201cOne thing that stuck out there that night is that people in the streets did not have a sense of hope in the system,\" Falconer said. \u201cThey didn't have any confidence that they would be out of the streets any time soon.\"\n\nIt is difficult to separate this reality from the soaring Dallas real estate market, something that Houston is experiencing, but not to such intense degree. In the recently published Harvard report The State of the Nation\u2019s Housing, the Dallas metro area is mentioned as having the highest volume of home sales in 2018 ($9.2 billion, the same as Los Angeles). But home prices there grew 42% between 2006 and 2018. Only Austin, Denver and San Francisco topped Dallas in this indicator.\n\n\u201cOur homelessness numbers reflect the increase in housing costs across the Metroplex,\u201d said Daniel Roby, CEO of the Austin Street Center, one of the biggest shelters in the city.\n\nHe remembers coming to the center as a volunteer when he was 7 years old. At that time, suburban powerhouse Plano was practically grasslands. Now he says that he gets homeless people in the center from that city or other suburbs even farther out.\n\n\u201cOur Metroplex is massive compared to what it was then,\" he said. \"But we have not grown our social service infrastructure. For the most part, we have the same number of beds now that we had then. Maybe we\u2019ve added a few hundred beds, but our Metroplex has grown 10 times over.\u201d\n\nAccording to Monica Hardman, director of Dallas City Hall's Office of Homeless Solutions, around three quarters of homeless people are \u201ceconomically homeless,\u201d which means they fell into homelessness due to some kind of unforeseen problem, without a safety net. That includes situations like losing a job or having an unexpected health issue or an accident.\n\n\u201cWe have not grown our social service infrastructure. ... Maybe we\u2019ve added a few hundred beds, but our Metroplex has grown 10 times over.\u201d \u2014 Daniel Roby, CEO, Austin Street Center\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest factors is the housing conditions and the housing market here in Dallas. [It] is extremely hard to find housing that is affordable, especially if you are not making a living wage,\u201d Hardman said.\n\nFor people like Carlton Nalley, who lives near Dallas City Hall and spends most days in the Downtown Branch of the Dallas Public Library, this isn't just about housing.\n\n\u201cThe prices in general are going up,\u201d said Nalley, who has been homeless since 2017, when he was released from federal prison. \u201cBuying in the farmers market is like going to a shopping mall. You have to make three times the rent, and that will give you a small place in a neighborhood where you won't feel safe.\u201d\n\nAnd the rapid redevelopment in the city's urban core could exacerbate things, especially since it is arriving in areas that weren\u2019t as highly valued before and is replacing affordable units. Then there's another potential problem: expensive new residences' sudden proximity to existing shelters.\n\n\u201cRight behind us, probably within a matter of six months, there's going to be rents of $3,000 potentially for a one-bedroom unit,\u201d said Rebecca Cox, chief services officer at The Bridge, one of the leading providers of homeless services in the city. \u201cWe are concerned that we are going to be seen as undesirable.\u201d\n\nBut affordability isn\u2019t the only problem in Dallas. Institutions play a role here, too.\n\nRoby said Houston has some governmental advantages.\n\n\u201cThey have a strong mayoral form of government,\" he said. While in Houston, the executive power is in the hands of the mayor, in Dallas, the mayor plays a role similar to a board chairman, with a city manager directing most departments and employees. \"We [in Dallas] need to collaborate to get the support here, while there, the mayor can just move on with the mayor\u2019s agenda.\"\n\nAt the same time, Dallas has had issues in terms of affordable housing. In March of last year, The Dallas Morning News discovered a case of corruption in a $825,000 contract to build and repair affordable units. HUD has been conducting audits, and the city might have to pay millions back for mismanaged funds.\n\nMeanwhile, City Hall only got its first department dedicated to homelessness in 2017.\n\n\u201cFor example, if there was a homeless encampment in a park, the parks department would do their best to clean it up, and they would contact the police department if there was resistance, but there was no one really there as an advocate to be able to talk to the persons experiencing homelessness, and then to be able to link them to shelter and to services,\u201d said Hardman.\n\nAnd the Homeless Management Information System, a key part of Houston\u2019s success, has had hiccups in Dallas. It\u2019s going to be changed for a third time soon, and many in the community have resisted the previous versions.\n\n\u201cIt is exceptionally difficult to be able to have a high-functioning collaborative system when you change it so often,\u201d said Roby.\n\nBut nothing matters if Dallas doesn\u2019t build affordable housing, Falconer said. The unsheltered homeless population increased 725% from 2009 to 2019. The sheltered homeless population remains relatively stable because the number of beds at shelters has been the same for a long time.\n\n\u201cThe unsheltered number is going up because the shelters are full,\u201d Falconer said. \u201cPeople don't have anywhere to go; they can't go to the emergency shelters, and the reason why the emergency shelters numbers remain the same is because housing is not affordable and people can't move out of the shelter.\u201d\n\nDallas needs more housing, especially what is called rapid rehousing, which includes a bed, services and financial assistance for short periods. City officials, in the meantime, have put in place a program with four tracks: They are paying a shelter $12 per night per bed for up to 90-day stays; they have been working to create shelters for inclement weather; they got $1.3 million in the 2019 fiscal year budget for rental subsidies and other housing assistance; and they plan to build or create 1,000 housing units over the next three to five years. For the last item, the city will be dedicating $20 million in bond funds, and the request for developers' interest was just released.\n\nFalconer is hopeful.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that drew me to Dallas is that I really feel this is an opportunity to end homelessness here. Not manage it, not make it a little better \u2014 end it,\u201d he says. \u201cThe resources that we have here, the community we have here, the providers that we have here, even the programs that they've already set up, we have a really good structure in place.\u201d", "title": "Why homelessness is going down in Houston but up in Dallas", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Dallas', 'Houston']"}, {"id": 125, "city": "['Dallas']", "url": "https://www.dallasnews.com/news/weather/2019/08/26/dallas-green-cool-roofs-initiative-helps-city-turn-down-the-heat-on-urban-oven/", "text": "When it's scorching hot in downtown Dallas, it can be several degrees cooler in the suburbs and relatively pleasant in rural areas.\n\nBlame it on Dallas' urban heat island effect: heat produced by densely concentrated people, vehicles and energy use.\n\nAnd when the city's hot, you can bet the roofs are on fire. That's why \"cool roofs\" are among the initiatives the city of Dallas has implemented to reduce the urban heat island effect.\n\nCool roofs are designed to reflect, rather than absorb, the heat and can even help cool the inside of a building, according to the U.S. Green Building Council. Since 2013, the city requires all new construction in Dallas to have cool roofs as part of the Green Building Ordinance.\n\nThese measures aren't just green but they're also cost-effective.\n\n\"They have the potential to reduce emissions in one of our biggest sectors \u2014 buildings and energy \u2014 in a way that cuts energy costs to the consumer,\" said James McGuire, director of the Dallas Office of Environmental Quality and Sustainability.\n\nNew buildings in Dallas must: use roofing materials that reflect solar heat on at least 75% of the roof's surface; have a vegetated roof that covers at least 50% of the area; or use a combination of the two, according to requirements by the Green Building Council.\n\nA 2014 study found that in metropolitan areas cool roofs could help temperatures drop by about 3 degrees.\n\n1/4Aerial view of roof of the Perot Museum of Nature and Science photographed on Wednesday, Aug. 21, 2019, in Dallas.

LEED is a rating system that certifies buildings with green features that are energy and resource efficient and good for the environment.\n\nThe Perot Museum of Nature and Science, which has LEED gold status, boasts a \u201cliving roof\u201d that \u2014 in addition to mitigating the urban heat island effect \u2014 is designed to catch rainwater and condensation from the building\u2019s mechanical equipment, according to Mike Spiewak, the museum\u2019s vice president of exhibitions.\n\n\u201cThe mission of the Perot Museum is to inspire minds through nature and science,\u201d Spiewak said. \u201cThe museum\u2019s \u2018living roof\u2019 is more than just a visually interesting shelter, it also serves as an educational illustration of the diverse biomes of Texas, from the deserts of West Texas to the prairies of Central Texas.\u201d\n\nThe museum's roof filters water into cisterns that hold 50,000 gallons used to irrigate the grounds and to serve other nonpotable water needs such as toilet flushing, Spiewak said.\n\nA small waterfall of rain flows off the end of a collection system at the Perot Museum of Nature and Science on Wednesday , January 9, 2013 in Dallas.

McCarthy / Staff Photographer)\n\nThe Trinity River Audubon Center in southeast Dallas also boasts several green features, including a vegetated roof on its administrative wing, water-efficient landscaping, paving to control stormwater and other efforts that gave it a LEED certification.\n\nOther buildings, like Victory Block G at 2370 Victory Ave. and AMLI Fountain Place at 1800 Field St., are taking LEED-based approaches without the official certification.\n\nGoing beyond\n\nWhile Dallas requires all new construction to have cool roofs, New York City took it a step further by providing existing buildings with cool roofs through a program called NYC CoolRoofs.\n\nThe initiative installs cool roofs for free or at a low cost to nonprofits, community or recreational centers, schools, hospitals, museums, cultural centers, and co-op housing. Since 2009, more than 5 million square feet of rooftops have been coated throughout the city, according to New York's office of sustainability.\n\nOther cities are going beyond roofs to cool things down. Los Angeles, for example, in 2017 began painting black roads white with a cool pavement treatment. The treatment can keep things 10 degrees cooler on a summer afternoon, according to the Los Angeles Department of Public Works.\n\nThe cooler roads are costly, however, with a price tag of $40,000 per mile, according to Business Insider.\n\nIn Mexico City, hundreds of highway pillars are being turned into vertical gardens through a project called Via Verde. The project aims to help regulate temperature, reduce air pollution, lessen noise and even decrease stress for residents of the Mexican capital.\n\nOther cooling methods\n\nCooling off man-made structures isn't enough to mitigate the urban heat island effect in Dallas. Planting more trees is also part of the city\u2019s strategy.\n\nA study on urban heat island management by the Texas Tree Foundation proposed Dallas plant 250,000 trees to help reduce the heat island effect.\n\nDallas has begun to chip away at that figure through \"Branch Out Dallas,\" a city-funded program aimed at cooling the city by giving residents free trees. In the spring the city gave away more than 2,600 trees, and a similar event is planned in the fall.\n\nDallas is also in the middle of developing its first climate action plan, which will be unveiled in spring 2020. The plan is expected to tackle several environmental issues including water and wastewater, buildings and energy, food and urban agriculture, and climate resilience.", "title": "Dallas' green 'cool roofs' initiative helps city turn down the heat on urban oven", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Dallas']"}, {"id": 126, "city": "['Dallas']", "url": "https://www.nurserymag.com/article/dallas-creates-first-ever-urban-forest-plan/", "text": "Developed by the teams behind Cannabis Business Times, Cannabis Dispensary and Cannabis Conference, Hemp Grower will launch as a weekly newsletter and website; print magazine to launch in late 2019.\n\nCleveland, OH \u2013 Aug. 14, 2019 \u2013 GIE Media Inc. announced today the launch of its 18th title, Hemp Grower, which will serve the newly legal U.S. hemp industry and emerging hemp markets in North America.

Through eye-opening data and pointed solutions, Cullum Clark argues that Dallas can become a national leader in reviving upward mobility in his essay, \"Gentrification in Dallas\".\n\nClark's essay is part of a new report by the Center for Opportunity Urbanism, Beyond Gentrification: Towards More Equitable Growth which explores how unbalanced urban growth has exacerbated class divisions, particularly in the urban centers of our largest's metropolitan areas.\n\nRead an excerpt of Clark's piece below.\n\nThe Dallas region is a microcosm of America\u2019s latest urban evolution. The Dallas-Fort Worth metro area is booming, fueled by a range of thriving industries and a tremendous influx of people and businesses. The city of Dallas \u2014 home to 1.3 million of the 7.4 million in the DFW metro \u2014 has experienced a stunning resurgence from the dark days of the 1980s oil and real estate crash.\n\nYet for all its heady growth, Dallas still faces many of the defining challenges bedeviling other major cities and the nation as a whole: a dwindling middle class, growing bifurcation into \u201chave\u201d and \u201chave-not\u201d neighborhoods, an emerging home affordability problem, and rising numbers of poor citizens for whom twenty-first century prosperity seems a sham. In certain respects, the city\u2019s revival has compounded these challenges.\n\nDallas remains among the most economically and racially segregated cities in America, in part reflecting the heritage of Jim Crow. The poverty rate in the city of Dallas is nearly 23%, one of the highest among large American cities. At the same time, Dallas has a greater opportunity to address these challenges than most of its peers, in view of the DFW area\u2019s economic vibrancy and the city\u2019s comparatively abundant and inexpensive land. Unlike most big cities, Dallas has the potential to build its way out of its current challenges.\n\nDallas urgently needs to pursue three policy directions in order to shift to a more inclusive and sustainable pattern of urban growth. First, it needs to spark a new home building boom focused on middle and lower-income families, especially in depressed southern Dallas. Second, it should adopt a range of smart policies to preserve and rehabilitate as much of the existing housing and commercial real estate stock as possible in less advantaged areas. And third, it needs to get considerably more creative about bringing urban amenities \u2014 innovative schools, stores, restaurants, health clinics, greenspace and arts facilities, and the middle-skilled jobs that come with them \u2014 to historically underserved areas. If it gets these things right, Dallas can become a national leader in reviving upward mobility and the promise of the middleclass American Dream.\n\nRead the full report here (PDF).\n\nCullum Clark is Director of the George W.

We\u2019re hoping this plan can help get us there,\u201d Alvarez said. The plan \"becomes a more holistic look at what our tree canopy is.\u201d\n\nThe Texas Trees Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting and enhancing urban forests in the state, raised $230,000 for the plan, which will be matched by $50,000 from the city, according to a memo presented to the City Council last week.\n\n\u201cThis is a big step. It is the culmination of a lot of work by a lot of different people,\u201d said Matt Grubisich, director of operations and urban forestry for the foundation. \u201cWhen I first moved to Dallas 19 years ago, trying to talk trees at the horseshoe [the council] didn't get very far. It was development first.\u201d\n\nIn addition to keeping the city cooler during the summer, protecting the city\u2019s trees would also save Dallas money.\n\nA 2015 study by the Texas Trees Foundation found that the city's trees \u2014 14.7 million of them \u2014 save the city more than $9 million annually through energy conservation and an additional $4 million in repairs to stormwater management infrastructure by collecting 59 million cubic feet of runoff.\n\nThe study also could provide insight on where the city needs more trees. It found that 37% of the city\u2019s total tree canopy \u2014 the layer of trees that cover the ground when seen from above \u2014 is south of Interstate 30.\n\nDavey Research Group, a naturalist consulting firm, will be tasked with developing the plan, which will take about 10 months, Grubisich said. The firm will form an advisory group \u2014 made up of tree experts from outside the city, city department heads, neighborhood organizations, and companies such as Oncor \u2014 to get insights on what the plan should include.\n\n\u201cYou have different people touching trees, but you need to have a goal and a vision,\u201d Grubisich said. \u201cA master plan sets the vision and goals for the city\u2019s urban forest.\u201d\n\nThe master plan will provide a framework, and then the city can begin to decide where it will plant more trees, how many and other details, Grubisich said.\n\nIn what Alvarez called an \u201cincredibly good parallel effort,\u201d the city hopes to roll out the plan next year around the time the Dallas climate action plan is launched. That's scheduled for April.\n\nBefore then, the city plans to give out about 2,500 trees to Dallas homeowners on Nov. 2, Texas Arbor Day. Dallas hosted a similar event in the spring, when it gave out over 2,600 trees through Branch Out Dallas, a city-funded program aimed at reducing the heat island effect and improving air quality.\n\nThe trees handed out in November will be Texas natives \u201cthat will do well here,\u201d Alvarez said.\n\nGrubisich said he's hopeful that by fall 2020, Dallas could begin to see large-scale tree-planting efforts.", "title": "More trees can help Dallas keep its cool, now that forestry plan has a green light", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Dallas']"}, {"id": 129, "city": "['Dallas']", "url": "https://www.dallasnews.com/business/technology/2019/05/16/dallas-could-land-major-uber-expansion-thousands-of-jobs/", "text": "Dallas is a leading contender for a major expansion by ride-hailing giant Uber that would transform the city into one of the tech company\u2019s largest hubs outside San Francisco, company officials confirmed Thursday.\n\nUber has zeroed in on a site in Deep Ellum for an office that would employ several thousand workers, from engineers and finance executives to salespeople. Jobs would span Uber\u2019s businesses, from delivering food to developing a new urban air taxi service.\n\nUber plans to make a decision by late August, after narrowing its list to fewer than a handful of cities, said spokesman Travis Considine. He declined to identify the other cities being considered.\n\nIf Uber chooses Dallas, it\u2019s planning to move into the Epic, an 8-acre development on the eastern edge of downtown Dallas in Deep Ellum, Considine said. It is at Elm Street and Good-Latimer Expressway.\n\nThe San Francisco-based company\u2019s expansion would be a big win for the city of Dallas. The city has seen major development after major development \u2014 including Fortune 500 headquarters \u2014 pick the suburbs over the city. Toyota North America opened its new headquarters in Plano. Pharmaceutical giant McKesson\u2019s headquarters moved from San Francisco to Irving. And Texas Instruments recently announced it\u2019s going to build a $3.1 billion manufacturing facility in Richardson.\n\nDallas was reported to be a frontrunner for Amazon\u2019s second headquarters, but it ultimately missed out. Amazon split the project, dubbed HQ2, between New York City and Washington D.C. area. Amazon later backed out of the New York expansion plans.\n\nWith Uber, Dallas gets a chance to prove it not only can lure big fish \u2014 but also reel them in.\n\nDallas Mayor Mike Rawlings said Uber's interest in Dallas \"is consistent with how our marketplace and how our city is being viewed by corporations across America.\"\n\n\"They see us as a place where they can do business, have a great place to work and have a great deal of tech talent,\" he said. But he added, \"It's not over. We have to keep doing everything we have to do to convince them to come.\"\n\nUber declined to say if it's seeking tax incentives from the state, county or city. The city approved a $2 million tax break over the next decade for developers of the Epic project. Dallas County approved a 10-year tax abatement, worth an estimated $550,000 in tax savings, for developers to convert a historic building into a hotel.\n\nWith Uber, Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said he sees tax incentives as \"the last steps in the marathon.\"\n\n\"It's a great project, and it's the sort of jobs that we need to draw to Dallas to really increase our average wage and provide good opportunities for people in our urban core,\" he said. \"We are excited to be a part of hopefully a successful effort to bring them here and if they come here, I'll make sure to increase my use of Uber and encourage everyone else to.\"\n\nThe property that Uber is eyeing is a joint effort between landowner Westdale Real Estate Investment and Management and office developer KDC. It includes an office tower, apartment high-rise and restored historic building that's becoming a luxury hotel. It has room for two more towers.\n\nDeveloper KDC, which built the office tower at the Epic, would not comment.\n\nReal estate brokers and developers tracking the deal said Uber has told them it will need the office space starting before the end of the year. The just-finished Epic office building would be able to immediately accommodate a first phase of Uber's employment.\n\nDallas is a major market for Uber. It was the first Texas city to get Uber's ride-hailing service in September 2012. Since then, Uber has added food delivery service, Uber Eats, and chosen Dallas as the testing ground for its urban air taxi service, Uber Air, that it plans to demonstrate in 2020. In March, Uber signed an up to $1.5 million contract with Dallas Area Rapid Transit to provide free and discounted rides to help connect people to nearby light-rail and bus stations. It also has bike-share and scooter-share in Dallas through Jump, which it owns.\n\nUber\u2019s plans for a large new corporate hub come soon after its debut on the New York Stock Exchange in early May. Its rival, Lyft, began trading on the public markets in late March.\n\nUber is building a new 1.1 million-square-foot headquarters in San Francisco that's expected to open in 2020, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nUber is planning to expand in other cities. The company's second largest hub now is Chicago, which has over 1,000 employees. Uber is in discussions about leasing a 450,000-square-foot office in a building being redeveloped along the Chicago River, according to The Chicago Tribune. If it follows through on the deal, the lease would be one of the largest ever signed by a technology company in Chicago, the Tribune said.\n\nIt's reportedly looking for more office space in New York City, too. It is visiting sites with between 250,000 and 350,000 square feet around Bryant Park in Midtown and 3 World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan, according to a late April report by Crain's New York.\n\nUber also has a large presence in Washington, D.C., and its Advanced Technologies Group \u2014 which focuses on autonomous vehicle development \u2014 is based in Pittsburgh, near Carnegie Mellon University.\n\nBut Dallas is competing for an office that would be equal in headcount \u2014 or potentially bigger \u2014 than Chicago, according to Uber\u2019s Considine.\n\nRawlings said Dallas is attracting major tech companies' attention because their employees want quality of life amenities, such as new parks that are underway in downtown.\n\n\"Whether you want to eat at a Thai restaurant or play with your dog in the park or go to a good show, every year we get better and better at this stuff,\" he said.\n\nUber has about 140 employees in Texas. Its largest office in the state is in downtown Austin, where it has about 90 employees who work in sales, recruiting, operations, marketing and public policy. It has about a dozen employees in a small office in Dallas' West End. The company's careers site lists eight jobs ranging from finance and accounting to software engineers and a global employment tax manager.\n\nThe company has nearly 11,000 employees in the U.S., according to a registration statement it filed with the SEC ahead of its initial public offering. In the April filing, the company said it planned to increase its headcount significantly to keep up with expansion across the globe.\n\nStaff writer Steve Brown contributed to this report.", "title": "Dallas could land major Uber expansion, thousands of jobs", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Dallas']"}, {"id": 130, "city": "['Dallas']", "url": "https://www.govtech.com/fs/infrastructure/Dallas-Transit-Chief-Calls-for-Federal-Infrastructure-Funding.html", "text": "(TNS) \u2014 Dallas Area Rapid Transit president Gary Thomas on Monday urged Congress to deliver a far-reaching infrastructure bill, joining other public transit leaders in stressing the importance of funding billions of dollars in improvements.\n\nSpeaking at news conference hosted by the American Public Transportation Association, Thomas said it was \"imperative\" to \"supply the needs of the American people.\"\n\nHe offered up a few upcoming DART projects to make his case: the Cotton Belt commuter rail line; platform extensions on the Red and Blue lines; rail replacement in downtown Dallas; and \"D2,\" the long-awaited second rail alignment through the city center.\n\n\"As we look at the fourth-largest metropolitan area in the country and one of the fastest growing areas in the country, we're constantly looking at how we continue to address the congestion issues,\" he said.\n\nThis is not the first time Thomas and other transit leaders have pressed lawmakers for action.\n\nThe notion of an expansive infrastructure bill is a perennial favorite in Washington. Both Republicans and Democrats from all over the U.S. tend to like the idea, which would address the widely documented problem of America's overstressed roads, bridges and railways.\n\nBut Congress has yet to act on the matter since President Donald Trump took office, in part because there is deep disagreement on how to pay for it all.\n\nTransit leaders on Monday nevertheless expressed optimism that there was a legit chance \u2014 for real, this time \u2014 to soon pass an infrastructure package, with Thomas singling out Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-Dallas, and Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, for praise on the issue.\n\n\"We'll continue to work with the entire delegation, but those are the folks we're going to look to for leadership,\" he said.\n\nMuch of the attention around a potential infrastructure bill gets tied to highways and other car-centric projects. The American Public Transportation Association is hoping to change that dynamic.\n\nThe group is seeking put to put a brighter spotlight on the public transportation element of such legislation by identifying more than $230 billion in mass transit projects that could benefit from an infrastructure bill. A big chunk of those projects would address a backlog of needed repairs.\n\nThe list might be somewhat overstated, since it includes, for instance, a couple of DART projects already moving forward.\n\nBut Thomas said the D2 project, with its targeted opening date of 2024, is a $1.4 billion endeavor that could really benefit from a robust infrastructure package. He also said he'd like to see any future legislation \"include a much heavier emphasis on technology.\"\n\nThe DART chief noted the success his agency has had with its GoPass app, which is a planning and ticketing tool.\n\nHe said that \"transit agencies, public agencies of any kind, are risk averse \u2014 none us want to get out there and get slapped around because it didn't work.\" Incentives could encourage more agencies to be more aggressive in trying out new technology and approaches, he said.\n\n\u00a92019 The Dallas Morning News.

Laden with paint, buckets of chalk and doughnuts \u2014 and while dodging the occasional car \u2014 activists began laying down the artwork they want to inspire passersby to feel both empowered and part of the larger social justice movement that\u2019s swept the Bay Area this summer.\n\n\u201cI hope that they appreciate the art and the beauty of it, but that it makes them think \u2014 it makes them think about their neighbors and the messages contained in it,\u201d said Shaunn Cartwright, a homelessness advocate and organizer. \u201cAnd I hope they feel represented, whether they\u2019re housed or unhoused.\u201d\n\nCartwright and several other local activists drew inspiration from the Black Lives Matter mural that activists painted near Backesto Park on July 4th. Working with local tattoo artist Benny Arana O\u2019Hara as the chief designer, the team voted on the 14 phrases that best encompassed their intersecting messages.\n\nThe finished product \u2014 emblazoned with sun-orange, lavender and turquoise \u2014 shows two fists pounding, with their thumbs almost touching in the middle, as a collection of Spanish and English words like \u201cresilient,\u201d \u201corgullo\u201d (pride) and \u201cmental health\u201d dance around them.

Last month she was one of 16 artists chosen to paint a block letter in the Black Lives Matter mural along Palo Alto\u2019s Hamilton Avenue.\n\nFor Brown, the mural shows the inextricable connection between homelessness and racism. A whopping 20% of San Jos\u00e9 homeless residents are Black as compared to just 3% of the population, while Latinx people make up another 41% as compared to 32% of the population, according to the 2019 city homelessness census. And it\u2019s personal, too: Her father was a homeless student at San Jos\u00e9 State before her.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very interconnected to me \u2014 most of the people who are homeless are BIPOCs,\u201d Brown said, meaning Black, Indigenous and people of color. \u201cWe had all that time during the pandemic to think. We stayed home, we were reflecting. We were doing all this shadow work with ourselves and our communities so that when this movement started, it started something new, because we didn\u2019t have distractions.\u201d\n\nAs a growing team of about 50 people began painting over the chalk outline, bobbing their heads to \u201cFunky Town\u201d and \u201cThat\u2019s The Way (I Like It),\u201d volunteers set up a T-shirt tent and prepped for a hand sanitizer and food drive. Soon local politicians like Supervisor Dave Cortese and California State Assemblymember Ash Kalra took the mic.\n\n\u201cIn San Jos\u00e9, we see the most egregious examples of income inequality. You see the tale of two valleys, with the working class that\u2019s being crushed under the weight of this enormous amount of wealth \u2014 because the wealth in no ways comes into the communities that not only need it the most, but helped to create that wealth,\u201d Kalra told the crowd.\n\nRelated Articles Unemployed Bay Area workers find new calling, new paychecks\n\nHomeless youth treated to free shopping spree in Emeryville mall\n\nLawsuit: CHP targets men parked after dark at I-280 rest stops\n\nA new solution to hunger?

The changes could come as early as November.\n\nTrain operators have long been required, under federal law, to sound their horns at crossings to warn nearby motorists and pedestrians to stay away from the tracks \u2014 unless a city like San Jose can meet certain requirements, such as warning signs and bells at crossings, and establish a \u201cquiet zone.\u201d A study completed earlier this month confirmed that San Jose meets the requirements to move forward with its plan after issuing notices to specific stakeholders such as Union Pacific.\n\n\u201cOver the last (year and a half) our residents have suffered greatly from sleep deprivation, and the establishment of this partial quiet zone will finally restore the quality of life for residents along the Union Pacific Railroad corridor,\u201d Councilmember Raul Peralez, who represents the city\u2019s downtown core, said in a letter to his constituents.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until February 2019 that the jarring train signals became unbearable for many downtown San Jose residents.\n\nThat\u2019s when Union Pacific significantly increased the number of trains passing through San Jose every day and began running trains at night as part of a plan to reduce idling locomotives. Union Pacific now operates an average of six trains per day \u2014 three trains during the day and three trains between 8 p.m. and the early hours of the morning.\n\nJason Muehring, who lives about a block away from the tracks in the Hensley neighborhood and has been working with the city closely to find a resolution to the disruption, called the city\u2019s plan for quiet zones \u201ca great accomplishment.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m thrilled that later this calendar year, my family and my neighbors will finally be able to sleep through the night without being woken up by train horns,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Muehring isn\u2019t fully satisfied just yet.\n\nHe wants to see the city expand it to a 24-hour quiet zone, so that not only could neighboring residents enjoy better sleep at night but Japantown businesses and visitors could also experience fewer interruptions during the daytime.\n\nTo require trains to silence their horns at all hours, however, is a much more cumbersome and costly task that requires constructing new safety measures and infrastructure at railroad crossings. Those safety upgrades \u2014 such as improving signals and installing pedestrian gates \u2014 at all 14 crossings along the corridor would cost between $19 million and $32 million, according to a study completed for the city earlier this month.\n\n\u201cOur next priority is to see what we can do as a community to secure funding,\u201d Muehring said. \u201cThen we can put this nightmare behind us.\u201d\n\nAccording to a statement on its website, Union Pacific believes quiet zones \u201ccompromise the safety of railroad employees, customers, and the general public.\u201d But Union Pacific spokesperson Tim McMahan said the company is \u201cencouraged by the City of San Jose\u2019s commitment to study a quiet zone in the area and will continue to work in partnership with city representatives on this solution.\u201d\n\nWhile the overnight quiet zone is expected to substantially cut down on the use of horns, train operators will still be required by federal law to sound their horns when they see hazards such as pedestrians walking along or across the railroad corridor.\n\nLast summer, the city considered suing Union Pacific, claiming that the nighttime freight trains \u2014 and their failure to keep the track corridor free from blight and trash \u2014 posed a nuisance. A memo from Mayor Sam Liccardo in May of 2019 said the company \u201cchose to burden our downtown residents with nighttime operations to improve their own profits.\u201d\n\nAlthough the city inevitably opted not to pursue litigation, Union Pacific proactively began to resolve at least one of the city\u2019s main qualms late last year. The railroad operator in December launched an extensive, citywide cleanup and abatement effort along its San Jose tracks \u2014 the first of its kind in recent years.\n\nWithout jurisdiction over Union Pacific\u2019s right-of-way, the hands of city officials historically have been tied to address resident complaints of blight and trash as homeless encampments and illegal dumping along the tracks have become more prevalent.\n\nIn December, San Jose seemed on the verge of an agreement with Union Pacific that would require the company to clean up its right of way roughly once a month and allow the city to enter the tracks for law enforcement calls and homeless outreach.\n\nBut nearly eight months later, the city and Union Pacific have yet to finalize the agreement.\n\n\u201cThat document has been frustratingly sitting with the lawyers for Union Pacific since March 16,\u201d City Attorney Richard Doyle said. \u201cWe haven\u2019t gotten any comment back.\u201d", "title": "San Jose to create a \u2018quiet zone\u2019 to stop trains from blaring horns at night", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['San Jose']"}, {"id": 135, "city": "['San Jose']", "url": "https://sanjosespotlight.com/plan-to-turn-old-san-jose-hospital-into-urban-village-criticized/", "text": "A plan to revitalize a sleepy roadway is getting pushback from residents.\n\nSanta Clara County\u2019s newest project aimed at creating a livelier neighborhood is underway, after lawmakers on Tuesday approved a mixed-use urban village at the former San Jose Medical Center site, but the plan is being sharply criticized for lacking retail or sustainability concepts.\n\nThe 12-acre slot project \u2014 the East Santa Clara Master Plan \u2014 offers space for office and retail use with 550 to 800 units of housing, located at 14th and Santa Clara streets in downtown San Jose. According to a county report, the goal is to create a pedestrian friendly, affordable and mixed housing space.\n\nCounty officials reported that \u201cthe scale of the development will contribute to the density of activity that makes a city energetic and attractive\u201d and that an \u201cactive and vibrant\u201d public space relies on an \u201cappropriate mix of amenities.\u201d\n\n\u201cWith very little exception, this downtown neighborhood has not been NIMBY at all.

Christensen wants to see the entire first floor of both office buildings filled with retail shops, an effort to create a vibrant corridor. The two office buildings are expected to rise five to six stories.\n\nCatalyze SV, a nonprofit focused on smart development, agreed that the project\u2019s proposed retail quantity is \u201cwoefully inadequate.\u201d\n\nThe group\u2019s leaders said in a letter that the plan should also provide an alternative to car-centric culture by creating more walkable and bike-friendly pathways and incorporating gardens, taller buildings to improve housing density and sustainability approaches centered around minimizing a carbon footprint.\n\nSome residents say the plan does not consider the historical preservation of the old hospital site, and instead aims to demolish it.\n\n\u201cWe want you to respect the structure and its place in our neighborhood,\u201d said county resident April Halberstadt. \u201cThe plan that\u2019s coming before us does not reflect the concerns, needs and desires of the neighborhood and fails to understand our overall history. So far \u2014 we know we\u2019re just in the planning stages \u2014 but we\u2019d like to see the building identified as important.\u201d\n\nChavez agreed with those concerns and proposed some key amendments to expand the \u201cretail footprint\u201d of the area. She also suggested exploring the preservation of the historic hospital buildings, creating taller buildings for more housing units beyond the 800 unit mark and eliminate the need for a parking structure. She added that a taller building limit is \u201cthe only way retail is going to come alive on that street.\u201d\n\nThe supervisor called for a retail study with the city of San Jose to address some of those concerns.\n\n\u201cI know we\u2019ve gotten a lot of feedback and input,\u201d added Chavez. \u201cThe neighborhood has to have lots of different housing types \u2014 it\u2019s a very mixed neighborhood already and that\u2019s what makes it so interesting and beautiful.

So cities such as San Jose say they need to address the region\u2019s growing housing crisis by investing in building denser housing \u2014 fast \u2014 and doing away with the sprawl of single-family homes.\n\nIn San Jose, 94 percent of the city is zoned for single-family homes, differing significantly from other California cities such as San Francisco, which is at 37 percent and Los Angeles at 75 percent.\n\nSan Jose is focusing on executing its general four year review plan, dubbed by city officials as the city\u2019s preamble to SB50, a statewide bill that was shelved earlier this year aimed at streamlining housing production around transit corridors.\n\nWhile the plan is focused on creating denser housing in urban corridors \u2014 there\u2019s a catch.\n\n\u201cThere has been this concern about the impact of the redevelopment of the single-family character,\u201d said Michael Brilliot, deputy director of the city\u2019s planning department.\n\nAccording to Brillot, San Jose is \u201cpretty much built out,\u201d and has been done building single-family homes for more than 15 years \u2014 unlike other cities in the country.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have a lot of vacant land left. But we need to densify,\u201d added Brillot. \u201cWe need to transform the suburban city into a more urban place. So the bargain was, we\u2019re going to develop high-density housing around our urban corridors but in exchange for that we\u2019re going to add policies that further preserve our existing single-family homes.\u201d\n\nThat means the city will not allow a developer to go into a residential neighborhood, buy four or five different properties and knock them down to build taller developments in that same neighborhood. Instead, San Jose aims to allow dense developments only in certain corridors, particularly around commercial streets and transportation.\n\nSan Jose officials are not looking to ban single-family zoning altogether as other major cities, such as Minneapolis, Seattle and for the first time the entire state of Oregon, are attempting to do.\n\nMinneapolis effectively ended single-family zoning by opening up all residential neighborhoods to multi-unit housing, while in Seattle, sweeping changes upzoned 27 residential neighborhoods, allowing for taller and denser buildings. In both cases, developers can build multi-unit residences in neighborhoods that were previously only designated for single-family homes.\n\nOther cities in the Bay Area are looking to follow in these footsteps, as San Francisco said it\u2019s exploring rezoning in single-family neighborhoods and Oakland\u2019s Mayor Libby Schaaf has endorsed the idea.\n\nWhile San Jose officials recognize the trend, many still say it\u2019s not the right solution for the region. Instead, Mayor Sam Liccardo supports banning single-family developments near commercial corridors and transportation hubs \u2014 not citywide.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s face it \u2014 most of the Bay Area is still suburban,\u201d Liccardo said in a panel to other local mayors last week. \u201cYou got lots of family housing and you\u2019re not going to bulldoze it to go build apartments, at least not if you don\u2019t want them to burn down City Hall.\u201d\n\nAlthough Liccardo supports protecting the character of existing suburban neighborhoods, he isn\u2019t opposed to up zoning in certain neighborhoods where it makes sense. Allowing the construction of \u201cmedium-density\u201d buildings such as duplexes, triplexes or fourplexes in between urban villages and residential spaces can provide \u201ca more gradual transition,\u201d he said.\n\nIn most American cities, preserving the suburban ideal is vital, as 75 percent of them prohibit building anything other than a single family home in residential spaces. Most of San Jose\u2019s zoning is single-family, so if rezoning isn\u2019t an option right now, city officials are turning to other solutions to build.\n\nFor neighborhoods where single-family homes are inevitable, the mayor proposed a program that incentivizes homeowners to build secondary granny units and rent them out to low-income families. In exchange, homeowners will get forgivable loans and some of the costs covered by the city .\n\n\u201cSo you\u2019re dealing with a lot of single family housing \u2014 we got to figure out ways to get the housing on those parcels,\u201d added Liccardo.\n\nWhile the mayor hopes this idea catches on, some experts say outreach efforts are essential in promoting any new kind of housing proposal \u2014 especially those that challenge single-family housing.\n\n\u201cFor this to even occur in San Jose, it will require an immense amount of true community engagement,\u201d said Michelle Huttenhoff, San Jose\u2019s policy director for SPUR. \u201cI think people resist change because they\u2019re concerned, they\u2019re fearful. The unknown is just concerning. It is more important than ever to have a strong civic engagement communication, strategy, and policy from a city level.\u201d\n\nAccording to Huttenhoff, SPUR is advocating that the city create a team solely focused on community engagement that will go beyond the minimal requirement to inform residents about potential developments in a neighborhood.\n\nBut not all residents agree that this would do much. Many don\u2019t see how building more high-density housing in their neighborhoods could solve the region\u2019s crisis. Some residents are worried that new developments can \u201cskyrocket\u201d prices, change the \u201csmall neighborhood\u201d feel and stretch limited community resources.\n\n\u201cHow are you going to justify all of this high-density housing bringing more people into the city to sleep, but not work?\u201d said Elizabeth Estensen, president of the Willow Glen Neighborhood Association. \u201cThat hurts the entire city because it puts more pressure on roads, on travel. Our sewer system, our water \u2014 all of that is going to be impacted.\u201d\n\nBut despite what city officials say, Estensen said she sees \u201cseveral, several complexes\u201d being built in otherwise single-family home neighborhoods like Willow Glen.\n\nStill, Estensen said that granny units are a solution that residents \u201cwould respond well to.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m born and raised here, my children are sixth generation Willow Glen, and granny units have always been something that people have rented out,\u201d said Estensen. \u201d I think it\u2019s positive.\u201d\n\nContact Nadia Lopez at [email protected] or follow @n_llopez on Twitter.", "title": "Is banning single-family zoning possible in San Jose?", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['San Jose']"}, {"id": 139, "city": "['San Jose']", "url": "https://www.archpaper.com/2019/09/google-san-jose-transit-village/", "text": "In a San Jose, California, community meeting on August 22, Google revealed its plans for the San Jose Transit Village. The mile-long village along the former industrial area west of Highway 87 is anticipated to house 5.5 million square feet of office space for the tech company, 3,000 to 5,000 housing units, a combined 500,000 square feet of space for retail, culture, and education, and 15 acres of green spaces. The proposed plan holds the potential to provide employment for 20,000 to 25,000 people.\n\nThe project\u2019s goal is to create an urban hub centered around people rather than cars, with paths connecting various plazas and green spaces in Google\u2019s (and planners SITELAB Urban Studio\u2019s) Framework Plan. At the heart of the village is the extant Diridon Station, which has become one of the largest transit hubs on the west coast. The station not only services San Jose but also functions as a transit hub for Santa Clara County and Silicon Valley. As part of the San Jose Diridon Station Area Plan, the stop is planned to incorporate a VTA light rail and BART extension to the available services.\n\nGoogle and Trammell Crow, a Texan private commercial real-estate developer and investor, have spent over a year acquiring privately owned land in the area. Last November, Google negotiated the sale of 10.5 acres of publicly owned property around Diridon Station for $109.87 million. Google\u2019s proposal offers a complete transformation of the area and an exchange of the traditional closed-off corporate tech campus design for an open concept plan that welcomes the community.\n\nAlexa Arena, Google\u2019s director of real estate development, insisted that both Google workers and San Jose residents want to emerge from the station directly into a vibrant city. San Jose\u2019s director of economic development, Kim Walesh, agreed with Arena\u2019s sentiments, and told Mercury News, \u201cThey have designed a district that meets their office needs but that is going to feel like an extension of the downtown\u2026and like a very high-quality, regular urban area, I think that must be a first.\u201d\n\nThe Framework Plan map released at the San Jose meeting provides a clear idea of the company\u2019s vision. As for the design, the intention is to preserve some of the industrial characteristics of the San Jose neighborhood in the north portion of the village and focus on local retail and landscape in the south.\n\nFollowing the current plans for project development, Google will receive feedback from the San Jose residents and refine their plans for city application in October. San Jose\u2019s City Council will then formally review the project and take a final vote in fall of 2020, potentially allowing for a portion of the project to open by 2024.", "title": "Google reveals the future of its San Jose Transit Village", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['San Jose']"}, {"id": 140, "city": "['San Jose']", "url": "https://www.sanjoseinside.com/news/developer-proposes-turning-lidos-nightclub-building-into-office-retail-space/", "text": "A developer has submitted plans to tear down the former site of Lido\u2019s Nightclub in downtown San Jose. In a preliminary proposal given to the city\u2019s planning department last week, San Jose-based developer Urban Catalyst said it wants to redevelop the building on 30 S. First St.\u2014known as the Lido Building\u2014into a 76,000-square-foot mixed-use project comprising office and ground-floor retail space.\n\nThe plans also include the historic Knox Goodrich Building next door. While preserving much of the building\u2019s historical structure, the developer wants to make it building part of the lobby of the new building.\n\nJosh Burroughs, Urban Catalyst\u2019s COO and SVP of development, told San Jose Inside he doesn\u2019t yet know what tenants will occupy the building. But the company is hoping to attract small and medium-sized businesses, he said.\n\n\u201cWe really want to be a catcher\u2019s mitt for businesses that might be pushed out from some of the larger projects downtown,\u201d he said.\n\nUrban Catalyst hopes to start construction by April 2021.\n\nThe development, called Fountain Alley, is being followed closely because of its ties to a new federal tax program. If approved, the development would be San Jose\u2019s first \u201copportunity zone\u201d project. Opportunity zones are regions around the country that offer tax breaks to investors who put money into those areas.\n\nReal estate investors and developers have been particularly excited about the opportunity zone program, which was part of the tax bill signed into law last year by President Donald Trump. The tax break applies to investors who put capital gains\u2014the profit made from the sale of stock or property\u2014into funds that support development.\n\nThe idea is to encourage development in places that haven\u2019t historically seen it, although there have been some concerns it may speed up gentrification.\n\nBurroughs said that proposing a project in an opportunity zone makes finding money to build the project much easier because there\u2019s an added incentive for investors.\n\n\u201cIt gives us a whole new group of potential investors to invest in real estate,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a whole new tranche of money.\u201d\n\nDowntown is beginning to see a host of new developments, as developers hope to take advantage of Google\u2019s incoming campus and the extension of BART to the area. \u201cWe want to expedite the vision for downtown San Jose that\u2019s already in place,\u201d Burroughs said.", "title": "A look inside San Jose politics and culture", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['San Jose']"}, {"id": 141, "city": "['San Jose']", "url": "https://sanjosespotlight.com/san-jose-to-tackle-anti-displacement-amid-concerns-of-developers-on-panel/", "text": "Amid the region\u2019s housing crunch and an increasing homeless population, San Jose is searching for solutions to temper the ongoing crisis, as more families and communities of color are subject to displacement.\n\nIn response, the City Council on Tuesday will discuss anti-displacement strategies to curb the adverse effects of Silicon Valley\u2019s economic boom.\n\n\u201cThe City Council\u2019s study session on displacement in San Jose will provide a venue for councilmembers to learn more about the issue of displacement and about anti-displacement strategies that cities can employ,\u201d said Housing Director Jacky Morales-Ferrand. \u201cThe project uses community-centered and data driven research to understand gentrification, displacement, and to help identify policy interventions that support equitable development.\u201d\n\nThe city will discuss strategies that are rooted in the \u201cthree P\u2019s\u201d of housing policy \u2014 production, protection and preservation. Currently San Jose has a few policies to mitigate displacement, including an inclusionary housing ordinance that requires developers to set aside affordable units or pay a fee, long-term ground leases for affordable developments and tenant protections.\n\nStill, 40 percent of the city\u2019s population is at risk of being displaced, according to housing officials, the majority of whom are Latino, African American and Vietnamese.\n\nAccording to the city\u2019s study on urban displacement, nearly half of San Jose households are considered low-income, while only 23 percent of homes in the city are considered \u201caffordable\u201d or \u201crent stabilized.\u201d A whopping 77 percent of the city\u2019s housing stock is market rate, making displacement among some communities challenging to avoid. The city reports that displaced residents are more likely to become homeless, couch-surf or have new, long commutes.\n\nTo combat these alarming rates of displacement, city officials recommend acquiring private land and building affordable, high-density housing near transit, securing new funding for affordable housing projects and encouraging community land trusts in susceptible neighborhoods. They also suggested education on and enforcement of existing policies, and establishing a local living wage to provide long-term stability for those most at risk.\n\nMatt King, a community organizer with Sacred Heart, said protections such as a right to legal counsel for tenants, reducing the current 5 percent rent cap on rent controlled units and expanding rent control to duplexes are important steps to curb displacement.\n\nCriticism over landlord interests\n\nHousing officials who will present the anti-displacement study Tuesday will be joined by representatives from top business organizations, such as the silicon valley organization and the California Apartment Association, a point of contention for many housing advocates.\n\nThey claim the landlords and business lobbies were added to the panel at the eleventh hour after a council committee chaired by Mayor Sam Liccardo twice voted to delay the anti-displacement study session.\n\nSome of those developer and landlord representatives who will speak on displacement Tuesday include Jeff Zell, a property manager, and Shawn Milligan of KT Urban, a real estate development firm.\n\n\u201cInviting developers and a landlord\u2026 makes it hard to believe this study session is an act of good faith,\u201d King said. \u201cWe can only hope the mayor and councilmembers care more about the people they represent than the people who fill their campaign coffers. In November, the mayor wants to dismantle our Ellis Act policy and make it easier to bulldoze affordable housing for luxury apartments. That is a failure of leadership. With political courage and a bold agenda we can keep people in their homes.\u201d\n\nAs a landlord in Mountain View, Zell had refused to comply with rent control after it was approved by voters in 2016 in an act of \u201ccivil disobedience,\u201d instead sending a letter to his tenants claiming that he planned on increasing the rent and evicting tenants who didn\u2019t pay up. Housing advocates say developer KT Urban has been heavily involved in lobbying against the Ellis Act, a protection that many housing advocates say is crucial to preventing displacement.\n\nHousing officials on Tuesday will also discuss displacement strategies adopted by other cities and discuss whether those strategies would be feasible in San Jose. The city will publish its report on anti-displacement in November.\n\nPlanning Commission appointment\n\nAlso on Tuesday, the City Council will appoint two new commissioners to the city\u2019s Planning Commission.\n\nFor the last few months, the city\u2019s East Side community has been up in arms over the appointment of a new commissioner \u2013former Councilmember Pierluigi Oliverio \u2014 after he was chosen to replace Ada Marquez, making him the fourth member on the 7-panel commission from affluent District 6.\n\nWhen the second vacancy opened after John Leyba\u2019s departure, City Clerk Toni Taber said no new applicants would be considered. A week later, a fourth entrant was added to the mix of applicants.\n\nThe four contenders include Mariel Caballero, a Santa Clara County deputy director at the probation department; Louis Barocio, vice principal at a East Side Union High School District; business owner Rolando Bonilla; and attorney George Casey.\n\nThe drawn out saga has attracted intense scrutiny from both sides of the political aisle, especially raising red flags from minority groups who are demanding more representation on the powerful commission.\n\nLast week, SOMOS Mayfair and Councilmember Magdalena Carrasco held a news conference decrying the lack of transparency over the fourth entrant \u2014 Casey \u2014 and highlighting concerns over racial representation on the influential panel ahead of Tuesday\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cOur job is making sure that we do what we can to represent our districts,\u201d Carrasco said during the news conference. \u201cAt the end of the day, we have to have a bigger, much broader, diverse and well represented vision, which is an inclusive vision.\u201d\n\nFireworks ordinance\n\nCity leaders are brainstorming new strategies to curb the use of illegal fireworks and displays, following years of complaints from San Jose residents fed up with the dangerous sparklers.\n\nOn Tuesday, city officials will receive an update on the city\u2019s fireworks ordinance, which intends to provide stronger solutions for enforcement of the city\u2019s ban.\n\nThe city in recent years has beefed up enforcement for illegal fireworks by using a new reporting system for the public to report illegal activity through a phone line and online tool. Yet, the city is still experiencing problems with the system and its reliability.\n\nAs of this year, only 42 percent of the tool\u2019s users reported that it was easy to use, according to a city report. This past year, a total of 1,946 online reports were received, but only 161 were considered \u201cactionable.\u201d During Fourth of July, a total of 787 calls were made, but only 68 were answered.\n\nWhile the city struggles to deploy additional police officers to handle fireworks complaints, the department seized 300 pounds of illegal fireworks this past July and has increased its presence in neighborhoods where fireworks are reported the most.\n\nA total of 464 calls were received during the Fourth of July period last year.\n\n\u201cThe city has made major progress on all components of the program, however, there continues to be blatant illegal use of fireworks within the city limits,\u201d said San Jose Fire Chief Robert Sapien. \u201cThe team continues to develop methods to define, gather, normalize and track data that can be used to make program adjustments and/or develop policy changes.\u201d\n\nSapien said improving the online tool so that users can accurately report a complaint with a potential tutorial video may help make the process more efficient, in addition to increasing the number of public safety officers when suspected fireworks use might be high. The chief also suggested continuous education and outreach to help curb the use and sale of illegal fireworks.\n\nThe City Council will meet 1:30 p.m. Tuesday inside the council chamber at City Hall, 200 East Santa Clara Street in San Jose.\n\nContact Nadia Lopez at [email protected] or follow @n_llopez on Twitter.", "title": "San Jose to tackle anti-displacement amid concerns of developers on panel", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['San Jose']"}, {"id": 142, "city": "['Austin']", "url": "https://www.austinmonitor.com/stories/2020/08/study-pushes-city-toward-using-data-results-in-plans-to-address-homelessness/", "text": "The city and organizations working to solve homelessness will adopt a more data-heavy approach to achieving the goals of the 2018 Action Plan to End Homelessness. The move to handle contracts for homeless services in a results-focused way is expected to quickly bring about investments in permanent housing from foundations and private businesses.\n\nA recent summary of a study conducted by consultant Barbara Poppe and Associates notes that the city lacks a strong management approach in its efforts to combat homelessness, which negatively impacted decisions on setting priorities from the action plan, securing investments to remedy homelessness and measuring the results of those investments.\n\nAs a result of the study, the new Public-Private Partnership Task Force to End Homelessness was formed and is meeting weekly to create a data-driven plan for adding permanent supportive housing and other resources. Member organizations of the task force include the city of Austin and Ending Community Homelessness Coalition as well as the Downtown Austin Alliance, Caritas of Austin, Front Steps, Integral Care, LifeWorks, and the Salvation Army.\n\nMatt Mollica, executive director of ECHO and co-chair of the task force, said one of the existing hurdles to using data for planning around homelessness was that programs from different organizations measured many kinds of data in non-uniform ways, which made it difficult to gauge their effectiveness and coordinate.\n\nHe said looking closely at metrics such as programs\u2019 retention rate, tracking exits and where clients go after exiting a program, measuring increases in income through employment or benefits, and overall improvement in quality of life will help task force members improve their programs.

It\u2019s about helping projects be more impactful,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s about where we are getting the data, and are we using the Homeless Management Information System in the right way?

To help meet the rising demand, the city is looking to remove some of its structural barriers that may limit the flexibility and reach of local food pantries.\n\nAllen Schroeder, founder of local nonprofit Save the Food Austin, participated in a prior city-led working group on food salvage efforts. He told the Austin Monitor that the central barrier is that the city doesn\u2019t allow food pantries to reportion large servings of food from restaurants or delis into smaller giveaway-sized portions, thus limiting their options and sources for food distribution.\n\n\u201cThe city won\u2019t allow that to happen inside of a pantry unless you have a kitchen permit and you have a certified food handler in that pantry, which is ridiculous, because, you know, who\u2019s got that?\u201d Schroeder said. \u201cTo be a certified kitchen you have to have a double sink, you have to have a mop sink, all your surfaces have to be stainless steel, you have to show that you\u2019re running it like a kitchen. Pantries can\u2019t do that.\u201d\n\nCity Council approved a resolution Wednesday calling on the city manager to pause enforcement of any restrictions on food charities that do not impact community safety or health at least through the end of the year. The resolution also asks for a new task force to address other ways to amend and simplify the city\u2019s Food Enterprise permitting process to encourage organizations to step in and offer their services.\n\nCouncil\u2019s request is a continuation of a previous effort by a 2019 working group of the Austin Travis County Food Policy Board, whose final recommendation requested such a task force to guide the permit revision process.\n\nOnly 24 percent of food recipient organizations in Austin and Travis County have gone through the process of receiving a food establishment permit in order to handle foods considered potentially hazardous. While no permit is required to donate pre-packaged dried foods like soup cans, cereal boxes or bottled water, donations of foods like cut tomatoes or melons, dairy products, fresh shell eggs, meats or cooked foods must be approved by the Austin/Travis County Health and Human Services Department.\n\nThe city holds charitable feeding organizations that deal with food requiring time and temperature control to the same standards as restaurants, but many food pantries are volunteer-led and lack the time and resources to complete the permit process. They often operate out of temporary borrowed spaces and have little authority to make physical changes to bring them up to city standards of a proper kitchen.\n\nCity of Austin food service permit fees range from $359-$896 depending on the size of the establishment and food risk category. The fee amounts are one of the factors the task force \u2013 made up of members of the Austin Travis County Food Policy Board, community stakeholders and city staffers \u2013 is asked to address in the coming months. Council has requested the group summarize its preliminary findings for the Oct. 27 work session and prepare a final report with any fee changes by Nov. 12.\n\nSchroeder said he would be willing to join the task force if invited, although he works only in packaged goods and would not be directly impacted by the permit process revisions. While Save the Food supports relaxing restrictions on food pantries, the organization\u2019s primary objective is to reduce food waste by partnering with local grocery stores to bring residents packaged foods that would otherwise be discarded.\n\nIn recent years, Schroeder has tried pressuring Austin Resource Recovery to encourage restaurants and grocery stores to donate food rather than composting, but said the effort has so far been \u201cvery complicated\u201d and met with a lot of hesitancy from the city. \u201cThe food business here in Austin is very powerful. They don\u2019t like politicians telling them what to do and to say that you have to put your food aside for a nonprofit to come and pick it up, that\u2019s too invasive,\u201d he said.\n\nPhoto made available through a Creative Commons license.\n\nThe Austin Monitor\u2019s work is made possible by donations from the community.

Cochran embodied Austin's famous \"Keep Austin Weird\" saying and a statue is being erected in his honor.\n\nLured by affordability, the eclectic lifestyle and Austin\u2019s natural beauty, people are coming in droves.\n\nThe city \u2014 the most liberal major metro in the state \u2014 has become one of the fastest-growing cities in the country. From 2017 to 2018, about 145 people a day were moving to Austin, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.\n\nIn 2010, there were a little more than 800,000 people living in Austin, according to the U.S. census. By 2018, the population ballooned 20% to 964,000 people.\n\nThe city's job market is thriving \u2014 largely due to the tech industry \u2014 and that is one of the reasons for the influx of new residents, according to USA Today.\n\nAustin\u2019s population is expected to hit 1 million by next year.\n\nAs new residents move in, longtime residents are being displaced.\n\nIn the past five years, rent has grown by 17.2%, compared to the national average of 13%, according to Curbed Austin, citing a study on Apartment List.\n\nA Freddie Mac report released in June found that only 18% of new apartment units built after 2010 were for very low income households. Prior to 2010, 35% of units built were for very-low-income residents.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s most concerning is that the loss in affordable housing units happened even though Austin\u2019s supply of multifamily housing grew,\u201d Freddie Mac Vice President of Multifamily Research Steve Guggenmos said to HousingWire. \u201cNearly a quarter of Austin\u2019s units were built after 2009 and a high percentage of these new units are not affordable for very-low-income renters. Like a lot of cities, they just can\u2019t keep up.\"\n\nAustin\u2019s homeless situation is getting worse. The number of homeless people in the city reached 2,255, up 5% from the previous year, according to CBS Austin.\n\nBisnow/Joseph Pimentel\n\nAuthor Ron Seybold shows how large a flower eccentric and well-known Austinite Leslie Cochran used to wave around in downtown Austin.\n\nLast month, the Austin City Council approved a new $8.6M 100-bed homeless shelter. The city is also allowing homeless people to sit, sleep and set up tents on the sidewalk or any public areas as long as they are not blocking a pathway.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott tweeted he plans to override the council's ruling.\n\nAs Austin boomed, builders didn't provide enough affordable housing stock for low-income renters.\n\nLyft driver Jose Gutierrez, 36, moved to Austin three years ago. Originally from Laredo, Gutierrez said she has noticed rent going up and gentrification seeping in.\n\n\"You see them on the streets,\" Gutierrez said, referring to homeless people. \"There are some people being displaced because of all these new developments. But I hope the developments won't too severely impact longtime residents.\"\n\nMichele Sandoval, 63, an information technology project coordinator, moved to Austin eight years ago to start over after getting a divorce.\n\nSandoval said she loves living in the city.\n\n\"People are nice and there are so many things to do,\" Sandoval said.\n\nBut she also noticed the influx of new residents.\n\n\"It's crazy,\" she said. \"They can't build housing fast enough.\"\n\nAsked if Austin can keep it weird, she said only if the new residents embrace the city's eclectic culture.\n\nWriter's Workshop Director and author Ron Seybold has lived in Austin for 41 years. Seybold recalls a time when the city's popular Dirty Sixth Street was a collection of skid row dive bars.\n\nSome of the areas around downtown were fruit stands where farmers sold peaches, he said.\n\nThe single-family homes in Northwest Austin were selling for $40K and it was so new, Seybold said, tarantulas and scorpions were commonplace.\n\nSeybold predicts as more people come to live in Austin, it will get harder for young families to find an affordable house within the city. He said housing is Austin's No. 1 problem.\n\n\"They are going to move out and further away from the city,\" Seybold said. \"We're on a trajectory here to keep people out that don't have economic wherewithal to get started. I don't see them fixing the housing problem in the next 10 years.\"\n\nHowever, Seybold does like the influx of new residents and jobs. It is a bit of a Catch-22.\n\n\"The world is coming to Austin,\" Seybold said. \"There's plenty of talent, imagination and passion. ... This is a beautiful place, with a progressive mindset. I think there's a nice interaction of ideas here that have been established and those that can make those better.\"", "title": "As Tech Moves In, Little Austin Facing Big-City Challenges", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Austin']"}, {"id": 145, "city": "['Austin']", "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/11/18260154/austin-scooters-bird-lime-uber-jump-sxsw-2019-dangerous-future-urban-transit", "text": "Last Saturday night, for the first time in my four years of attending SXSW, I thought I was going to die. I crossed the road at the pedestrian crosswalk next to the Austin Convention Center, and four people \u2014 each traveling approximately 15 miles per hour on electric scooters \u2014 darted around me.\n\nNot only did I not see or hear them coming \u2014 the mostly silent scooters have lights that automatically activate at night, but they can still be hard to spot in the dark \u2014 but I also had no idea what the best course of action was. I simply froze in place, standing in the middle of the street as the scooter riders whizzed by, having the time of their lives. Would I have died if struck? Probably not, and a motor vehicle in the same situation would have been a much graver threat. But in that moment, I felt genuine fear. My heart rate spiked, and for moments afterward, I felt shaken up and on high alert, wary of the countless other scooter riders that could be one mistake away from sending me to the emergency room.\n\nThis situation likely sounds familiar to any of the hundreds of thousands of festival attendees at this year\u2019s SXSW, the annual tech, music, film, and marketing meetup. The scooters, nonexistent at last year\u2019s festival, are everywhere in Austin this week, with thousands of vehicles concentrated in the roughly 1.5-square-mile area stretching from the Texas Capitol to the intersecting Colorado River. The result is attendees operating them at high speeds both through dense crowds on the sidewalk and among busy automobile street traffic. No one is wearing a helmet. And messy heaps of scooters are scattered across Austin\u2019s sidewalks and public spaces.\n\nSome of the astounding sights I\u2019ve seen in the past few days include multiple vicious-looking wipeouts, a man cranking the accelerator and doing donuts in a crowded parking lot, and scooters littering the gutters of East 6th Street while throngs of people avoid tripping over them. At one point, I read that a man was found riding one down the shoulder of an Austin highway. Riders here are disregarding all manner of street signage and traffic lights; some people flagrantly speed the wrong way down streets.\n\nMultiple police checkpoints litter the edges of off-limits areas \u2014 Austin has made certain that popular blocks, like downtown\u2019s Rainey Street, are no-scooter zones \u2014 so officers can herd hundreds of scooters into makeshift parking lots. And yet, I\u2019ve never seen so many people so thoroughly enjoying themselves as they maneuver from panels to parties, bars, and restaurants. Perhaps the recklessness is part of the fun, but even a cursory Twitter search turns up innumerable scooter evangelists who\u2019ve been converted by their time in Austin.\n\nScooters have been messy from the jump. Bird first dumped its scooter fleet into the Santa Monica area of Los Angeles in fall 2017. Since then, municipal governments and the general public have been dealing with the injury risks, urban cultural effects, and makeshift regulatory environment surrounding the scooter movement, which has ballooned into a multibillion-dollar industry.\n\nThe SXSW scooter situation is a fitting experiment that shows us what cities may look like in five years\n\nThe scooters first arrived in Austin last April when the city declared itself a hub for experimentation with \u201cmicromobility,\u201d a buzzwordy euphemism for rentable bikes and scooters designed to take you short distances. In the ensuing 11 months, Bird, Lime, Uber-owned Jump, Lyft, and Spin, among other smaller ventures, have happily moved in.\n\nHere in Austin during SXSW, the large-scale scooter deployment is thanks to the city\u2019s 10 licensed operators, each with permits that allow 500 vehicles in downtown Austin. The result is a fascinating test case in how the micromobility trend fares in an extremely dense, highly populated area with unfettered access to electric vehicles at all times.\n\nOver the years, SXSW has shifted its tech focus away from mobile apps to far-future subjects like AI, self-driving cars, and cryptocurrencies. Its significance as a gathering of celebrities, executives, and industry experts has waned since the days when it helped kickstart Twitter; now, it mostly exists as a place for brands to self-promote and employees to party every night and gorge on tacos. But it\u2019s still a destination for, at the very least, finding out what the biggest people in media, tech, and Hollywood think might be The Next Big Thing, even if that thing is inevitably a failure.\n\nNow, the scooter explosion feels like the most talked-about development the show has seen since live-streaming app Meerkat broke onto the scene here in 2015. For a festival that bills itself as a peek into the future, the scooter frenzy is a remarkably fitting experiment that shows us what cities might look like five or 10 years from now. The answer so far: equal parts urban transit nightmare and genuinely transformative social change.\n\nLast year\u2019s SXSW brought an influx of more than 430,000 people to Austin, with a vast majority of people concentrated in the downtown area near the city\u2019s convention center. Although Austin suspended licensing for adding new dockless electric vehicles to the mix back in January, while it reassesses its current contracts, that\u2019s still left more than 17,500 licensed electric vehicles on city streets. Most of the scooter companies appear to have moved a majority of their fleets to downtown to capitalize on the opportunity.\n\nWith that many available, it\u2019s no wonder that attendees seem to love the scooters. (They wouldn\u2019t be a controversial subject if they sat unused, after all.) The process of getting around downtown for panels and attending events and parties used to be a slog from a series of hotels to the convention center and back, resulting in some turbulent history in recent years around regulating Uber and Lyft. Now, thanks to the scooters, it\u2019s a brief and often enjoyable ride that saves you time and can cost as little as 50 cents.\n\nBird, Lime, and Uber are allowing Austin residents to use the vehicles free of charge to start, with a cost of just 15 cents per minute after that. In other markets, the companies tend to charge a flat fee of either $1 or sometimes $2.50, depending on whether you\u2019re using a scooter or a bike. What that says about the sustainability of companies like Bird and Lime is not immediately clear. After charging and maintenance costs, as well as the money spent fishing scooters out of lakes and freeing them from impound lots, most scooter companies are left with a small fraction of each ride, while some actually lose money. Regardless, both Bird and Lime have earned valuations of around $2 billion each.\n\nFun and cheap as they may be, scooters come with serious risks. Traveling at that speed, a scooter rider may seriously injure themselves or a pedestrian, and using one in traffic without a bike lane to protect you, as the law requires, means you may be mowed down by an automobile. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention even launched the first study of electric scooter accidents at the request of Austin\u2019s Public Health and Transportation departments. Speaking with local publication Hilltop Views last week, an emergency room nurse at the city\u2019s St. David\u2019s Medical Center said that the institution admits around 50 people per week with electric scooter injuries.\n\nScooters are so easy and cheap that the public is embracing them, despite the risks\n\nMeanwhile, cities are now grappling with large-scale scooter deployments that drastically affect sidewalks, public spaces, and roads. That\u2019s all while the existence of low-cost, venture capital-funded scooters make it much less likely that public transportation like rail and bus networks receive the necessary funding and support required to improve \u2014 or even function.\n\nThe scooter companies appear to be trying to make amends for their irresponsible beginnings. Uber-owned Jump is giving out helmets to any SXSW attendee who requests one, although I have yet to see a helmet rack. Jump also requires you to now take a photo of your scooter after you park it to ensure you\u2019re not leaving it somewhere especially egregious, although that seems to be doing little to curb bad behavior.\n\n\u201cTo prepare for the increase in demand, we have ramped up our team on the ground who are available 24/7 to move any incorrectly parked scooters or bikes to the designated parking areas,\u201d an Uber spokesperson said in a statement given to The Verge. \u201cWe are also in regular communication with the city and will continue to work with them to help quickly address any issues.\u201d The company says it has a ground team dealing with the helmet issue as well as \u201cproviding resources to encourage riders to follow the rules of the road,\u201d although that seems unsuccessful.\n\nLyft, to its credit, says it\u2019s built the first on-the-ground scooter parking stations in Austin specifically to help \u201ccalm the chaos\u201d of SXSw, a spokesperson told The Verge. The company also launched what it calls a \u201cscootiquette\u201d program to educate riders on best practices and how to follow the law. The program even comes with a flashy, illustration-heavy infographic designed to inform people about permitted and prohibited scooter use.\n\nScooter companies are experimenting with parking stations and financial incentivizes\n\nBird declined to comment specifically on SXSW, but it did point The Verge to Austin\u2019s John-Michael V. Cortez, special assistant to the mayor, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Prior to the event, Austin Transportation Director Robert Spillar said, \u201cI\u2019m not really worried about it,\u201d when speaking about the scooter situation at SXSW last week with local NBC affiliate KXAN-TV. \u201dWhen I talk to my peers in other cities, they are just mesmerized with our very positive experience with this new, shared mobility technologies here in Austin,\u201d Spillar added. \u201cWe\u2019ve done way over a million rides here in Austin since we introduced them, and that\u2019s just huge \u2014 that is people not in cars traveling.\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Bird says it developed a battle plan for SXSW that was improved over time thanks to past experiments during the Austin City Limits Music Festival and in Atlanta during the Super Bowl. That involves partnering with hotels to create more ample sidewalk parking, working with the city to enforce the no-ride zones, and deploying a ground team to operate 24 hours a day to ensure that as little goes wrong as possible.\n\nSimilarly, Lime says it\u2019s using in-app notifications and guides to help riders use the scooters safely, and it\u2019s working with the city of Austin to issue fines for parking or riding in no-scooter zones. Lime is also incentivizing riders to park in designated areas by giving away discounts. Neither Bird nor Lime, however, would comment on the sidewalk clutter or rule-breaking that seems rampant this week at SXSW, with both companies reiterating that use in-app reminders and other methods of communication to ensure riders follow the rules and, if all else fails, defer to local police.\n\nWhile there\u2019s only been one panel that\u2019s explicitly designed around scooters, much of the substantive discussion here at SXSW feels relevantly centered on policy \u2014 in particular, policy that may rein in tech platforms. \u201cMoving fast and breaking things,\u201d Facebook\u2019s infamous early motto, is decidedly out of style.\n\nThat means that part of the blowback from scooter companies has to do with how they cribbed, in part, from the playbook of Facebook and more prominently from the playbook of Uber and Lyft, by dumping electric vehicles into city streets without permission. At one Oakland meeting about scooters, the companies blamed parents for children riding the scooters \u2014 even though no effort had been made to educate parents about whether children should use them before the vehicles were scattered all over the sidewalks.\n\nMoving from a web service or software product into the real world comes with a higher level of scrutiny. Bird and Lime are in the process of establishing better relationships with cities around the globe. In doing so, we might see improvements to safety, urban clutter, and the other issues that make scooters so polarizing that people toss them into lakes. Yet at SXSW, the snapshot of the future we\u2019re getting is one more prone to chaos than order \u2014 at least until a more peaceful equilibrium is reached between cities and scooter companies.\n\nUnlike a mobile app, the stakes with electric vehicles are life and death. If Austin this week is any indication of what\u2019s to come, scooters will inevitably arrive everywhere in short order, and the public will love them just enough to ignore the consequences. We just need to be prepared for what comes next.\n\nUpdate 3/11, 3:30PM ET: Added additionally information from Lyft about its scooter parking stations in Austin and a new education program around scooter etiquette.\n\nPhotography by Nick Statt / The Verge", "title": "A cyclone of scooters has descended on Austin for SXSW, for better or worse", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Austin']"}, {"id": 146, "city": "['Austin']", "url": "https://www.traffictechnologytoday.com/news/smart-cities/ford-and-austin-launch-city-one-challenge-program-to-help-improve-urban-mobility.html", "text": "Ford and the City of Austin in Texas have launched the Austin City:One Challenge, a co-creation and crowdsourcing program for residents, businesses and community groups to propose and pilot solutions that improve mobility.\n\nWhile Austin continues to be one of the fastest growing cities in the USA, that growth has also impacted mobility in the city.

The 1.3-mile Model Project will connect the south end of the existing S-Line Rail Trail to the intersection of Park and Stonewall streets near the Convention Center. The goal is to have the project completed in 2020.\n\nThere are many advantages to this connection, including multiple access points for the LaVilla and Brooklyn neighborhoods, the opportunity to connect to the McCoys Creek Greenway in the future and the fact that no land acquisition is needed. The total cost for this first trail segment is projected to be $3.6 million. Groundwork is currently raising\n\n$900,000, or 25 percent of the Model Project cost. For the balance of the funding, legislation will soon be introduced to move funds into the 2018-2019 Capital Improvement Projects (CIP) budget for design. Construction funds will be requested from City Council as part of the 2019-2020 CIP.\n\n\u201cAs we look ahead at creating a vibrant and bustling downtown, I am pleased to have the City partner with Groundwork Jacksonville to increase pedestrian and bicycle access to our natural spaces,\u201d said Mayor Lenny Curry. \u201cConnecting communities and celebrating our neighborhoods is what the Emerald Trail project is all about. We are a city on the rise and this important project will be a big part of changing the landscape of our downtown as we move forward.\u201d\n\nWhen complete, the Emerald Trail will encompass 19.7 miles of new trails connecting at least 14 historic neighborhoods and downtown to existing and/or planned trail segments including the S-Line Rail Trail, Hogans Creek, McCoys Creek, the Northbank and Southbank riverwalks and the FDOTs Riverside connection to San Marco, for a total of 30 miles of trails and linear parks.\n\n\u201cThe Emerald Trail will not only create unprecedented recreational opportunities in the urban core, it is a transformative transportation and economic redevelopment project,\u201d said Ehas. Groundwork sees Jacksonville\u2019s neighbor to the north as an example of the impact this project could have. \u201cIf you look at the Atlanta BeltLine, the direct economic impact is almost $4 billion thus far. We believe the Emerald Trail will deliver significant economic benefits to Jacksonville, as well,\u201d Ehas added.\n\nGroundwork Jacksonville developed the Emerald Trail Master Plan in collaboration with the PATH Foundation\u2014the organization responsible for building more than 280 miles of trails in Georgia\u2014and KAIZEN Collaborative, one of the Southeast\u2019s leading trail planning and design firms.\n\nAdvocates believe the Emerald Trail will be a catalyst for social and economic opportunity in Jacksonville, from encouraging healthy lifestyles and promoting public safety, to spurring neighborhood revitalization and economic development. The trail will link to 18 schools, two colleges and 28 parks among other destinations like restaurants, retail and businesses, with an additional 20 schools and 21 parks located within three blocks of the trail.\n\n\u201cEveryone involved in revitalizing Jacksonville is looking for ways to create a more livable, walkable, recreational downtown to attract residents, visitors and business expansion to the urban core,\u201d said Councilwoman Lori Boyer, District 5, a champion of downtown renewal and riverfront activation. \u201cThe Emerald Trail will help to accomplish this while also improving mobility and economic opportunity for those who currently live in the historic urban neighborhoods along the proposed trail.\u201d\n\nEmerald Trail Master Plan Tier 1\n\nTier 1 includes 6.8 miles of new trail at a cost of approximately $13.59 million:\n\nSegment 1 - Model Project: South end of S-Line on State Street to the intersection of Park and Stonewall streets.\n\nSegment 2 - Hogan Street Connector: Hogans Creek at 1st Street to the Northbank Riverwalk at the Landing.\n\nSegment 3 - Southwest Neighborhood Connector: Artist Walk under I-95 to the south end of the McCoys Creek Greenway on Edison Avenue.\n\nSegment 4 - S-Line Connector: Boulevard Street to East 21st Street.\n\nSegment 5 - Hogans Creek Greenway: S-line near 12th Street to Hogans Creek Greenway at North Laura Street.\n\n\n\nEmerald Trail Master Plan Tier 2\n\nTier 2 includes 14.1 miles of new trail at a projected cost of $17.44 million:\n\nSegment 6 - Westside Connector: McCoys Creek Boulevard at Leland Street to Florida C.

The event is scheduled to run from 6 to 8 p.m. at San Marco Preservation Hall, 1652 Atlantic Blvd.\n\nThe U.S. Forest Service funded studies in three Florida communities: Orange County, the City of Miami Beach and Jacksonville. Green Infrastructure Center Executive Director Karen Firehock said Jacksonville\u2019s is the final project in the state, and her team is working to wrap up the study soon.\n\n\u201cMany cities in Florida are suffering from too much standing water and polluted runoff, as rainwater picks up pollutants on the streets and carries them into surface waters,\u201d Firehock said. \u201cThis project is demonstrating how we can better utilize the city\u2019s existing trees to capture stormwater and where we can plant new trees to also soak up additional water.\u201d\n\nTrees help because they capture and retain rainwater before allowing it to evaporate back into the atmosphere.\n\n\u201cWhat that does is it sort of intercepts some water. That\u2019s less water that\u2019s falling onto streets and running off and causing standing water, flooding and other problems,\u201d explained Firehock.\n\nShe says the problem in older cities like Jacksonville is that much of the area is paved, meaning there\u2019s not as much space for trees to grow. Additionally, the city\u2019s tree canopy is getting old.\n\n\u201cSo if you have a beautiful live oak tree but it\u2019s been there for a long time, it might be getting toward the end of its life cycle,\u201d she said. \u201cSo if we don\u2019t plant new trees, we\u2019re not going to have that canopy in the future.\u201d\n\nThe urban tree canopy is the layer of tree leaves, branches and stems that provide tree coverage of the ground when viewed from above.\n\nResearchers are using detailed satellite imagery to map Jacksonville\u2019s canopy and to show where trees should be retained because they\u2019re already effectively soaking up water, as well as places where additional trees should be planted to help with the stormwater problem.\n\nAccording to Firehock, Jacksonville\u2019s canopy average is currently at about 42 percent, meaning \u201cif you were a bird flying over the city looking down, 42 percent of it would be covered by trees.\u201d\n\nBut downtown the tree canopy drops dramatically to about 10 percent.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not evenly distributed, so we want to find those places in the city where trees are lacking and try to add them so they can soak up water,\u201d said Firehock.\n\nWhile trees play a significant role in reducing urban stormwater runoff and improving water quality, they provide other benefits as well.\n\nResearch from social scientist Kathleen Wolf suggests trees have socio-economic impacts like lowering crime rates, improving health, raising property values and they can even lead to people spending more time in shopping centers.\n\nPlants also improve air quality and even help curb climate change and its impacts.\n\nTrees absorb carbon dioxide, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and global warming.\n\nFirehock said trees also help cool cities.\n\n\u201cYou can find a difference of 12 degrees cooler under a tree versus out in the street,\u201d she said. That also helps reduce energy costs. \u201cIt varies by area. It can be as much as 20 percent.\u201d\n\nAs Jacksonville\u2019s Urban Forest Manager Richard Leon puts it, trees are the answer to many of the city\u2019s issues.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019m in this position,\u201d he said. \u201cI honestly believe that trees play a role in mitigating all these things.\u201d\n\nLeon said the study will help the city figure out if there are any codes or ordinances that could be changed to improve the condition of urban tree canopies.\n\nThe city will host its final meeting on the study in Springfield on March 28.\n\nFirehock said it\u2019s great that the city is sponsoring these workshops, but most of the land in Jacksonville is privately owned.\n\n\u201cThe way we are going to be able to be most successful is if community members and businesses plant trees on their own properties,\u201d she said. \u201cThat will be critical, because a tree survives best when it\u2019s got enough room and space to grow, and the best place for a tree is really in somebody\u2019s yard. We can get them to survive on streets, but really, if we can get participation by community members that will really help.\u201d\n\nPhoto used under Creative Commons license.\n\nBrendan Rivers can be reached at brivers@wjct.org, 904-358-6396 or on Twitter at @BrendanRivers.", "title": "Because Trees Help Keep Pollution Out Of The St. Johns River, Jacksonville Is Mapping Them", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Jacksonville']"}, {"id": 155, "city": "['Jacksonville']", "url": "https://news.wjct.org/post/volunteers-sought-august-27-homeless-count", "text": "Changing Homelessness is looking for more volunteers to help with its upcoming summer homeless census.\n\nUnlike the federally mandated Point-in-Time Count that takes place each January, the August Surge is a local initiative.\n\nChanging Homelessness CEO Dawn Gilman said volunteers will be scouring Jacksonville\u2019s urban core and the beaches.\n\n\"Not counting shelters, not counting transitional housing, we are very focused on who is outside, unsheltered or street homeless.\"\n\nGilman says the summer census is a way for her organization to make sure homeless veterans identified in previous counts haven\u2019t fallen through the cracks.\n\nShe says volunteers will also be on the lookout for homeless 18-to-24 year olds as well as unsheltered women and children.\n\n\"I just got an email from our homeless school liaison at Duval County Public Schools.

I think we need to think about something else. What that is is up for debate,\" City Councilman Jim Love said.\n\nCity Council President Aaron Bowman told News4Jax that legislation filed as part of the settlement calls for $18 million regarding the Landing. According to Bowman, under the bill, $15 million would be used to settle litigation with JLI and Sleiman, which means lawsuits over the Landing will be dropped and the city of Jacksonville will get the property.\n\nBowman said $1.5 million would be used for subleased tenants to terminate their leases. He said he believes many tenants have already been notified and the city will help them get out of the leases, which will take several months. He said the remaining $1.5 million would be used for demolition, meaning the city has no intention of keeping the Landing as it currently is.\n\n\"This is what the mayor and JLI have come up with -- reasonable terms that they've agreed upon,\" Bowman said. \"If approved by the council, it'll be executed and it'll be over.

If other costs such as tougher building standards and buyouts were added, the estimates would be significantly higher.\n\nThe Center for Climate Integrity asserts that the cost for protecting Jacksonville breaks down to $3,990 per person.\n\nFlorida faces the greatest cost in the nation, should it decide to erect the estimated amount of seawalls needed: $75.9 billion for 9,243 miles of seawalls. To put that into perspective, the entire state budget for Florida was $85 billion in 2018, according to the Center for Climate Integrity.\n\n\u201cFlorida is by far the most heavily impacted state, with costs reaching nearly $76 billion statewide, 23 counties facing at least $1 billion in seawall expenses alone (and often far greater price tags according to local estimates), and 24 communities where building just this rudimentary level of coastal protection will cost more than $100,000 per person,\u201d the study\u2019s authors wrote.\n\nHowever, a local coastal engineer calls the report \u201cpretty sensationalistic.\u201d\n\nErik Olsen is a principal engineer at Olsen Associates, Inc and a member of Jacksonville\u2019s Adaptation Action Area Working Group, which is exploring policies to protect Jacksonville from an assumed 2-feet rise in sea level by 2060.\n\nHe said the purpose of the study is to be an eye opener. Olsen also points out that in Jacksonville\u2019s case, seawalls are only a partial solution, and one that would be primarily for areas along the St. Johns River.\n\nIn regards to coastal area, Olsen said, \u201cYou're not talking about the implementation of seawalls. Pragmatically, you're talking about dunes and increasing the elevations of your beach restoration projects.\u201d\n\nHigher seawalls will likely be part of the solution, though, along the riverbank at Friendship Park on the Southbank, for example.\n\n\u201cI have measured the elevation of the seawalls around downtown just to get an idea as to how they vary. You\u2019d have to raise it, probably, about two feet,\u201d he said.\n\nBut seawalls only address a part of the issue. \u201cYou can raise the elevation of the seawall, but it doesn\u2019t really, necessarily, affect the drainage,\u201d he said.\n\nHe points out that areas like parts of San Marco and Riverside can\u2019t drain fast enough into the St. Johns when big storms hit.\n\nThe Center for Climate Integrity claims the costs outlined reflect the bare minimum coastal defenses that communities need to build to \u201chold back rising seas and prevent chronic flooding and inundation over the next 20 years.\u201d\n\nOlsen\u2019s Jacksonville group hasn\u2019t made any specific recommendations yet. \u201cWe\u2019re only at the stage where we are identifying the area that we should be flagging as endangered,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Olsen does stress the need for lawmakers to elevate sea level rise on the priority list.\n\n\u201cWhen will elected officials begin to acknowledge that this is a phenomenon \u2014 just like schools, just like redevelopment \u2014 that this is a phenomenon that the city of Jacksonville needs to address?\u201d he said.\n\nThe report can be downloaded here and the data sets are available here.\n\nOn the topic of sea level rise and how the First Coast is adapting, WJCT News will soon launch a website called ADAPT.

In those cities when we look at the number of people there are more people biking and walking to work in those urban environments.

Is it having an impact?\n\nThe thought about ride-sharing was the idea that it would encourage people to consider either carpooling with their colleagues or carpooling with their companions, but one of the things that we know about ridesharing is that in fact that Uber and Lyft, particularly in other places like New York, have actually increased the amount of cars on the roadway. One of the things that we have to think about with ride-sharing is how do we balance [more cars]? When we look at the impact ride-sharing is having on public transportation overall it is eating into some of the public transportation.\n\nSouth Florida's biggest problem is too many cars on the road with just one person in them.\n\nWhat's happening with ride-sharing is that the cost of ride-sharing is a lot of times not much more inexpensive than maybe taking public transportation from a long distance.

Through a partnership between the City of Miami and Miami Downtown Development Authority (DDA), the Urban Land Institute (ULI) convened a panel of 10 experts from across the U.S. to study climate-related threats within the City\u2019s urban core, formulate recommendations for hardening the neighborhood\u2019s infrastructure and protecting its natural and manmade assets, and identify potential funding solutions for bringing resiliency projects to life.\n\nAs part of the ULI assessment, panelists toured Downtown Miami\u2019s vulnerable areas by land and water and interviewed more than 80 local stakeholders, producing a set of recommendations that were unveiled to the public on June 7, 2019 at Miami City Hall. The panel focused on strengthening the Biscayne Bay waterfront as Downtown Miami\u2019s first line of defense against rising seas, transforming the Miami River into a mixed-use district that bridges the gap between the water and surrounding neighborhoods such as Little Havana and Allapattah, and incentivizing responsible development along an inland ridge of high-lying ground. A more comprehensive report will be released by ULI in the coming months.\n\n\u201cTransforming Miami into a more resilient community means shifting our perception \u2013 from viewing the water as a threat, to thinking of the water as a natural asset that we should embrace,\u201d said City of Miami Commission Chairman Ken Russell, who also chairs the Miami DDA. \u201cThe Urban Land Institute\u2019s preliminary findings provide us with a roadmap for enacting design, infrastructure, zoning and financing strategies that will ensure Miami sustains its growth as a world-class city \u2013 not for years, not for generations, but forever.\u201d\n\nFollowing is a summary of the panel\u2019s recommendations:\n\nUpdate zoning and building guidelines to incorporate resilience principles, including adapting the code to meet minimum thresholds for insurance coverage and real estate market demand\n\nto incorporate resilience principles, including adapting the code to meet minimum thresholds for insurance coverage and real estate market demand Refine and adopt proposed design guidelines for the Miami Baywalk , to include resilient design features for a five-mile stretch of shoreline along Biscayne Bay and the Miami River\n\n, to include resilient design features for a five-mile stretch of shoreline along Biscayne Bay and the Miami River Promote the use of living shorelines across key regulatory agencies at all levels of government \u2013 City, County, State and Federal\n\nacross key regulatory agencies at all levels of government \u2013 City, County, State and Federal Install green infrastructure to reduce flood and heat impacts along the waterfront and in Miami\u2019s urban neighborhoods\n\nto reduce flood and heat impacts along the waterfront and in Miami\u2019s urban neighborhoods Create a place-based organization or conservancy to facilitate private investment and management for the urban waterfront\n\nto facilitate private investment and management for the urban waterfront Build consensus among community stakeholders through demonstration projects , such as creating a living shoreline along the Museum Park waterfront\n\n, such as creating a living shoreline along the Museum Park waterfront Explore resilient financing tools that leverage Downtown Miami\u2019s real estate market, including tools like Transferable Development Density, tax increment financing, and new property taxes that generate dedicated revenue for resilience initiatives\n\nthat leverage Downtown Miami\u2019s real estate market, including tools like Transferable Development Density, tax increment financing, and new property taxes that generate dedicated revenue for resilience initiatives Develop a long-range, comprehensive master planning document that incorporates resilience as a key element to guide development in Downtown and along the waterfront\n\nthat incorporates resilience as a key element to guide development in Downtown and along the waterfront Strengthen community preparedness in vulnerable locations through neighborhood outreach, emergency management, and local partnerships\n\nThe panel\u2019s recommendations coincide with a surge of development, investment and in-migration within Miami\u2019s urban core and along the Miami Riverfront. Home to a daytime population of more than 250,000 people and more than 92,000 full-time residents \u2013 representing a 40 percent increase since 2010 \u2013 Greater Downtown Miami is among the country\u2019s fastest-growing residential and commercial neighborhoods. The three-square-mile district encompasses real estate assets valued at nearly $40 billion, including more than 53,000 residential units, 25 million square feet of office space, 8,000 hotel rooms, several interconnected transit systems, and a host of public museums, parks and cultural venues.\n\n\u201cMiami enlisted this panel of experts with the goal of gathering independent perspective on how we plan, design and pay for the changes we need to make along our waterfronts to adapt and thrive in this changing climate,\u201d explains Jane Gilbert, Chief Resilience Officer for the City of Miami. \u201cThe ULI panel recommendations both validate the critical importance of the steps the City has already taken, including the updates to our Stormwater Master Plan, Miami21 and initial infrastructure investments through the Miami Forever Bond and motivates the City to continue to strengthen interagency partnerships and resident and business engagement needed to move forward with innovative design and financing solutions.\u201d\n\nScientific research indicates that Miami, like many coastal cities, faces the prospect of rising seas and warmer temperatures over the coming decades. Water levels are expected to rise between two and two-and-a-half feet by 2060, according to the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact. At the same time, the number of 90-degree days in Miami is expected to rise from 130 to 180 days per year by 2080.\n\n\u201cDowntown Miami is experiencing an incredible period of economic and urban growth, and the presence of an accessible and continuous waterfront is among the district\u2019s most valuable assets,\u201d observed panel chair Ladd Keith, Chair of the Sustainable Built Environments program at the University of Arizona. \u201cMiami is already making strides toward becoming a stronger community in the face of a changing climate through collaborations like the Resilient305 strategy, and now the City must learn how to protect from, live with and create value from the water. That process begins with ushering in built and living infrastructure and quality of life upgrades along the waterfront, exploring forward-looking regulatory, zoning and policy changes, identifying creative financing solutions, and prioritizing community education and preparedness.\u201d\n\nKeith was joined by panel vice chair Michelle Beaman Chang, founder and chief executive officer, Imby Community, Inc., Washington, D.C.; Jason Bonnet, vice president of development, Brookfield Properties, San Francisco, California; Samia Byrd, deputy county manager, Arlington County Government, Arlington, Virginia; John Macomber, senior lecturer in the finance unit, Harvard Business School, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts; Michael Rodriguez, leader, market research and insights, mid\u2010Atlantic region, CBRE, Inc., Washington, D.C.; Susannah Ross, landscape architect, Boston, Massachusetts; Matt Steenhoek, vice president of development, PN Hoffman, Washington, D.C.; Byron Stigge, founder, Level Infrastructure, New York, New York and Jay Valgora, founder and principal, Studio V Architecture, New York, New York.\n\nA video recording of the panel\u2019s June 7, 2019 presentation is available online here.

But, over the past several years, the Bayou City has become much more densely populated, as more and more people continue to move here.\n\nThis has brought a renewed focus on urban living, and the many conveniences that such a lifestyle can afford. This includes a long list of amenities, and the increased desire among residents for walkability. This represents a bit of a shift for Houston, which has always been a city dominated more by cars than pedestrians.\n\nToday, Houston boasts of a very vibrant urban environment, which is attracting both local residents and newcomers alike.\n\nUrban lifestyle draw\n\nAccording to Kelly Pachar, a Realtor with Heritage Texas Properties, many of his relocation clients are drawn to the urban lifestyle because of the trend toward urbanization that is taking place across the country.\n\n\u201cA lot of people who are moving here have had urban experiences in other cities, so they want it again in Houston. There are also other people who have lived in the suburbs in another city, but they always wanted to do the urban thing, so their move now gives them that opportunity,\u201d said Pachar.\n\nHe added that people really enjoy the convenience of being able to take advantage of the many cultural events and entertainment options that Houston has to offer, without having to drive a long distance to get there.\n\nBut, Pachar said that convenience does come at a cost.\n\nLiving in one of Houston\u2019s more popular urban locations can be relatively more expensive than housing options in other areas, and there might be certain aspects that home buyers would need to give up in favor of the lifestyle.\n\nSome \u2018sacrifices\u2019\n\nFor example, it might be necessary for home buyers to give up square footage, a large backyard, or a three-car garage in order to be in the area where they want to live.\n\n\u201cWhen I first started in real estate 12 years ago, Midtown was the hopping area, and if people couldn\u2019t afford Midtown, then we would go to EaDo. Now, EaDo is as expensive or more expensive than Midtown, so I am always looking at what some of the other up-and-coming areas are for my clients.\n\n\u201cI think part of being a good Realtor is knowing those transitional adjacent neighborhoods, which can give people an alternative,\u201d Pachar said.\n\nFor people who are moving here and are not sure whether urban living is really for them, Pachar said that renting can be a great way to try it before making a purchase.\n\n\u201cLeasing gives people the ability to test drive both the lifestyle and the community. If someone is moving here from another city, even if they have been here many times, they won\u2019t be able to really get to know the city until they are here every day,\u201d Pachar said.\n\nClint Simpson, a Realtor associate with Greenwood King Properties, is also seeing a big push among his out-of-town home buyers toward an urban lifestyle.\n\n\u201cMy clients like the walkability to all of the retail shops and restaurants, and everything else that is close by,\u201d said Simpson.\n\nFor the most part, he said that when his clients are evaluating areas, one of the top considerations is the accessibility to work. This makes areas such as the Memorial Park area, the Washington Avenue area, and Montrose highly sought after.\n\n\u201cA lot of these clients have offices located downtown, so being in these areas brings them much closer to the downtown area and their offices, which is a big plus,\u201d Simpson said. \u201cThey also like the ability to be close to nature in Memorial Park and Discovery Green.\u201d\n\nIn terms of the affordability of different areas and neighborhoods, he said that housing costs depend on the location.\n\n\u201cProperty values are typically higher the closer you get to downtown, with the exception of EaDo, because EaDo is such a transition area and is considered up and coming. There are still lots of properties there that are being refurbished, rebuilt or completely torn down and replaced by new construction,\u201d said Simpson.\n\nHe also said that urban living has an appeal for a wide variety of clients, in various stages of their lives. So, it\u2019s not necessarily a trend characterized by a younger generation of people. He said that it\u2019s all about the lifestyle choice.\n\n\u201cI find that people with children want to be outside of the downtown area, but people who don\u2019t have children yet, or have children who are older or grown want to be closer in and more urban,\u201d Simpson said.\n\nMichelle Sandlin is an award-winning writer, journalist and global mobility industry expert.

Apartment floor plans will range from studios with separate sleeping alcoves to large two-bedroom units. The shops will ring a central plaza designed by Houston-based OJB Landscape Architecture.\n\nJLL has been tapped to oversee retail leasing for the entire mixed-use district along West Dallas Street between College Memorial Park Cemetery and Waugh Drive, across Allen Parkway from Buffalo Bayou Park.\n\nGID announced plans to develop Regent Square in 2007. At that time, the property housed the Allen House Apartments, which GID had owned for decades. Most of the apartments were demolished, but the project stalled until GID built a 21-story apartment tower at 3233 W. Dallas. That building, called the Sovereign, was completed in 2015.\n\n\u201cOur goal for Regent Square is the creation of an exemplary, urban mixed-use district in the heart of Houston. Phase 2, the core of the masterplan, is poised to establish the project as a dynamic, walkable place as it weaves high quality restaurants, retail and residential into the fabric of the surrounding neighborhoods,\u201d James Linsley, GID\u2019s president, said in a statement.\n\nLower Heights District, designed by Gensler, is also designed to be open and walkable, with small plazas and green spaces. Diners will spill onto outdoor restaurant patios and the project, near the hike and bike trail, will cater to trail users as well as nearby residents, the developer said.\n\nGulf Coast said there are plans to develop a 120,000-square-foot office building constructed with cross-laminated timber wood panels made from several layers of lumber glued and stacked that is said to be an environmentally friendly construction material.\n\nTrammell Crow Residential is developing the apartment complex under construction at Lower Heights District. Completion is expected mid-2020. Total Wine and Ulta Beauty have finalized leases for the retail space underway, but the developer would not reveal names of the other tenants it is talking to.\n\nnancy.sarnoff@chron.com\n\ntwitter.com/nsarnoff", "title": "Lower Heights District, Regent Square developers disclose plans for their urban sites", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "['not_sure']", "annot_city": "[]"}, {"id": 169, "city": "['Houston']", "url": "https://www.houstonchronicle.com/opinion/outlook/article/Good-Reason-aims-to-make-all-of-Houston-s-14070606.php", "text": "There are 900,000 children who call Harris County home \u2014 children with dreams of becoming teachers, scientists, entrepreneurs, and leaders \u2014 but the reality is, we are not providing all our children with the education they need to achieve their dreams.\n\nHalf a million of our children attend school in Houston\u2019s urban core \u2014 districts centrally located in Harris County where more than 70 percent of the students are economically disadvantaged. More than half of them are not receiving the type of education that will propel them to futures filled with opportunity.\n\nIn August our schools will receive letter grades from the Texas Education Agency. Assuming no significant changes, more than 300,000 students across Houston\u2019s urban core will be learning in schools rated C, D or F. We are facing an educational crisis, one that disproportionately affects our black, Latino, and low-income students.\n\nHouston, this cannot be the legacy we leave.\n\nThis is why, together, Houston Endowment and Kinder Foundation helped launch Good Reason Houston to champion a bold, optimistic vision for our region \u2014 that every child, in every neighborhood, excels in a world-class public school and thrives in the Houston of tomorrow.\n\nToday we are asking Houston parents, educators, leaders and community members to come together and join us to fulfill this vision.\n\nSince its launch in 2017, Good Reason Houston has been on a mission to increase the number of students achieving in great public schools, both traditional and charter. The organization brings best practices, financial resources, and staff time and expertise to local school systems to support strategies that will improve existing schools and create new high-performing ones.\n\nGood Reason Houston has set an ambitious goal: to increase the number of students learning in A and B schools by 60,000 by the end of the 2025-26 school year. While this is just a start, 60,000 represents a 30 percent increase over the number of students learning in A and B schools today. Phase I of this plan will see an increase of 10,000 more students in high-performing schools by the end of the 2020-21 school year.\n\nAs with any worthy effort, this plan costs money; an investment of $61 million from public and private sources is required, with $34 million from philanthropic investments. Our foundations have taken the first step by providing catalyst funding of $20 million for Phase I - this in addition to the funding we provided to launch Good Reason Houston.\n\nWe did so because we believe this is not only a critical investment in 300,000 children, but also a necessary investment in our city\u2019s future.\n\nAs all investors do, we did our homework. We researched how other cities address educational inequities, and we saw that to accomplish region-wide transformation, the vision and plan must be bigger than any one school and any one district.\n\nOther cities, including Washington, D.C., Dallas, and Indianapolis have organizations that keep the larger community laser-focused on a clear goal to accelerate student outcomes. We knew that\u2019s what was missing in Houston.\n\nFor the first phase, Good Reason Houston has partnered with Houston-area districts that primarily serve economically disadvantaged students \u2014 students who often attend our most persistently failing schools.\n\nSome of this work is already happening and being celebrated. For example, in the 2019-20 school year, Good Reason Houston will continue to support Aldine ISD\u2019s implementation of the Accelerating Campus Excellence (ACE) program at Goodman and Worsham Elementary Schools. The ACE model, which has been proven to dramatically improve student outcomes, brings a district\u2019s most effective educators to some of its most struggling schools.\n\nIn Dallas and Fort Worth ISDs, the ACE model resulted in 17 out of 18 Improvement Required campuses leaving that state list within one year, and 66 percent of the ACE schools are currently rated A or B by the Texas Education Agency. We look forward to watching Aldine have similar success.\n\nGood Reason Houston will continue to expand its footprint in the months and years ahead, partnering with more area school districts to implement innovative solutions. These solutions include strategic professional development for educators, replicating some of our region\u2019s high-performing schools, and creating new school models within districts.\n\nOur legislators showed a tremendous commitment to students across Texas with the passing of HB 3, and it is now our time to build on that commitment. This plan requires the entire Houston community to set aside differences of opinion and ideology and come together around a bold vision to achieve better outcomes for all our region\u2019s students.\n\nWe challenge everyone in the Houston community to join us in ensuring that all our students have the opportunity to attend a great school \u2014 the kind of school that gives each child, regardless of background or Zip code, the opportunity to seize their dreams.\n\nGood Reason Houston has earned our confidence for the initial work they have done already in bringing together our city\u2019s best talent and resources to prove what\u2019s possible. We are energized to be a part of this. If the rest of the community joins us, we all have good reason to be optimistic about what lies ahead.\n\nStern is president and CEO of Houston Endowment, and Kinder is president and CEO of Kinder Foundation.

The measure expands the use of so-called market-based parking, which already exists in the central business district.\n\nOpponents of parking minimums say the requirements produce an excessive number of parking lots that eat up space in the urban core, making it harder to traverse cities on foot or by public transit. Cities around the country have moved in recent years to eliminate or soften minimum parking regulations.\n\nHouston\u2019s move to lift the parking minimums comes as public debate plays out over a proposed state project to remake Interstate 45 and ahead of a likely November vote in which the Metropolitan Transit Authority is expected to ask voters for authority to borrow $3.5 billion to support a wave of transit projects.\n\nAs council members weighed Turner\u2019s proposal Wednesday, the discussion turned to the future of transportation and accessibility in Houston, where residents and development long have depended heavily on cars.\n\n\u201cIt seems to me that in a city of 600-plus miles, that we not only are now, but we are going to continue to be a city that\u2019s going to require access by vehicles of some sort \u2014 cars, Uber, whatever,\u201d District J Councilman Mike Laster said. \u201cI don\u2019t know how we develop a comprehensive transportation plan in the city and the county and the region if you don\u2019t implement a complementary parking plan to go with that.\u201d\n\nUrban planning experts generally say cities should seek to become less car-dependent as they become more dense, because cars take up a large amount of space, an argument made by Houston transportation planner Geoff Carleton in a recent Chronicle op-ed. Planners also say buildings located near public transit, such as Metro\u2019s light rail lines in Midtown and EaDo, should provide less parking than those located elsewhere.\n\nDistrict I Councilman Robert Gallegos, who represents the East End, cited a study Wednesday concluding cities tend to require too much parking near transit stations, stymieing development on valuable land.\n\n\u201cMore parking lots in our neighborhoods do not protect our neighborhoods,\u201d Gallegos said. \u201cWe need to realize that nowadays with taxis, with Uber, with Lyft, with rail, with bikes, all these parking lots around transit centers are not needed.\u201d\n\nTravis, the sole vote against the measure, grappled with his support for the free market and cutting regulations with his concern that stripping parking minimums would produce \u201cunintended consequences.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you do not have enough adequate parking, you don\u2019t have an adequate number of customers,\u201d Travis said. \u201cYou can walk, skip, crawl, I don\u2019t care what you do to get to these establishments. We are not high-density like New York.\u201d\n\nAt-Large Councilwoman Amanda Edwards backed the measure and suggested the city should try to partner with private firms to build parking garages that she said could bring revenue to the city.\n\nBefore the measure came before city council, it passed through several rounds of public vetting and feedback. The city\u2019s planning and development department introduced the concept last August to neighborhood groups and other stakeholders. Days later, the department brought the proposal before the city planning commission, which approved the measure, sending it to a city council committee.\n\nAlong the way, neighborhood group members weighed in at a series of public hearings. The chief opposition came from neighborhood leaders who said cars would overflow onto the streets of adjacent neighborhoods if businesses were not bound by parking minimums. Laster echoed that concern Wednesday.\n\nThose who supported the measure noted it does not restrict property owners from providing parking.\n\n\u201cThis does not mean that (developers) will not provide parking. It means they will provide as many parking spaces as the market dictates,\u201d Hector Rodriguez, an administration manager with the planning department, told council members at a council committee meeting in March.\n\nIn recent weeks, the proposal appeared to meet more resistance from those who argued it does not go far enough.\n\nThe planning department\u2019s first iteration would have exempted all of Midtown from the parking requirements. Turner agreed to remove east Midtown \u2014 south of McGowen and east of San Jacinto streets \u2014 from the exempted area, after Midtown super neighborhood leaders raised opposition to the measure.\n\nTurner later shot down pleas from the Midtown Management District to fold east Midtown back in, though the mayor said he intends to remove parking minimums in east Midtown if the measure proves successful.\n\nThe planning department initially considered expanding market-based parking into the Fifth Ward, too. Rodriguez said department staff supported the idea, but wanted more time to hear public feedback.\n\nMayor Pro Tem Ellen Cohen, whose District C includes some of the exempted area, said she supported the measure despite some opposition from neighborhood group members.\n\n\u201cNo one is going to be completely happy,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a shared sacrifice, so there\u2019s going to be a little discomfort on all sides.

Energy expert Joshua Rhodes said urban solar farms are becoming a trend in Texas.\n\n\u201cSince the price of solar (energy) has been dropping significantly, it\u2019s making more and more sense on these smaller scales,\u201d said Rhodes, a researcher at the University of Texas at Austin's Energy Institute. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see more development, you\u2019re starting to see communities decide that they want this.\u201d\n\nRhodes said it\u2019s sometimes hard to build new energy infrastructure in cities, so solar farms are seen as beneficial for the local power grid. Those grids don\u2019t store energy, so when a solar farm produces power \u201cthat means some other power plant, one that likely produces carbon dioxide, is not going to be producing as much power.\u201d\n\nSunnyside revitalization\n\nCity leaders also see the farm as a step toward revitalizing the Sunnyside neighborhood. Larissa Williams is the energy manager in the city's Office of Sustainability. She said the landfill where the farm will be built had become an \u201ceyesore\u201d and pointed at more affordable electricity as a positive outcome for residents.\n\nThe city and Wolfe Energy are currently working out the details of the lease for the land and a environmental feasibility study will be conducted.\n\nWolfe said she expects the farm to start operating in late 2020 or early 2021.\n\nSubscribe to Today in Houston Fill out the form below to subscribe our new daily editorial newsletter from the HPM Newsroom.

Those hazards may just affect someone else. But a new study aims to make the effects personal by showing how the climate may change in your city.\n\nPhiladelphia in 2080 will feel a bit more like the climate of current day Memphis, for instance. Researchers analyzed rainfall and temperature trends and compared them to climate models for 540 cities across the U.S. and Canada. Their results forecast a climate change \"twin city\" for the future of each urban area, writes Robinson Meyer for The Atlantic.\n\n\"Everything gets warmer,\" researcher Matt Fitzpatrick tells The Atlantic. Fitzpatrick is an associate professor at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science. \"I don't think I've seen a place that doesn't.\"\n\nWondering what the future may hold for a particular city? The researchers created a web tool that allows people to play around with locations and climate change scenarios and see for themselves. The cities analyzed are home to 75 percent of the population of the U.S. and 50 percent of the population of Canada.\n\nSummers in Washington, D.C., for example, are already pretty hot and sticky\u2014but just wait until the 2080s. Even with reduced carbon emissions, the nation's capitol is predicted to feel more like Paragould, Arkansas, where July temps regularly hover just above a sultry 90 degrees Fahrenheit, warmed by tropical air from the Gulf of Mexico. By comparison, Washington, D.C.'s July average high is just below 80 degrees. Say goodbye to the occasional snowpacolypse; Paragould currently gets an average of two inches of snowfall a year, according to U.S. Climate Data.\n\nAnd keep in mind this is basically a best case scenario. If the world continues to put out unchecked emissions, D.C. residents could expect to experience weather currently seen by the people in Greenwood, Mississippi, where it's way hotter and more humid than Paragould.\n\nOverall, cities in the northeast will tend to feel more like the subtropical climes found in the modern southeastern U.S., the researchers report in the journal Nature. Western cities should expect to feel more like the desert Southwest.\n\nIf the world doesn't cut back on emissions and climate change predictions hold true, the cities in the study will have conditions most similar to locations that are, on average, nearly 530 miles away from their modern day location.\n\nOne difficult finding is that many cities will experience change to a climate that doesn't look like anything currently in North America. \"It really underscores this dramatic transformation of climate that occur over the next 60 years, in the lifetime of children alive today,\" Fitzpatrick tells Rachel Becker at The Verge.\n\nThe analogy isn't perfect, particularly where rainfall is concerned. The researchers had to pick the analogous city with the best fit to the predictions. Also, the results only offer a picture of the average climate. Cold snaps, heatwaves and more complicated phenomena\u2014such as the effect of urban heat islands, where cities absorb more heat than surrounding areas\u2014aren't part of this model, reports Matt Simon at Wired.\n\nThe point of the paper is to try and get people to think about how climate change may affect them. Fitzpatrick and his co-author Robert R. Dunn, an applied ecologist at North Carolina State University, write:\n\n\"Translating and communicating these abstract predictions in terms of present-day, local, and concrete personal experiences may help overcome some barriers to public recognition of the risks (and opportunities) of climate change.\"\n\nThe study could even spur action, suggests Kevin Burke, a climate scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who was not involved in the new study. \u201cOne notable outcome of this work is the potential for cities and their analog pairs to transfer knowledge and coordinate climate adaptation strategies,\" Burke tells Wired.\n\nThe changes mapped in the tool only account for the actual conditions people might experience when they step outside. The other effects of climate change remain to be seen. Maybe future tools could help people see how floods and heatwaves could come to their hometown. Or what new invasive species, weeds, pests or diseases may become their neighbors. What tools like this cannot do is predict the unexpected challenges a warming climate may force upon us.", "title": "With Climate Change, Washington, D.C.

On a recent day, they included orange and purple carrots, dark green cucumbers, heads of green cabbage, green beans, and a milk crate of hardneck garlic. This mid-summer week, she also has baskets of blueberries, red gooseberries, yellow plums, heirloom tomatoes, Presidio rice, and bags of hand-milled flour.\n\nThen she awaits the arrival of 25 of her community supported agriculture (CSA) subscribers, who\u2019ve signed up to retrieve their weekly share from Three Part Harmony, a farm she established three-and-a-half miles from the White House.\n\nTaylor at a CSA pickup site in the city. (Photo by Cassie Chew.)\n\n\u201cI started with six CSA members on my porch, and now we do almost 200 shares, three days, and seven locations,\u201d Taylor says.\n\nGet the latest articles in your inbox.\n\n\n\nTaylor\u2019s efforts have not only led to the first production-focused organic farm and CSA accessible by bus or bike to D.C. residents. They have also led to the passage of legislation encouraging D.C. landowners to give their property over to agricultural purposes, helping make the nation\u2019s capital a more friendly place for urban farms.\n\nDistrict Councilmember David Grosso helped Taylor in her policy work. \u201cShe set up a model that wasn\u2019t just about community gardens, but more about the expansion of urban farming, to grow quality food closer to the source of consumption,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t about sharing a plot; it was bigger than that.\u201d\n\nMarla Karina Larrave, an advocate for justice in food and farming policy and Three Part Harmony CSA member, says, \u201cShe\u2019s definitely the people\u2019s farmer. In terms of farming, you\u2019re talking to the most awesome person in D.C.\u201d\n\nReturning to the Land\n\nTaylor\u2019s venture into farming took root during a self-described \u201cquarter-life crisis.\u201d With a degree in U.S. foreign policy and Latin America, she worked as a human rights advocate before quitting to spend nine months in Guatemala on a project to promote healing among women recovering from the trauma of civil war.\n\nThen, instead of continuing a career path in diplomacy when she returned, Taylor signed up to volunteer at a food co-op. A vegetarian since her teens, she wanted to learn more about food and have enough to eat while she was unemployed. She also began volunteering at an organic farm in rural Maryland.\n\n\u201cI was doing a lot of weeding and transplanting and more weeding,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cI loved it. I was like \u2018Oh my gosh, I never have to turn on a computer again.\u2019\u201d\n\nA dozen years later, her passion for farming has become her profession. \u201cMy favorite times this year were when I went to the farm on a Saturday afternoon, locked myself in the fence by myself, and worked until the sun went down,\u201d she says.\n\nWith farmers on both sides of her family tree, Taylor\u2019s connection to the land runs deep. But Taylor doesn\u2019t see her pivot into agriculture as unique to her personal family history. Rather, it\u2019s something she shares with many African Americans, who despite family histories of farm life that include exploitation, are rediscovering the land, redefining their role in the profession, and recognizing the power of food production in revitalizing their communities.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in part of this return generation\u2014young Black farmers who are returning to the land after having skipped a generation,\u201d she says.\n\nBut in order for Taylor to make her newfound mission to provide organic fruits and vegetables to her adopted community in D.C. a sustainable operation, Taylor also had to rely on her diplomacy skillset.\n\nThe \u201cI Want D.C. to Grow\u201d Campaign\n\nDuring her years as a farm hand, Taylor rose from volunteer to member of the vegetable crew to co-manager for the farm. In that time, she learned the most successful strategies for growing vegetables in the D.C. region, where warmer temperatures alter the growing season, as well as how to run that farm\u2019s 485-member CSA.\n\nBut after five seasons, Taylor grew tired of the 90-minute round-trip commute. With ideas on starting her own organic farm that she could bike to, she found a two-acre plot of unused land owned by the Oblates of Mary Immaculate, a Catholic order of missionaries.\n\nWithin D.C.\u2019s 68 square miles, small plots of land then were being cultivated to grow food to donate to low-income residents. There also were gardens set up to teach people how to grow vegetables. \u201cBut at that time in 2012, we didn\u2019t have a farm in D.C. that was dedicated solely to production,\u201d Taylor says.\n\nWhile the Oblates supported her mission, their attorney worried that leasing the land for a commercial farm could subject them to a property tax assessment. Passed down to Taylor, the bill could make it hard for her to get a farm up and growing.\n\n\u201cWe needed a lower property tax rate on land that was in agricultural use, which actually is a model that people have done all over the country since the \u201970s to save family farms,\u201d Taylor says.\n\nWhile hauling in compost to build up the farm\u2019s soil, Taylor simultaneously worked with Councilmember Grosso, students at a pro bono legal clinic, and food and farming advocates on \u201cI Want D.C. to Grow,\u201d a policy campaign designed to support her own goal as well as others interested in farming in the city.\n\nTheir efforts led to the passage of the D.C. Urban Farming and Food Security Act, which allows a 90 percent reduction in property taxes to owners of vacant lots who create partnerships with independent urban farmers. Known locally as the \u201cD.C. Farm Bill,\u201d the legislation allows property owners who are exempt from taxation to pass the exemption to the farmer. It also allows would-be growers to submit proposals for leases to cultivate unused public land.\n\nWhen the D.C. Farm Bill took effect in April 2015, Three Part Harmony became the first farm to benefit. Now, the policy is poised to clear a path for more urban farming in D.C. In 2020, the city\u2019s tax and revenue department will implement the abatement procedures for property owners, says Ona Balkus, food policy director at the D.C. Office of Planning. Balkus is excited about the potential more production farms on unused city property, and even on rooftops.\n\n\u201cOnce the urban farming tax abatement goes into effect, private properties will be eligible for the tax credit if they lease their land or their rooftops to urban farms,\u201d Balkus says. \u201cGiven the high price of land in D.C., rooftop farms on new real estate developments are a promising way to bring more fresh food to District residents.\u201d\n\nA year after requesting proposals, the city is expected to finalize five-year lease deals with two applicants this fall. Jeremy Brosowsky, who since 2010 has run a business that provides compost to urban farms, is one of those applicants. He credits the \u201cI Want D.C. to Grow\u201d campaign for making his idea possible.\n\n\u201cIf this program didn\u2019t exist, the farm couldn\u2019t exist,\u201d Brosowsky said. \u201cGail is an important advocate for the community and a talented and relentless urban farmer.\u201d\n\nOrganic Production in the City\n\nDuring the years she spent working on the D.C. Farm Bill, Taylor couldn\u2019t sell any of the vegetables she was growing on the Oblates\u2019 property. To earn start-up money, she built a greenhouse in her backyard and began supplying starter plants to local hardware stores and neighbors operating community gardens. She also launched a small, porch-style CSA, which she ran by growing vegetables in her backyard and in the backyards of friends and neighbors.\n\nTaylor watering plants the first year she did a backyard CSA by riding her bike around to three different plots each week. (Photo by Helina Chen.)\n\nHeading into its eighth season, Three Part Harmony offers pesticide-free vegetables, herbs, and cut flowers. Designed as an \u201cedible landscape,\u201d the cultivated rows on the farm\u2019s two-acre plot feature three-foot walkways to allow visitors to \u201cget up close with their food.\u201d Taylor\u2019s technique also includes the companion planting of crops that enhance each other\u2019s growth. She might plant a row of bunching onions and come in three weeks later with romaine lettuce.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re constantly putting in things that can share space together,\u201d Taylor says.\n\nTo add nutrients and organics to the soil and allow it to rest between plantings, Taylor also plants a third of the farm with oats, rye, and crimson clover as cover crops, or \u201cgreen manure.\u201d\n\nA Group Effort\n\nThree Part Harmony takes its name from her father\u2019s often-repeated description of the collaborations her family of musicians created together. Its organic growth is due to efforts of the community of friends and neighbors Taylor has cultivated who come together and do their part, she says.\n\nIn addition to volunteers who help with the harvest, some CSA members donate their front porches to Taylor to help with distribution.\n\nThey also help build the farm\u2019s online presence and offer professional bodywork to help Taylor and her two part-time farm hands recover after long days of planting and harvesting. A family member created the farm\u2019s logo, which pays homage to the Monarch butterfly and Taylor\u2019s family\u2019s path during the Great Migration.\n\nTaylor has enlisted nearby orchards and farms run by women and farmers of color to add variety\u2014products like fruit, cheese, honey, rice, herbal items, and eggs\u2014to her weekly CSA menu.\n\n\u201cTwo years ago, when we went from under 100 members to over 100, my staff and I went around to all of those farms and said, \u2018We want to scale up. This is what we need,\u2019\u201d recalls Taylor. \u201cThat was the first time [other farms] started setting aside some of their acreage and growing just for us.\u201d\n\nOne of those growers is Gale Livingstone, a former government IT contractor, who met Taylor at a conference for new farmers. They bonded over the novelty of being young African American women launching production farms. Livingstone began providing organic eggs and vegetables for Taylor\u2019s CSA.\n\nThis season Livingstone has relocated to a three-acre plot of land closer to D.C. \u201cMy long-term plan is that I\u2019m trying to buy some land in Maryland\u2014a much larger piece of land\u2014so that I can incorporate animals into my operation,\u201d Livingstone says. \u201cI\u2019m hoping to have Gail become an integral part of that\u2014she\u2019s super-organized and is great at managing people, which is one of the areas that I tend to need help with.\u201d\n\nA Deeper Connection\n\nIn addition to scaling up her CSA, Three Part Harmony has also donated food to soup kitchens and food pantries. Through her efforts at the farm and within the community, Taylor aims to build an operation that disrupts the historical racism and oppression upon which food systems have been operated, provide alternatives to corporate-based food production, and meet the community\u2019s needs on a deeper level.\n\n(Photo by Cassie Chew.)\n\nAs residents within cities like D.C. seek greater food options and policy makers look to urban farming and community supported agriculture to solve challenges such as malnutrition, health disparities, and disinvestment in urban communities, Taylor\u2019s work can serve as a model of urban farming that\u2019s innovative and member-driven.\n\n\u201cPeople are going out of their way to support this CSA. They\u2019re not saying, \u2018I paid this much and this is what I\u2019m getting out of it,\u2019\u201d Taylor says. \u201cA lot of people are saying \u2018I paid this much money, and I\u2019m supporting these Black women farmers.\u2019 We\u2019re two right now, but maybe one day there will be more.\u201d\n\nTop photo \u00a9 Lise Metzger.", "title": "The Woman Leading the Way for Urban Farming in the Nation\u2019s Capital", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "['not_sure']", "annot_city": "[]"}, {"id": 177, "city": "['Washington']", "url": "https://dc.curbed.com/2019/6/24/18715982/walkable-cities-urbanism-smart-growth-america-gwu", "text": "\u201cWashington, DC is a model for walkable urban development, particularly due to its balanced development of center city and urbanizing suburbs,\u201d argues a new report from the Center for Real Estate and Urban Analysis at George Washington University\u2019s business school. Released Monday, the report ranks current and projected levels of walkable urbanism in the 30 largest U.S. metro areas based on land-use data and other development metrics, like rent premiums.\n\nWalkable urban places feature high development density, lenient zoning rules, mixed uses, and multiple forms of transportation, according to the authors. A helpful rule of thumb for thinking about walkable areas is whether \u201cdestinations such as home, work, school, stores, and restaurants\u201d are within a half-mile or so of a specific point. The report describes \u201c761 regionally significant walkable urban places,\u201d or \u201cWalkUPs,\u201d in the 30 metro areas studied.\n\n\u201cThese WalkUPs occupy a minute portion of the total land mass of [those] areas (less than one percent), but deliver outsized economic performance,\u201d write authors Tracy Hadden Loh, Christopher B. Leinberger, and Jordan Chafetz. The report, titled \u201cFoot Traffic Ahead,\u201d was produced in partnership with real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield, nonprofit organization Smart Growth America/LOCUS, and research and data company Yardi Matrix, per a release.\n\nSign up for the Curbed DC Newsletter Email (required) By signing up, you agree to our Privacy Notice and European users agree to the data transfer policy. Subscribe\n\nThe D.C. region ranked fourth for walkable urbanism as of today, behind New York, Denver, and Boston. In both the Boston and D.C. metros, more than 40 percent of occupied WalkUP space is located in suburbs seeing development, the report says. Northern Virginia\u2019s Reston Town Center and Maryland\u2019s downtown Bethesda and Silver Spring are cited as examples of this pattern. \u201cEven Tysons in Northern Virginia, the prototypical \u2018Edge City\u2019 of the late 20th century, is urbanizing about 40 percent of its 2,400 acres, evolving into 4 to 5 WalkUPs, as a result of four new Metrorail stations opening in 2014\u201d\u2014for the Silver Line\u2014the report notes.\n\nThe authors make a key distinction between walkable urban and \u201cdrivable sub-urban\u201d areas:\n\n\u201cMany readers may be used to thinking of the land in metropolitan areas in the U.S. as divided into three categories: \u2018central city,\u2019 \u2018suburban,\u2019 and \u2018exurban.\u2019 However, emerging 21st century development patterns suggest that the exurban typology is less meaningful for where the economy focuses its location, and we need categories driven by measures of urban form and economic activity, rather than absolute or relative spatial location, to examine and understand contemporary and future metropolitan development in the United States. The more useful dichotomy to understand metropolitan America is \u2018walkable urban\u2019 and \u2018drivable sub-urban\u2019 development. Both types of development can occur in either a metro\u2019s central city or in a metro\u2019s suburban area.\u201d\n\nDrivable sub-urban areas are characterized by low density, homogenous building types, heavy motor-vehicle activity, and separated land uses.

The study, which was funded by the Greater Washington Partnership and JPMorgan Chase, also says 220,000 families who have annual incomes below $75,000 and are spread across 296 census tracts, may face displacement due to rising housing costs.\n\nThe numbers put a fine point on the region\u2019s affordable housing crisis as its economy stands to continue growing with the advent of Amazon\u2019s Northern Virginia headquarters and other employment opportunities. The researchers are calling for local governments to implement a slew of strategies to make housing more accessible to people of various incomes, including by preserving existing affordable housing and removing barriers to new development.

Among experts, that threshold is commonly defined as being \u201ccost-burdened\u201d by housing. The researchers say 40 percent of these additional units would have to be in the low-middle and middle housing cost bands, while another 38 percent would have to be in the lowest and low cost bands, to match the need. (The cost bands range from $0 to $799 per month to $3,500 or above per month.)\n\nMeanwhile, according to the Urban Institute, increasing home values and property taxes are placing greater pressure on families to leave the area. Beyond the 220,000 families who are most at risk of displacement, another 99,000 families also with incomes below $75,000 per year live in communities that are \u201cvulnerable\u201d to displacement.

Aided by a volunteer, he filled a basket with bananas, apples, corn and squash and paid with a health program voucher.\n\n\"It helps you out when you can't get to the store,\" Eleby said.\n\nIn Chicago, nonprofit groups have opened health clinics where staff provide patients with nutrition education and free coupons to area farmers markets replete with healthy foods. Both cities also have encouraged burgeoning efforts to plant urban gardens.\n\nLarge cities across the country are using this multipronged approach to bring healthy diets to \"food deserts,\" mostly low-income neighborhoods located miles away from the nearest supermarket. They hope not only to reduce rates of diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity, but to encourage community activism and empowerment.\n\n\"We're doing this out of ... responsibility toward our community,\" Safia Rashid said of the garden she and her husband, Kamau Rashid, have tended on Chicago's South Side for the past 14 years.\n\nThe 44-year-old mother said the couple began gardening when their oldest son was 3 years old, to fight \"'food apartheid' ... folks deliberately disinvesting in this community, removing healthy food away from us,\" Safia Rashid said.\n\nThe Rashids' garden grows at the South Chicago Farm, a 14-acre (5.6-hectare) site developed in 2015. It's one of eight such farms in Chicago operated by the nonprofit Urban Growers Collective.\n\nIn Atlanta, many of the tomatoes, peaches and peppers found in bins at the Fresh MARTA Markets come from food grown in the city and nearby farms, said Hilary King, of the nonprofit Community Farmers Markets, which partners with the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority to run the stands. Launched in 2015, the MARTA markets are located at different stations during the week.\n\n\"We cannot rely on traditional retail methods,\" said Atlanta urban agriculture director Mario Cambardella.\n\nNonprofits also have teamed up with ridesharing company Lyft to provide up to 300 low-income families with discounted rides to farmers markets and grocery stores in Atlanta. The six-month pilot program, called Access AgLanta, began June 1, inspired by a similar Lyft partnership in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"What we have often heard over the years is that transportation is a huge barrier to food access,\" said Alysa Moore, program manager for Georgia Fresh For Less, which provides state residents who receive food stamps with financial assistance to shop at farmers markets.\n\nEleby relies heavily on the transit platform markets. Without them, he said, he'd be forced to rely on a small scattering of stores in his low-income neighborhood in southwest Atlanta where he said he has to smell food or examine it for mold before buying it. The food there, he said, isn't \"like it's supposed to be.\"\n\nAs of 2015, roughly 22% of Atlanta's population was living in a low-income community more than a mile from a food store, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nIn Chicago, that number is 5%. Comparatively, the number in Seattle is 7.8%; Washington, D.C., 6.4%; Baltimore, 4.3%; and Milwaukee, 3.5%, according to the USDA.\n\nChristopher \"Mad Dog\" Thomas, 34, who grew up in the Altgeld Gardens neighborhood on Chicago's South Side, said he has suffered from \"'food desert eating disorder,' where all you can afford to eat is candy.\"\n\nThomas and his wife, Kathryn Gatewood, make a weekly trip outside their neighborhood to a store called Pete's Supermarket, which Kathryn Gatewood describes as \"the black or Hispanic Whole Foods.\"\n\n\"We spend almost 40% of our paychecks combined to ensure a healthier diet for our kids,\" she said, adding that it is a better alternative than buying bad food from the \"dusty shelves\" of corner stores in Englewood.\n\nThe Chicago nonprofit Inner-City Muslim Action Network has launched \"The Corner Store Campaign\" to change that.\n\nSami Defalla, who runs the Morgan Mini Mart in Englewood, has been an active partner with the campaign for more than two years. Defalla has created a \"green zone\" in the store where shoppers can purchase inexpensive fresh fruits and vegetables.\n\n\"I wish I had a bigger platform to offer more ... to my customers,\" Deffala said.\n\nThe Muslim Action Network also operates a health clinic where patients can see a dietitian free of charge and receive coupons for free produce at the nearby farmers market. Every Friday, the group hosts a farmers market where residents can connect with local urban farmers.\n\nAs a volunteer in a community garden in Atlanta, Celeste Lomax is finally able to take fresh produce home to her low-income neighborhood, which is located about 4 miles (6.4 kilometers) away from the nearest supermarket.\n\n\"We have a right to eat healthy like everyone else does,\" she said.\n\n___\n\nAlfiky reported from Chicago.", "title": "City Gardens, Public Produce Stands Ease 'Food Desert' Woes", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Atlanta']"}, {"id": 183, "city": "['Atlanta']", "url": "https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/atlantas-urban-design-storefront-brings-planning-to-the-people", "text": "On a weekday afternoon in southwest Atlanta, passersby round a street corner and walk by a windowed storefront. Perhaps they catch a glimpse inside of the aerial map of Atlanta, covered in sun-faded sticky notes. Or maybe they see people working and talking at desks.\n\nEither way, the City of Atlanta hopes these passersby open the door.\n\nAtlanta City Studio is a pop-up storefront meant to involve the public in the urban design process. Operated by the city\u2019s Department of City Planning, the pop-up invites anyone to walk in, talk with the city\u2019s urban designers and collaborate on ideas for projects. City staff are there to answer questions and give the public a way to get their ideas for improving their neighborhoods in front of the right people. Oh, and if you have a question about a broken water meter or a pothole, the studio can help you with that, too.\n\nAtlanta City Studio opened in 2016 at Ponce City Market, a repurposed historic building with a food hall and shopping. In 2017, the pop-up moved to its present location in Cascade Heights, a historically black neighborhood. The story of how Atlanta City Studio came to Cascade Heights highlights its public-facing nature. The Cascade Heights Community Development Corporation invited the city to tour the neighborhood, hoping to eventually revitalize the business corridor.\n\n\u201cWe knew that [the studio] would draw a lot of resources that we needed and it would also shine a light on the neighborhood,\u201d says Corliss Claire, secretary and founding member of the community development corporation. \u201cDevelopment is coming in this direction, but we want to make certain that we stay on top of it.\u201d\n\nCascade Heights is one of the last areas near downtown Atlanta that has swaths of available land for development. Claire, who has lived in Cascade Heights since 2002, says this is a critical moment to help guide future growth while preserving the neighborhood\u2019s character.\n\nSo in April 2017, the studio opened in Cascade Heights. It has six full-time staff members and one fellowship student.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve become an essential part of the community,\u201d Claire says.\n\nThe studio began by listening to residents and learning what they had already accomplished and what they wanted for the future. \u201cWe put their work on up the walls alongside city designs and tried to tease out what those projects were,\u201d says Kevin Bacon, director of Atlanta City Studio.\n\nSix months into its tenure there, the studio identified projects to work on in Cascade Heights. This has included making Beecher Street, a major connection, more walkable, and working with the community to design and build a custom bus shelter that has real-time bus signage and landscaped planters. Ideas came from the CDC and others in the community.\n\nThe studio brings its own expertise as well. CDC asked the studio to hold a session with business property owners about how to improve their storefronts, Claire says. It went beyond that. The studio ended up offering a matching grant program, giving eligible property owners up to $20,000 for facade improvements. By the time the program finished in summer 2018, five businesses had received the storefront redesign grant, and the city has launched a similar grant program in the West End neighborhood.\n\n(Photo courtesy Atlanta City Studio)\n\nIn addition to speaking with the public about design projects, the studio has recurring events every month to engage people: a book club, a lunchtime forum and a morning discussion over doughnuts. People and groups can also use the studio space for meetings.\n\nThe studio is not only a public-facing design arm. It also represents the city as a whole. A staff member is always on duty to answer any questions, even if they aren\u2019t design-related. \u201cIf this is your first touchpoint with city government, we want it to be a really good experience and point you in the right direction,\u201d says Sonia Sequeira, the studio\u2019s manager of community engagement.\n\nAtlanta City Studio\u2019s more than two years in Cascade Heights is coming to an end as it moves to another part of the city. Though some Cascade Heights projects have finished, others are still in progress. The studio worked on the design of the Beecher Street walkability project, and the next step is to find funding. It will continue its support of the project even after leaving the neighborhood.\n\nAnother project has envisioned how to bring additional housing to the business quarter. The studio has coached the CDC on how to promote this vision going forward.\n\n\u201cWe would never have been able to solidify our ideas and our visions for the future for the business quarter and also for the immediately surrounding neighborhood without the resources that the studio has,\u201d Claire says. \u201c[For] a government entity, I don\u2019t usually have these kinds of glowing praises.\u201d\n\nShe adds that a community of color is not one that normally gets this kind of attention.\n\nThe next stop for Atlanta City Studio is south downtown, where it will open in late summer. Among the most notable development coming is Centennial Yards, a 40-acre, mixed-use mini city within downtown.\n\nBacon says designers can play a role in shaping change coming to that area.\n\n\u201cWhen you look at south downtown, among a lot of the other places that you could make arguments for, everything that\u2019s about to happen right there just begs having us in the middle of it to be a shaping force.\u201d", "title": "Atlanta\u2019s Urban Design Storefront Brings Planning to the People", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Atlanta']"}, {"id": 184, "city": "['Atlanta']", "url": "https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/24/us/atlanta-food-forest-fighting-food-desert/index.html", "text": "(CNN) Among the heavily trafficked streets of Atlanta, a massive urban food forest is growing to provide fresh produce for the public.\n\nBut what exactly is a food forest?\n\nIn the fight against food deserts -- low income areas that lack access to fresh, whole foods -- a food forest is a public space in the city where fresh produce will grow in trees, bushes, plants, and community garden beds for the community to enjoy.\n\nAnd at 7.1 acres, the site in Atlanta will become the city's first and the nation's largest.\n\nIn the Lakewood-Browns Mill community, which will house the Urban Food Forest, more than a third of the population lives below the poverty line, according to the USDA , who has assisted in the project.\n\nRead More", "title": "This southern city is fighting food deserts with a forest of free produce", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Atlanta']"}, {"id": 185, "city": "['Atlanta']", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/14/magazine/traffic-atlanta-segregation.html", "text": "Atlanta has some of the worst traffic in the United States. Drivers there average two hours each week mired in gridlock, hung up at countless spots, from the constantly clogged Georgia 400 to a complicated cluster of overpasses at Tom Moreland Interchange, better known as \u201cSpaghetti Junction.\u201d The Downtown Connector \u2014 a 12-to-14-lane megahighway that in theory connects the city\u2019s north to its south \u2014 regularly has three-mile-long traffic jams that last four hours or more. Commuters might assume they\u2019re stuck there because some city planner made a mistake, but the heavy congestion actually stems from a great success. In Atlanta, as in dozens of cities across America, daily congestion is a direct consequence of a century-long effort to segregate the races.\n\nFor much of the nation\u2019s history, the campaign to keep African-Americans \u201cin their place\u201d socially and politically manifested itself in an effort to keep them quite literally in one place or another. Before the Civil War, white masters kept enslaved African-Americans close at hand to coerce their labor and guard against revolts. But with the abolition of slavery, the spatial relationship was reversed. Once they had no need to keep constant watch over African-Americans, whites wanted them out of sight. Civic planners pushed them into ghettos, and the segregation we know today became the rule.\n\nAt first the rule was overt, as Southern cities like Baltimore and Louisville enacted laws that mandated residential racial segregation. Such laws were eventually invalidated by the Supreme Court, but later measures achieved the same effect by more subtle means. During the New Deal, federal agencies like the Home Owners\u2019 Loan Corporation and the Federal Housing Administration encouraged redlining practices that explicitly marked minority neighborhoods as risky investments and therefore discouraged bank loans, mortgages and insurance there. Other policies simply targeted black communities for isolation and demolition. The postwar programs for urban renewal, for instance, destroyed black neighborhoods and displaced their residents with such regularity that African-Americans came to believe, in James Baldwin\u2019s memorable phrase, that \u201curban renewal means Negro removal.\u201d\n\nThis intertwined history of infrastructure and racial inequality extended into the 1950s and 1960s with the creation of the Interstate highway system. The federal government shouldered nine-tenths of the cost of the new Interstate highways, but local officials often had a say in selecting the path. As in most American cities in the decades after the Second World War, the new highways in Atlanta \u2014 local expressways at first, then Interstates \u2014 were steered along routes that bulldozed \u201cblighted\u201d neighborhoods that housed its poorest residents, almost always racial minorities. This was a common practice not just in Southern cities like Jacksonville, Miami, Nashville, New Orleans, Richmond and Tampa, but in countless metropolises across the country, including Chicago, Cincinnati, Denver, Detroit, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, Syracuse and Washington.\n\nWhile Interstates were regularly used to destroy black neighborhoods, they were also used to keep black and white neighborhoods apart. Today, major roads and highways serve as stark dividing lines between black and white sections in cities like Buffalo, Hartford, Kansas City, Milwaukee, Pittsburgh and St. Louis. In Atlanta, the intent to segregate was crystal clear. Interstate 20, the east-west corridor that connects with I-75 and I-85 in Atlanta\u2019s center, was deliberately plotted along a winding route in the late 1950s to serve, in the words of Mayor Bill Hartsfield, as \u201cthe boundary between the white and Negro communities\u201d on the west side of town. Black neighborhoods, he hoped, would be hemmed in on one side of the new expressway, while white neighborhoods on the other side of it would be protected. Racial residential patterns have long since changed, of course, but the awkward path of I-20 remains in place.\n\nA MARTA station under construction on the edge of downtown Atlanta, 1978. Charles Pugh/Atlanta Journal Constitution, via Associated Press\n\nBy razing impoverished areas downtown and segregating the races in the western section, Atlanta\u2019s leaders hoped to keep downtown and its surroundings a desirable locale for middle-class whites. Articulating a civic vision of racial peace and economic progress, Hartsfield bragged that Atlanta was the \u201cCity Too Busy to Hate.\u201d But the so-called urban renewal and the new Interstates only helped speed white flight from Atlanta. Over the 1960s, roughly 60,000 whites left the city, with many of them relocating in the suburbs along the northern rim. When another 100,000 whites left the city in the 1970s, it became a local joke that Atlanta had become \u201cThe City Too Busy Moving to Hate.\u201d\n\nAs the new suburbs ballooned in size, traffic along the poorly placed highways became worse and worse. The obvious solution was mass transit \u2014 buses, light rail and trains that would more efficiently link the suburbs and the city \u2014 but that, too, faced opposition, largely for racial reasons. The white suburbanites had purposefully left the problems of the central city behind and worried that mass transit would bring them back.\n\nAccordingly, suburbanites waged a sustained campaign against the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) from its inception. Residents of the nearly all-white Cobb County resoundingly rejected the system in a 1965 vote. In 1971, Gwinnett and Clayton Counties, which were then also overwhelmingly white, followed suit, voting down a proposal to join MARTA by nearly 4-1 margins, and keeping MARTA out became the default position of many local politicians. (Emmett Burton, a Cobb County commissioner, won praise for promising to \u201cstock the Chattahoochee with piranha\u201d if that were needed to keep MARTA away.) David Chesnut, the white chairman of MARTA, insisted in 1987 that suburban opposition to mass transit had been \u201c90 percent a racial issue.\u201d Because of that resistance, MARTA became a city-only service that did little to relieve commuter traffic. By the mid-1980s, white racists were joking that MARTA, with its heavily black ridership, stood for \u201cMoving Africans Rapidly Through Atlanta.\u201d\n\n[To get updates on The 1619 Project, and for more on race from The New York Times, sign up for our weekly Race/Related newsletter.]\n\nEven as the suburbs became more racially diverse, they remained opposed to MARTA. After Gwinnett voted the system down again in 1990, a former Republican legislator later marveled at the arguments given by opponents. \u201cThey will come up with 12 different ways of saying they are not racist in public,\u201d he told a reporter. \u201cBut you get them alone, behind a closed door, and you see this old blatant racism that we have had here for quite some time.\u201d\n\nAfrican-American and white passengers on an Atlanta Transit Company trolley on April 23, 1956, shortly after the outlawing of segregation on all public buses. Horace Cort, via Associated Press\n\nEarlier this year, Gwinnett County voted MARTA down for a third time. Proponents had hoped that changes in the county\u2019s racial composition, which was becoming less white, might make a difference. But the March initiative still failed by an eight-point margin. Officials discovered that some nonwhite suburbanites shared the isolationist instincts of earlier white suburbanites. One white property manager in her late 50s told a reporter that she voted against mass transit because it was used by poorer residents and immigrants, whom she called \u201cillegals.\u201d \u201cWhy should we pay for it?\u201d she asked. \u201cWhy subsidize people who can\u2019t manage their money and save up a dime to buy a car?\u201d\n\nIn the end, Atlanta\u2019s traffic is at a standstill because its attitude about transit is at a standstill, too. Fifty years after its Interstates were set down with an eye to segregation and its rapid-transit system was stunted by white flight, the city is still stalled in the past.", "title": "How Segregation Caused Your Traffic Jam", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Atlanta']"}, {"id": 186, "city": "['Atlanta']", "url": "https://saportareport.com/a-more-urban-atlanta-calls-for-shift-to-two-way-streets-and-e-scooters/", "text": "By Maria Saporta\n\nChange is hard.\n\nWe are witnessing that fact every day \u2013 whether it be turning one-way streets into two-way streets or whether it be introducing 10,000 e-scooters on our city\u2019s streets in the past year.\n\nIt all comes down to a simple fact. We are readjusting the way we are moving around in Atlanta. We are shifting from a car-oriented transportation network to one that includes multiple modes \u2013 pedestrians, cyclists, transit riders and users of the myriad of micro-mobility modes that have emerged on our streets, trails and sidewalks.\n\nBut not everyone is embracing the change \u2013 as we found out with the proposal to turn six blocks of Baker Street downtown from a one way corridor to a two-way street.\n\nAfter the legislation was approved by the Atlanta City Council in an 11-4 vote, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms surprisingly vetoed it.\n\n\u201cA lot of concerns have been raised,\u201d Mayor Bottoms said in a brief interview after the ribbon-cutting of the Atlanta BeltLine\u2019s Eastside Trail north of Memorial Drive. \u201cOut of an abundance of caution, I wanted to be sure we have addressed their concerns. We have an opportunity to take a step back, to give everyone the assurance that their concerns are being addressed.\u201d\n\nAsked if the two-way proposal was still on the table, the mayor answered without hesitation: \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d\n\nBottoms said the is continuing to get input from the those who would be impacted by making all of Baker Street two ways \u2013 the residents, the business community, including downtown hotels among others.\n\n\u201cIt is an opportunity to take a step back and make sure we have done our due diligence. We want to make this transition as safe as possible. There\u2019s never any harm in slowing this process down,\u201d said Bottoms, who added that she doesn\u2019t have \u201cover-arching concerns\u201d about the proposal.\n\nShe also said she had met with Tim Keane, the city\u2019s planning commissioner, to discuss her veto.\n\n\u201cTim Keane is a seasoned professional,\u201d Bottoms said. \u201cI trust his judgement.\u201d\n\nOne can attribute part of Atlanta\u2019s changing transportation habits to the BeltLine \u2013 trails that serve pedestrian, cyclists, skateboarders, skaters, e-scooters, e-bikes and other means of movement.\n\nAs an example of how the BeltLine has changed our psyche, Mayor Bottoms admitted at the ribbon-cutting that 10 years ago, she had heard about the BeltLine \u201cbut I probably couldn\u2019t tell you what it was.\u201d Now it has changed the profile of Atlanta.\n\nDowntown is not the only area changing its focus from cars to pedestrians.\n\nThe Midtown Alliance is planning to turn one-way thoroughfares into two-way streets. The Midtown Alliance has several plans to change the feel of one of the hottest real estate markets in the Atlanta region.\n\nKevin Green, president and CEO of the Midtown Alliance, recently revealed the results of an extensive survey of people who live and/or work in Midtown.\n\nOne interesting response was that \u201c94 percent agree that Midtown is no longer a place to go through,\u201d Green said. Instead it is a destination \u2013 a place to experience and enjoy. Green said there are 70 lane miles within the 1.2 square mile that makes up Midtown. Plans call for reducing only 8 percent of that space for alternative modes of transportation.\n\nThe survey revealed support for a shift in priorities.\n\nWhen asked about which modes of transportation should be a priority, 96 percent answered walking; 90 percent said transit; 79 percent said cycling; 42 percent said dockless scooters and the lowest priority was cars with 39 percent.\n\nScooters were non-existent in Atlanta before May 2018. Today there are about 10,000 scooters offered by 10 vendors. It\u2019s become a little bit like the wild, wild west on Atlanta\u2019s streets.\n\nBut at the monthly Sustainable Atlanta Roundtable event at Southface on July 12, there was consensus that the scooters are here to stay.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s better to have a 40-pound scooter than a two-ton car\u201d competing for space on our cities streets, said Shaun Green, senior transportation engineer for Atlanta BeltLine Inc. Green said that just one of the vendors \u2013 Lime \u2013 had one million rides in just one year; and he added that 37 percent of scooter rides are replacing a car trip.\n\n\u201cThe best part about scooters is that people are no longer as pissed off at bicycles,\u201d Green said jokingly.\n\nWhen it comes to scooters, the rules of the road and the sidewalk still need to be fine-tuned. Common courtesy goes a long way \u2013 no matter what mode of transportation one uses. And our streets need to be reconfigured to make them more welcoming to non-automobile modes of transportation.\n\nMy guess is that this micro-mobility revolution is in its infancy. As time goes on, my guess is that we will see different kinds of electric vehicles that would appeal to the over-50 demographic \u2013 seated scooters or even mini golf carts.\n\nThey all will play a part as we witness that transition from cars to a multimodal transportation system. Micro-mobility modes are becoming part of the \u201clast-mile solution\u201d \u2013 filling in the gaps that exist because of our limited transit network.\n\n\u201cHow can we build a region where it\u2019s easier and safer for everyone to walk and bike?\u201d asked Byron Rushing, bicycling and walking program manager for the Atlanta Regional Commission, during the Southface panel discussion. \u201cWe need to build better streets. If there are no facilities for people to walk or bike safely, people are not going to walk or bike.\u201d\n\nAn ARC study \u2013 \u201cWalk, Bike, Thrive\u201d \u2013 lays out the opportunities for the region. And it is not surprising that the change will begin in the city of Atlanta \u2013 where density and development is forcing a shift away from cars to alternative modes.\n\nSo it\u2019s only a matter of time before Baker Street and several of our other one-way thoroughfares become two-way streets that are more inviting to those on foot, on bicycles or scooters.

And 40 percent of the WalkUP space in the region is in its suburbs or in cities just beyond Boston.\n\n\u201cLike election results, it is possible to \u2018call\u2019 an end of sprawl in metropolitan Boston in office, retail, and rental multi-family housing...,\u201d according to the report. \u201cThe Boston metro serves as a likely harbinger of the new walkable urban development era in the U.S.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the Boston region is basically a national model for walkable urban real estate that is not single-family housing\u2014the report\u2019s research did not include anything related to that\u2014one other metros, such as New York and Washington, might soon follow it in largely eliminating car-dependent sprawl from its office, retail, and multifamily markets.\n\n\u201cThis analysis examines income-producing real estate, and does not include single-family housing, which is a primary driver of sprawling development,\u201d the report said. \u201cHowever, within these market-driven product types (office, retail, and rental multifamily), we observe that in metro Boston drivable suburban development may be reaching its end.\u201d\n\nHow has the region gotten to this point? The report, \u201c2019 Foot Traffic Ahead,\u201d posits a few theories.\n\nThere is a significant amount of \u201chistoric walkable urban (pre-1930s) neighborhoods to redevelop\u201d in Boston and Cambridge in particular.\n\nThe tech industry is driving much of the region\u2019s economy, and its workers and companies by and large want reliable transportation that doesn\u2019t revolve around privately owned cars (witness the recent call from Kendall Square business leaders for more funding for the T).\n\nThere is that \u201cextensive, though perpetually underfunded\u201d T, which makes non-vehicular transportation more possible.\n\nThe region has \u201cone of the highest levels of walkable urbanism in the suburbs, now including brownfield development (Cambridgeport) in addition to suburban town center redevelopment (Cambridge).\u201d\n\nFinally, there\u2019s a more amorphous reason that the report\u2019s authors just couldn\u2019t quite define but that many residents might identify with: \u201cPride of place, while hard to quantify, but Bostonians have remarkable pride in their city and metro area, even referring to it as the \u2018hub of the universe.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe prominence of walkability in Boston-area real estate, and the resultant decline if not death of sprawl in the region, is in keeping with a larger trend.\n\nTen of the 30 metro areas that the report tracked are gaining economic market share three times faster than their 2010 base market share. The last time there was so pronounced a shift, the report said, was in the 1980s\u2014when market share was going in the opposite direction, toward suburbs that workers, shoppers, and residents had to drive to, and away from urban areas.\n\nThe report also found that for-sale homes in WalkUps in the top 30 metros sell at a\u200b 90 percent premium and rentals lease at a 46 percent premium compared with their counterparts outside of WalkUps in the metros\u2019 overall markets.\n\nAltogether, it\u2019s a shift toward the urban and away from the suburban in work-life that could have profound effects on the U.S. economy.\n\n\u201cThis trend suggests substantial future demand for additional WalkUPs in all metropolitan areas, especially within the urbanizing suburbs,\u201d Christopher B. Leinberger, chairman of the Center for Real Estate and Urban Analysis and co-author of the report, said in a statement. \u201cThis demand for new WalkUPs, along with the growth of existing WalkUPs, puts a new foundation under the U.S. economy, similar to that resulting from the building of drivable suburbs in the mid- to late 20t\u200bh\u200b century.\u201d", "title": "Sprawl is over in the Boston area, report says", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Boston']"}, {"id": 188, "city": "['Boston']", "url": "https://bostonrealestatetimes.com/boston-mayor-walsh-announces-design-of-city-hall-plaza-renovation/", "text": "BOSTON \u2013 Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh announced the renovation concept design of Boston City Hall Plaza. The renovation will transform the Plaza into a civic space for all residents, with universal accessibility, new civic spaces for all to use, increased environmental sustainability, and critical infrastructure improvements that will ensure the Plaza is safe and accessible for all for generations to come.\n\n\u201cBoston\u2019s City Hall Plaza is a space visited by thousands of Boston residents each and every day,\u201d said Mayor Walsh. \u201cThis renovation will turn our seven-acre space into a welcoming, accessible space for all, featuring new civic spaces for events to areas for families to enjoy together. Creating a new People\u2019s Plaza will help us achieve our goals of making one of Boston\u2019s most-used public spaces better for all residents.\u201d\n\nThe seven-acre plaza is one of the City\u2019s largest civic spaces and for the last 50 years it has hosted events ranging from sports celebrations and rallies, to seasonal cultural festivals. The Plaza\u2019s sustainable and forward-thinking renovation will bring Boston\u2019s City Hall Plaza up to 21st-century standards, and create a Plaza that is welcoming and accessible for all residents and visitors. The Plaza design is created by Sasaki, a global design firm specializing in urban design.\n\nPhase 1 of the project will deliver updated civic spaces and programming capabilities, as well as add infrastructure that will make the Plaza more sustainable, including connecting Congress and Cambridge Streets with an accessible sloped Promenade activated by 21st century civic amenities like shady seating and gathering areas, a destination play space, public art space and an iconic water feature.\n\nCity Hall Plaza\u2019s redesign includes a focus on:\n\nA Welcoming Front Yard for Civic Life\n\nWith Boston\u2019s renovated City Hall Plaza, this community space will become universally accessible for residents of all abilities. Opening up the Plaza for all will include re-opening the second floor of City Hall Plaza to the public, allowing easier access to the building. This public-facing entrance was closed in 2001, and will open again under the new renovation plan.\n\nThe renovation also includes 3,000 new welcoming spaces for residents to sit, 12,000 square feet of playscapes for children and families, and 11,000 square feet of terraces for pop-up play and interactive public art.\n\nFlexible and Accommodating Event Venues\n\nBoston City Hall Plaza renovation will right-size one of Boston\u2019s largest event spaces, and create civic event spaces that can be used by all Boston residents. The renovation includes creating seven new \u201cplug and play\u201d locations for community groups to utilize, with space for 10,000 \u2013 12,0000 visitors on the main Plaza, and room for a 20,000 \u2013 25,000 person gathering on the entire Plaza.\n\nThe new design will also include three smaller event and gathering places, and a new civic building on Congress Street, equipped with a bathroom and other facilities to support public gatherings.\n\nA Model of Sustainability and Resilience\n\nCreating a sustainable City Hall Plaza that meets the City\u2019s environmental goals is one of the key parts of the Plaza renovation, and this renovation will make City Hall Plaza one of Boston\u2019s signature civic spaces environmentally sustainable, meeting Boston\u2019s resilience standards.\n\nThe renovation includes an increase in permeable surfaces that will soak up stormwater, planning ahead for severe weather in downtown Boston. The design also includes 100 new trees, improving the shade, scale and air quality of the Plaza. Fifty lights will be replaced with efficient LED technology, and 22,500 feet of granite and brick paving will be reused or recycled.\n\nAs part of the master planning process beginning in early 2015, Mayor Walsh engaged the community through dozens of public meetings and across social media to help crowdsource ideas on how to reimagine the Plaza. As the project has proceeded it has engaged, and will continue to engage, many stakeholders and impacted abutters and neighbors, including the MBTA and the U.S. General Services Administration, which concurrently has been masterplanning their own modern-era structures and neighboring and sites.\n\nFunding for Phase 1 of the Plaza is included in Boston\u2019s Capital Budget, announced earlier this year. Of this budget, $70 million in total project costs is designated to complete Phase 1 of the Boston City Hall Plaza renovation.\n\nThe $2.78 billion FY20-24 Capital Plan is how the City makes critical investments in the City\u2019s capital assets, including schools, roads, bridges, bike lanes, libraries, and more. This year\u2019s plan includes renewed public housing in Charlestown, revitalized parks in Dorchester, transportation improvements in Allston-Brighton, school improvements across the city, and fulfills Mayor Walsh\u2019s commitment to dedicating over 10 percent of new city funding toward climate resilient projects. This plan ensures the municipal, civic and open space assets that residents cherish in their neighborhoods will remain active and vibrant parts of the community for years to come.\n\nThe Plaza design and implementation is led by global design firm Sasaki. The project is managed through the City\u2019s Operations Cabinet by the Public Facilities Department in partnership with the Property Management Department and is assisted by owners project manager Skanska USA.\n\n\u201cBoston City Hall Plaza has long been Boston\u2019s place to gather, celebrate and make residents\u2019 voices heard,\u201d said Isabel Zempel, Sasaki landscape principal. \u201cThis historic Plaza recently celebrated its 50th anniversary and these updates will bring the Plaza into the modern century with improved infrastructure, sustainability, and public spaces. The Plaza\u2019s renovation will honor its original intentions and history, while making it a more accessible place for all.\u201d\n\nThe current renovation project builds off the foundations of the Boston City Hall and Plaza Master Planning Study: Rethink City Hall. Released by Mayor Walsh in October 2017, the study was led by the City\u2019s Public Facilities Department and design teams of Utile and Reed Hilderbrand. The study resulted in a 30-year master plan to address required repairs and to transform the 50-year-old City Hall and Plaza into an innovative, healthy, efficient and civic facility designed to better serve current and future generations of Bostonians and visitors.\n\nOver 600 residents visit Boston City Hall on a daily basis, while 19,500 residents live within a half-mile of the Plaza, in addition to its 18 million annual tourist visitors. This renovation supports Mayor Walsh\u2019s commitment to investing in civic spaces throughout Boston, and creating a City Hall that is accessible for all residents.\n\nPrevious work by the City to enhance the Plaza include seasonal events like The Patios: presented by Berkshire Bank along with the Boston Garden Development Corp., which reopened on Thursday, May 2 and Boston\u2019s free summer lunch program for students on the Plaza, or Boston\u2019s now-annual summer \u201clawn\u201d popup piloted in partnership with the Mayor\u2019s Office of New Urban Mechanics.\n\nMore information about the City Hall Plaza renovation is available on boston.gov. A public community meeting will be held at Boston City Hall Plaza on Wednesday, June 5th at 6:00 p.m. for a design presentation and discussion about the Plaza renovation.\n\nAbout Boston Public Facilities\n\nPart of the City of Boston\u2019s Operations Cabinet, the Public Facilities Department supports all City departments in their efforts to improve customer services to Boston\u2019s constituencies. The Public Facilities Department oversees all major projects at City-owned buildings and is responsible for managing the programming, planning, design and construction for new buildings and major renovations across all neighborhoods in Boston..\n\nFor over sixty years, Sasaki has brought together the best of landscape architecture, planning, urban design, architecture, interior design, civil engineering, graphic design, place branding, and data science to shape the places in which we live.

Adjacent cities, like Cambridge and Somerville, are well connected by transit and contain dense housing options, near shops and amenities, that people want to live in. Looking at the Boston metro area, Loh says, provides a window into what could be the landscape of America in the future: networks of dense, urbanized communities built out around core cities, and connected by non-car transit options like light rail, buses, and bike infrastructure.\n\nThis trend is not just limited to Boston. A new report from GWU and Smart Growth America (Loh is a co-author) finds that on the whole, America is falling out of love with the suburbs. It\u2019s not the location of these places that is the issue, Loh and her co-authors find, but rather their design: sprawling communities of single-family homes that require a car to navigate are not what\u2019s drawing people anymore. What\u2019s popular now are places where people can live in mixed-use, multifamily housing\u2014maybe an apartment building above a coffee shop\u2014and walk, bike, or take transit to get around.\n\nFoot Traffic Ahead: Ranking Walkable Urbanism in America\u2019s Largest Metros counts 761 such communities throughout the 30 biggest metro areas in the U.S. In total, these mixed-use, walkable areas comprise less than 1% of the total land mass in the metro areas, but they delivery disproportionately significant economic benefits. While sprawling, suburban districts have added no new development and in some cases, lost occupancy since 2010, nearly all new office and multifamily housing construction has clustered in these 761 areas. In today\u2019s \u201cknowledge economy,\u201d companies are finding they benefit from clustering near each other and in the midst of a strong labor pool\u2014which they\u2019ll find in the dense, walkable communities that younger and well-educated workers are increasingly seeking out.\n\nA well-documented negative effect of this trend is high real estate prices. But, according to Loh, that\u2019s only creating significant problems in the U.S. because wages for ordinary workers have stayed stagnant for decades, making it difficult for them to keep pace with housing costs, and because many cities have not met the growing demand for housing in walkable communities with adequate new construction. Yet even in places like New York and San Francisco where housing costs are high for these reasons, residents often save on transportation costs because it\u2019s not necessary to have a car to get around.\n\nBeyond raising wages for workers so they can afford to live where they work, Loh says that metro areas need to take concerted steps to support this trend toward walkable, urban communities. One lever, she says, is doing away with single-family zoning, which prohibits building mixed-use and multifamily developments. That\u2019s already happening in some places: Minneapolis and the whole state of Oregon have recently banned single-family zoning. Another is rolling back requirements in many places that developers must add more parking to go along with new housing or commercial structures.", "title": "America has fallen out of love with the suburbs", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Boston']"}, {"id": 190, "city": "['Boston']", "url": "https://rebusinessonline.com/demand-for-retail-space-surges-in-boston/", "text": "Demand for Retail Space Surges in Boston\n\nBoston\u2019s urban core is seeing a healthy volume of new development, such as Arsenal Yards, a mixed-use project in Watertown that will ultimately feature 250,000 square feet of retail space. But with healthy demand from new retailers and restaurants, the market appears to be balanced.\n\nBolstered by strong growth in its millennial population and high-paying jobs, Boston\u2019s urban core continues to boast one of the lowest retail vacancy rates in the country.\n\nBut this trend has also led to a wave of new development that could temper that good news for Boston retail owners.\n\nAccording to data from Marcus & Millichap, metro Boston\u2019s retail vacancy rate is expected to rise by 40 basis points from 3.2 percent to 3.6 percent in 2019, a year in which 1.3 million square feet of new projects are slated for completion.\n\nBy comparison, the national vacancy rate stood at 10.2 percent at the end of the first quarter, reports Reis. Marcus & Millichap predicts that the uptick in metro Boston\u2019s retail vacancy will slow the pace of annual rent growth to 3.3 percent.\n\nPopulation growth is fueling demand for housing, which in turn spurs demand for retail to serve those new residents. Metro Boston\u2019s population has grown by more than 112,000 people over the last five years, according to Marcus & Millichap, and the area boasts a median household income in excess of $90,000.\n\nWhile the local rate of population growth mirrors that of the United States as a whole, average household income is nearly 33 percent higher in Boston than in the rest of the country. In addition, the market added 23,560 new jobs during the 12-month period that ended March 31. That figure represents a decline from the previous 12-month period, but a healthy indicator nonetheless given that the bulk of those jobs were in the business and professional services sector.\n\nIn markets where the population is growing, retail developers and operators often look to the suburbs for new spaces and customers. But Boston\u2019s urban core is experiencing inward migration, due not only to the aforementioned job and population growth, but also to the presence of vibrant new destinations.\n\nAs such, retail real estate professionals see little cause for concern in terms of oversupply. They expect key retail categories like food, fitness and entertainment to continue to drive positive absorption, particularly in submarkets located within the 128 loop.\n\nMixed-Use Projects Abound\n\nSimilar to the United States as a whole, the Boston retail market is over-retailed in the big box segment. But much like other primary markets, well-located properties with authentic, creditworthy tenants continue to perform well and attract strong demand from investors.\n\nIn addition, redevelopment projects that feature a mix of uses have brought elevated demand for retail space to growing submarkets. Such projects include Arsenal Yards, a mall redevelopment project in Watertown, and the Seaport District, located near South Boston.\n\nAt the same time, neighborhoods like Somerville and Brighton, which have traditionally been strong retail markets anchored by nearby college populations, are also seeing retail development within mixed-use settings. Assembly Row in Somerville offers several entertainment destinations \u2014 an AMC theater, Legoland and Lucky Strike Social \u2014 in addition to boutique dining and shopping options. In Brighton, the new Boston Landing development, which houses the world headquarters and flagship store of New Balance, is also seeing its retail and dining components come on line.\n\n\u201cThe densification of Boston\u2019s urban core is happening with high-rise residential and office projects,\u201d says Manny Steiner, vice president of leasing at New England Development, a firm known locally for projects like CambridgeSide, which fronts the Charles River in East Cambridge and Chestnut Hill Square in Chestnut Hill. \u201cWith those projects, retail is often required by government authorities, and many developers see that component as an amenity that sets the tone for the rest of the building.\u201d\n\nSteiner also says that taking a mixed-use approach to retail development will be integral to balancing future supply in Boston\u2019s suburbs, where much of the existing product is pure-play retail space. Big boxes and single-tenant properties have been hit by both slacking absorption and investor demand in the age of online shopping.\n\n\u201cThe needs of retail in today\u2019s urban core are more pedestrian, modest and transit-oriented than they were in the past,\u201d says Steiner. \u201cToday\u2019s consumers want convenience above all else and are approaching retail from an omni-channel perspective. Much of the older retail space in the suburbs will need to be repurposed or reinvented.\u201d\n\nCorey Bialow, president and CEO of full-service brokerage firm Bialow Real Estate, notes that the emergence of new destinations is prompting retailers and restaurants that are new to the area to rethink their site selection strategies. This holds true in both neighborhoods that have high densities of retail space and which have always been hotbeds of pedestrian traffic, as well as in submarkets that lack those qualities.\n\nIn many cases, first-to-market concepts that have historically gone to neighborhoods close to downtown, like Fenway-Kenmore or Back Bay, are considering other submarkets that are experiencing population growth but which are more affordable.\n\n\u201cHistorically, Boston has been a very difficult market for new tenants to enter. This is due in part to a large supply of older buildings, properties that carry restrictions that often limit landlords\u2019 ability to meet the needs of tenants,\u201d says Bialow. \u201cBut new projects have many modern amenities, such as larger floor plates, upgraded mechanical systems and parking garages that traditional retail hotbeds like Newbury Street can\u2019t offer.\u201d\n\nFighting E-Commerce\n\nThe steady growth among Boston\u2019s internet-resistant retail categories has been a defining point of this cycle. Boutique fitness concepts that focus on specific workout routines, as well as quick-service restaurants that offer healthy menu options, are among the new users beefing up their footprints in the state capital.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing many e-commerce brands realize that having a physical presence is important to building their brand and forming a better connection to their customers,\u201d says Bialow. \u201cThis has helped backfill many of the voids created by traditional brick-and-mortar retailers closing their stores, though the city of Boston has fared much better than the suburbs in terms of [minimizing] closures.\u201d\n\nCompanies that built their brands with e-commerce are also drawn to brick-and-mortar locations in Boston due to the metro\u2019s demographic advantages, including a growing cohort of millennials. According to a recent report by the Boston Chamber of Commerce, more than a third of the city\u2019s population was classified as millennials, persons roughly between the ages of 20 and 34.\n\nAnd with more than 30 colleges and universities located throughout the Boston metro area, the market has a high proportion of millennials that have college degrees \u2014 almost 60 percent, according to recent data. These demographic traits make Boston an appealing market for companies seeking young talent, which in turn is drawn to workplace settings with strong retail and restaurant amenities.\n\nKenneth Fries, vice president of leasing, development and acquisitions at Needham, Mass.-based RK Centers, also cites grocery-anchored product as one of the market\u2019s strongest-performing sectors. Established grocers like Wegmans, Whole Foods Market and Market Basket are among the users that have expanded their store counts during this cycle, unlocking additional value in the underlying real estate in the process.\n\n\u201cThe draw of legacy grocers allows developers to charge rents that are higher than current market rates for ancillary, small-shop spaces,\u201d says Fries. \u201cBut for smaller grocers that are faced with operating stores with declining sales, it often makes more sense to work with the landlord to permit and redevelop the land for a high-density residential use.\u201d\n\nWhile some small-shop spaces in more affluent neighborhoods command above-market rents, there is a shortage of affordable small-shop space across the market as a whole. According to Fries, this is one of the biggest concerns currently facing the Boston retail market, as it creates a major barrier to entry for up-and-coming retail concepts that lack the credit or capital to take space in a prime Boston location.\n\n\u201cThe lack of availability of affordable small-shop space for budding new retail concepts is a problem,\u201d says Fries. \u201cIt\u2019s not a new problem, but in the past it always seemed like there were incubator locations for cool new tenants.\u201d\n\nIn addition to hurting merchandisers, the dearth of quality retail space that won\u2019t break the bank is also problematic for new restaurant users. These users, if not backed by a larger operating group, often have higher costs of occupancy \u2014 mainly in the form of tenant improvements \u2014 and take longer to turn a profit.\n\nThe market is experiencing ample demand for space from both nationally branded and chef-driven concepts. But restaurants that want to develop their own spaces face high construction costs and property taxes, and some users that are looking for turnkey spaces are being priced out by the market\u2019s strong pace of rent growth.\n\nThe suburban markets of Eastern Massachusetts are also seeing absorption from certain national tenants, some of which have backfilled big box vacancies. According to a report from KeyPoint Partners, a full-service firm with offices throughout the region, Hobby Lobby led the way in terms of large-format store openings, recently adding two new locations in Braintree and Attleboro. Target has opened three new stores in Burlington, Medford and Cambridge; and At Home is opening a second regional store in Dedham.\n\nSmaller-format retailers that have also boosted their presence in metro Boston include Xfinity (nine new stores), Verizon Wireless (seven new stores) and Richfield Convenience Express (seven new stores). According to KeyPoint Partners, this activity has brought the vacancy rate for all of Eastern Massachusetts, which has a market inventory of about 196 million square feet, to 9.4 percent.\n\nInvestment Outlook\n\nSimilar to retailers adjusting their sales and marketing strategies to adapt to e-commerce, landlords are retooling their tenant rosters to promote cross-shopping, longer visit times and socialization and recreation within their centers.\n\nRetail investors are already drawn to Boston\u2019s demographic and economic fundamentals. As retailers and developers continue to make the aforementioned changes, the confidence of retail investors in the operating strategies of these groups is coming back. This is perhaps best captured by a slight uptick in recent investment activity from institutional capital sources, the activity of which has largely been confined to shedding non-core assets over the last several years.\n\nBased on property and portfolio sales of $2.5 million and above, private investors accounted for about 47 percent of all retail acquisitions in the Boston market during the first quarter of 2019 on a trailing 12-month basis, according to Real Capital Analytics (RCA) and CoStar Group. Publicly traded REITs comprised just 3.7 percent of buying activity, while equity funds and other sources of institutional capital accounted for 12 percent of purchases.\n\n\u201cHaving in-house operating, development and leasing resources allows us to get granular in our valuation,\u201d says Shelley Anderson, managing director at KPR Centers. \u201cBeing able to cite key tenant relationships in the underwriting and due diligence phases gives confidence in a successful transaction.\u201d\n\nInvestors in Boston and beyond still face hurdles, however, such as accurately analyzing online sales data to determine a store\u2019s overall health or finding value-add opportunities that aren\u2019t overly capital-intensive. But according to Anderson, capital sources are still allocating funds for retail deals. Combined with Boston\u2019s strong retail fundamentals \u2014 population growth, residential development and traffic counts \u2014 this mandate has elevated the competition among buyers in the marketplace.\n\n\u201cCompetition continues to be tight within the [State Route] 128 and [Interstate] 495 rings, where demographics are especially robust,\u201d says Anderson. \u201cHowever, redevelopment costs incurred and rent adjustments are causing a shift in how we underwrite and evaluate risk for retail investments.\u201d\n\nLandlords are also being aggressive when it comes to pursuing tenant renewals and extensions, she adds. \u201cAs landlords seek to fill vacancies and fight for the new and thriving tenants, maintaining lease term and strong co-tenancy will distinguish winners from losers on residual sales of assets.\u201d\n\nThe influx of millennials and high-paying jobs aside, Boston\u2019s retail investment market also benefits from high barriers to entry, says Bob Horvath, executive vice president at Horvath & Tremblay, which specializes in net-lease and multi-tenant retail deals.\n\n\u201cBoston is still a desirable market for investors due to the complexity of zoning in New England, which serves as a barrier to entry for new development,\u201d he says. \u201cIn addition, cap rates in this area tend to hold fairly steady relative to other parts of the country. The capital flow is sticky and tends to stay in New England, as local investors tend to focus on local assets.\u201d\n\nAccording to CoStar and RCA, as of the first quarter of 2019, the average cap rate for multi-tenant retail assets in the Boston area was about 6.5 percent. Single-tenant properties tended to trade at an average cap rate of 7.3 percent. The average sales prices for these asset classes clocked in at $322 per square foot and $374 per square foot, respectively.\n\nAcross the board, however, investors are paying close attention to the term and credit of tenants, as well as the residual risk component \u2014 whether the rent is replaceable with a new tenant or if it\u2019s significantly above or below the market rate.\n\n\u201cThe market on a national level is a little softer in terms of cap rates, and there\u2019s been some upward movement on certain assets,\u201d says Horvath. \u201cBut much of that is driven by macroeconomic factors \u2014 interest rates, uncertainty in the larger economy. This is still a top market with excellent fundamentals: population, income, traffic counts \u2014 all the things you look for in retail, Boston has them.\u201d\n\n\u2014 By Taylor Williams.

For instance: Windsor Locks, in Connecticut, has had 18 such days this month, the most there in any month on record. Most climate sites are experiencing one of \u2014 if not the \u2014 warmest Julys on record. It doesn\u2019t matter which climate site you review, this is a top 10 warm month pretty much everywhere in the Northeast:\n\nMany climate sites are experiencing a top-5 warm month this year. (Screenshot courtesy of the Southeast Regional Climate Center)\n\nWhen you hear \"warmest July,\" what meteorologists mean is that the average between the day and the night ends up higher than any other month. Records for Boston go back to 1872, so when you have the warmest July on record it's significant.\n\nStatistics can be funny because you can look at a variable all sorts of ways. For example, while this month will end up as Boston's warmest average July on record, it will be slightly off from warmest daily high temperatures \u2014 likely the third-warmest. And the number of 90-degree days will not exceed the record, which was 15 back in 1994:\n\nAs of Monday, there were 10 days at 90 or above this July. (Screenshot courtesy of NOAA)\n\nThe nights have been incredibly warm. Part of the reason the nights have been so tropical is due to something called the urban heat island effect. This keeps cities like Boston warmer than the surrounding countryside. All the concrete and other building materials radiate the heat absorbed during the day and keep cities warmer at night. Both daytime and nighttime temperatures have been on the rise over the past several decades, but the nights have been outpacing the rate of change, partially because of all the building that's going on in Boston.\n\nThis is true for any urban environment. Scientists agree the changing climate is due mostly to human influence from things like CO2, but the urban heat island effect has a part, as does natural variability, just not as much.\n\nJuly has had humidity, but not excessively higher-than-average. I put together a chart that shows the number of hours we've spent at different dew point levels. The green box indicates the most humid hours. Notice there's been more hours than average with the highest (70 and over) dew points.\n\nThe number of hours with high dew points has been above average in July. (NOAA)\n\nEarlier this month a few places actually had dew points nearing 80 degrees, which is about as high as you will ever see in the Northeast. Although this was extreme, it didn't last.\n\nNot only is this July the warmest July on record, it's also the warmest month ever recorded here in Boston. Of course with temperatures around the globe rising, it shouldn't be any surprise we're seeing more and more monthly and yearly records for high temperatures. June was the warmest June for the entire globe and we've seen heat records broken from the United Kingdom down into Central Europe.\n\n(Courtesy of NOAA)\n\nYou perhaps heard about all the heat in Europe earlier this month. This included a record high of 38.7 degrees Celsius in England. That's over 101.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Incredible.\n\nThe Arctic continues to experience high rates of melting as well. If we look at the rate of summer melt since 2015, you will see that this year is lower than any of those years and on pace to perhaps break the record set back in 2012. All of this should be of no surprise to anyone. Global climate models have been predicting this warming for decades.\n\nThe rate of arctic ice melt this summer is flirting with a new record. (Courtesy of the National Snow and Ice Data Center)\n\nSince climatologists have been looking at the rate of warming for so long, we are now able to compare what's happening with what the models predict. A decade ago there was 10 years' less data; now with more data available, we can see the global climate models are doing a good job of predicting what we are observing.\n\nTake a look at the chart below, which shows how actual temperatures have been, compared with computer models' predictions. The lines aren't going to be perfect, nor would we expect them to be. In the same way that the computer models I used to forecast today weather's aren't going to exactly predict what's going to happen, it's the same for climate models, but they are both pretty good at their respective jobs. Short-term models are good for forecasting weather within 10 days, the climate models are good at forecasting the climate years in advance.\n\n(Courtesy of Carbon Brief)\n\nFuture months may or may not break records, but that doesn't mean that the climate isn't warming. There is no doubt that warmer records are going to outpace cooler ones in the coming years and we should expect more summer heat that lasts long and is more intense. We may start even getting used to an additional 90-degree day, or two or three, but in the coming decades the numbers of heat waves and tropical nights are likely to be on the rise and in an increasingly big way.", "title": "Boston Sweats Through Its Hottest July On Record", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Boston']"}, {"id": 192, "city": "['Seattle']", "url": "https://www.kuow.org/stories/mmiw-in-seattle-tears-flow-as-city-commits-to-supporting-native-americans-93df", "text": "\u201cReclaiming the inherent responsibility of the City to protect its most vulnerable populations.\u201d\n\nThose are the first words in a resolution passed by the Seattle City Council on Monday that aims to support Native American communities \u2014 especially the crisis involving missing or murdered indigenous women and girls.\n\nCouncilmember Debora Juarez, a member of the Blackfeet Nation, listed what\u2019s in the measure:\n\n\u201cNumber one, we decolonize the data by improving data collection and reporting methods.

In the end, the resolution that passed is mostly in line with the goals pushed forth by environmental group Seattle for a Green New Deal, which is run largely by Got Green and 350 Seattle.\n\nCouncilmember Kshama Sawant called the resolution \u201cnecessarily ambitious,\u201d referring to its goal to dramatically push Seattle forward in its climate and equity initiatives.\n\n\u201cThis is a very strong resolution with which to base our future fight on,\u201d Sawant said. \u201cThere\u2019s no other way to achieve this.\u201d\n\nThe resolution, which was finalized hours before the council meeting, is inspired by the Green New Deal introduced by progressive leaders in Congress earlier this year. While that resolution has stalled, some municipalities, including New York and Los Angeles, have moved forward with their own versions. The resolution that the Seattle City Council passed details a broad range of green initiatives, including the promotion of free public transportation, elimination of carbon pollutants and adoption of renewables. The council first showed support of a resolution in June when advocates asked council members to sign a pledge committing to a citywide Green New Deal.\n\nLavanya Madhusudan, assistant to Councilmember Mike O\u2019Brien, said while the resolution is nonbinding, it does set the stage for future action in the city.\n\n\u201cThe resolution is the first step,\u201d Madhusudan said by email before the vote. \u201cBy laying out a vision for what we are working towards, it sets the stage for future legislation to act to make this vision a reality.\u201d\n\nThe resolution states that while the city has made some steps towards the goals listed within it, \u201cthat progress is insufficient to make the necessary changes to shift Seattle\u2019s economy to be more equitable and ecologically sustainable.\u201d The resolution suggests that financing of these actions be taken with \u201cprogressive revenue sources\u201d and public funds.\n\nWhile Seattle\u2019s Green New Deal mentions carbon-cutting efforts the city already is pursuing, it calls for them to be pushed further. Mayor Jenny Durkan\u2019s 2018 Climate Action Strategy aims for carbon neutrality by 2050, for example, while the resolution seeks to create a new goal of carbon neutrality by 2030. Madhusudan says that by expediting these actions, the resolution wants \u201cto create action to redouble our efforts to meet the urgency of the climate crisis.\u201d\n\nInitially, advocates of Seattle\u2019s Green New Deal were interested in creating an ordinance that would have been proposed alongside this resolution in order to ensure follow-up action. While no concurrent ordinance was proposed, Madhusudan says that it has been discussed in committee, and an ordinance to create a Green New Deal Oversight Board will be reviewed and revised over the next few weeks. At this point, she expects that it will be brought to a vote in early September.\n\nFor now, advocates say that the resolution is a solid beginning. King County Councilmember Larry Gossett, who spoke during the city council\u2019s public comment period, also expressed an interest in introducing a Green New Deal resolution at the county level: \u201cIt\u2019ll be a great foundation for me to pick it up and spread it.\u201d\n\nThe resolution comes as Seattle is on the brink of electing a new council. After the general election in November, at least four council seats will have new occupants. O\u2019Brien, who has worked with advocates to bring the resolution to council for weeks and is lead sponsor of the resolution, will not be returning. He encouraged new council members to push the Green New Deal and address the global climate crisis in his absence.\n\n\u201cA resolution alone is not going to solve it,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cWe have a lot of work to do going forward.\u201d", "title": "Council promises Seattle its own Green New Deal", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Seattle']"}, {"id": 194, "city": "['Seattle']", "url": "https://insideclimatenews.org/news/13082019/seattle-city-green-new-deal-heating-oil-tax-free-public-transit-congestion-pricing-resolution", "text": "City leaders launched Seattle on the path to a Green New Deal this week, passing a resolution that starts laying out an ambitious plan for how the city can cut its greenhouse gas emissions in ways that protect the climate and improve the lives of its residents.\n\nIt's a nonbinding resolution, and like the national Green New Deal manifesto that's being promoted by Democrats in Congress, presidential hopefuls and the young activists in the Sunrise Movement, it's still mostly aspirational.\n\nBut it begins to sketch out a roadmap for Seattle's future as the city tries to both adapt to climate change and cut emissions in line with what the world's scientists say is needed.\n\nThe resolution envisions free public transit, a limit on new fossil fuel construction, 100 percent electric vehicles for ride sharing, and an infrastructure plan that takes sea level rise into account, among other ideas.\n\nThe big question confronting city officials and environmentalists now is how to begin implementing\u2014and paying for\u2014many of these initiatives. There are hints within the resolution, which mentions a congestion pricing plan to support low-income transit, using proceeds from a soda tax to promote healthy foods, and developing \"green zones\" to provide financing in neighborhoods that have historically borne the brunt of pollution.\n\nSign up for InsideClimate News Weekly Our stories. Your inbox. Every weekend.\n\nSome climate activists see Seattle's measure as the first step toward moving from symbolic gestures to specific goals and potential ways to implement them.\n\n\"It lays out the goals and timeline and ways to get there,\" said Alec Connon, an organizer with the environmental advocacy group 350 Seattle. \"No policies have changed, but it is a clear statement of intent from Seattle leaders that they're understanding the sheer severity and urgency of the climate emergency.\"\n\nThe move by Seattle highlights how local and state governments are setting ambitious targets to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in the absence of federal action, particularly at a time when scientific warnings are becoming increasingly urgent and the Trump administration is backing out of federal efforts aimed at curbing climate change.\n\nThis spring, Washington became the fifth state or territory\u2014following Hawaii, California, New Mexico and Puerto Rico\u2014to pass legislation committing to 100 percent clean electricity by 2045. Other states, including New York, have adopted aggressive policies to meet goals set by the Paris climate agreement, which the Trump administration abandoned in 2017.\n\n\"Climate change is one of the gravest threats we face, and the solutions to climate change must also be solutions that address income inequality and racial inequity,\" Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan said in a statement after the City Council unanimously passed the resolution Monday. \"While they debate the Green New Deal in the other Washington, we must continue to do more in Seattle.\"\n\nTranslating Goals Into Policy\n\nWhile a nonbinding resolution can set out goals, the city will have to find ways to translate those goals into actual policy to make a difference.\n\n\"The bigger story is, 'Does Seattle take that next step?' Whether that's developing a tax or finding ways to earmark funding and go deeper into the implementation process,\" said Barry Rabe, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.\n\nWhen asked if the city of Seattle had any specific plans on how it would fund the goals in the resolution, Jessica Finn Coven, the city's director of the Office of Sustainability and Environment said, \"the answer is yes and no.\"\n\nLast week, Durkan proposed a tax on home heating oil to help as many as 18,000 Seattle homes transition from oil to some form of cleaner energy. So, when it comes to funding the specific goal of transitioning away from using oil to heat homes, there is a specific mechanism on the table, Finn Coven said.\n\nFor the broader proposals in the resolution, she said, city lawmakers are researching their options and working with constituents and community leaders to determine how to move forward.\n\n\"Climate change is one of the gravest threats we face and the solutions to climate change must also be solutions that address income inequality and racial inequity,\u201d Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan said. \"While they debate the Green New Deal in the other Washington, we must continue to do more in Seattle.\u201d\n\nConnon said he hopes to see policies soon now that the resolution has passed, and he believes there are promising funding options available to help the city pay for some of the initiatives laid out in the measure, such as congestion pricing and implementing new taxes.\n\nAs an example of one viable option used in another city, Connon points to a move by Portland, Oregon, where voters last November passed a measure that imposes a tax on large retailers to help pay for the city's clean energy efforts.\n\nAnother way Seattle could pay for its green goals would be a levy, Connon said. Earlier this spring, nearly 70 percent of Seattle voters backed a $2.2 billion education levy.\n\n\"There's no reason the city couldn't do a Green New Deal levy to help kick this off,\" he said.\n\n'Cities Continue to Push the Needle'\n\nSeattle is one of a handful of U.S. cities that have mitigation goals for urban heat islands, have adopted or advocated for stringent building energy codes and have set targets for energy efficient transportation plans that take into mind low-income communities, according to a report released last month by the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE).\n\nWhen it comes to reducing energy use and trying to spur renewable energy, \"cities continue to push the needle,\" said David Ribeiro, senior research manager at ACEEE.\n\nThe ACEEE report found that 75 large U.S. cities had taken more than 200 actions on renewable energy and energy efficiency. Seattle ranked No. 3 in the report, behind San Francisco and Boston.\n\n\"In the case of Seattle, they are a city that's already leading on clean energy,\" Ribeiro said. \"They have aggressive goals; they have aggressive policies; they have good planning processes.\"\n\nRibeiro said it's hard to know whether Seattle's Green New Deal resolution will push more cities to follow suit. Los Angeles recently released a \"Green New Deal\" sustainability plan focused heavily on energy efficiency and renewable energy.\n\n\"I think it's all a matter of the interest of the residents and business owners in that city,\" Ribeiro said.\n\nPublished Aug. 14, 2019", "title": "What Would a City-Level Green New Deal Look Like?

Councilmember Abel Pacheco celebrates his birthday with a festive Lime scooter ride at City Hall. pic.twitter.com/X7sV1rvJQM \u2014 GeekWire (@geekwire) May 9, 2019\n\nCouncilmember Abel Pacheco not only came to work on his birthday, but he rode a scooter decorated with colorful balloons for the occasion.\n\nCouncilmember Lorena Gonz\u00e1lez took off from one side of the plaza to the other and her giddy laughter could be heard as she sped away. She addressed the rise in injuries in cities where scooters have already arrived.\n\n\u201cI think we have a really strong culture in Seattle of people who ride bikes already, so I have often times seen people just traveling with their bike helmet,\u201d Gonz\u00e1lez said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be an education process for us to make sure people understand how to safely use both bikes and scooters as they continue to be deployed throughout the city of Seattle. I think people in Seattle are very smart and very educated and they\u2019re going to understand their own limitations and what they need to do to protect themselves.\u201d\n\nGlen Buhlmann used to work for Microsoft, and he gave up his car when he moved into Seattle from the Eastside. On the back of his left leg, he was sporting a tattoo of a person on a bicycle dumping a small car into a recycling bin.\n\n\u201cI have memberships with everything \u2026 bike shares, all three of the car shares, and I already had the Bird membership waiting for them to come,\u201d Buhlmann said, adding that he thinks people were ready for a scooter program in Seattle a year ago. He said he believes the only valid criticism of bike and scooter-share programs is that the city doesn\u2019t build enough safe places to use and park them.\n\nBuhlmann figures he would mix scooters into his current transportation routine \u2014 \u201cI\u2019ll just use whatever\u2019s closest,\u201d he said. And when it comes to helmets, he doesn\u2019t use them \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m not against helmets, I\u2019m against helmet laws.\u201d\n\nAnna Zivarts is the program director of Rooted in Rights, a video advocacy program that is part of Disability Rights Washington.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t seen the city figure it out yet with bike share,\u201d Zivarts said about the prospect of scooters getting in the way of those who face challenges with accessibility. \u201cWe\u2019re excited about the health benefits, the mobility benefits. It\u2019s great that scooters are coming, we wan\u2019t people to get out of cars and have more options. But we\u2019ve got to figure out the parking.\u201d\n\nZivarts, who was currently working on a video with the Seattle Department of Transportation on proper bike-share parking, said it\u2019s not fair to ask the disability community, people whose mobility is already challenged, to bear the brunt of mis-parked bikes and scooters.\n\n\u201cOff-sidewalk parking would be great,\u201d Zivarts said. \u201cWe have streets, we can decide how we allocate that space. Let\u2019s allocate some of the parking space that goes to cars right now to bike shares and scooters.\u201d\n\nAfter some Council members took their test rides they returned to City Hall for a Sustainability and Transportation Committee lunch-and-learn session in which Portland-area officials presented findings from that city\u2019s scooter pilot program.\n\nThe report sheds a lot of light on how scooters were received and used by the public in 2018 and what issues have raised concerns, including a lot of what Seattle hopes to address before even getting started such as safe spaces to ride, dedicated parking and equitable access.\n\nTyler VanBrocklin is studying informatics at the University of Washington and he\u2019s an avid rider of LimeBikes as well as the company\u2019s LimePod car sharing. He first rode scooters during a trip to Los Angeles with friends a couple months ago and the things were everywhere in Venice Beach.\n\nHe still has his own car but has slowly stopped using it.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t really need a car in a city like this that now has so many different options,\u201d VanBrocklin said.\n\nDaniel Babadzhanob is working on his own healthcare startup and he was one of the first on the scene at City Hall as Lime and Bird workers were setting up the scooters. He previously tried Lime scooters in Washington, D.C., when he was there for a conference.\n\n\u201cThere were these scooters around and my friend and I decided to use it and try it out for the day,\u201d he said. \u201cWe had just an unbelievable time. Just super awesome.\u201d\n\nHis advice for the Council?\n\n\u201cDo it for sure,\u201d Babadzhanob said. \u201cIt just offers another option for people to get to work and get to places and brings a new experience to Seattle.\u201d\n\nCouncilmember O\u2019Brien is among those who are listening.\n\n\u201cIn a world where we have a lot of congestion, we have air pollution, these are the types of solutions we need and we need to do it right,\u201d O\u2019Brien said, adding that, in the case of bike sharing, \u201cSeattle often is one of the first cities to do things when it comes to transportation.\n\n\u201cAt the moment we\u2019re one of the last, but that\u2019s OK. We\u2019ve learned from a lot of other cities. We can design a program that hopefully will be the best in the nation.\u201d", "title": "City Council members join public in scooter test rides as Seattle looks to add transportation option", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Seattle']"}, {"id": 196, "city": "['Seattle']", "url": "https://www.geekwire.com/2019/uber-lyft-drivers-roll-seattle-city-hall-demand-better-wages-worker-protections/", "text": "A caravan of Uber and Lyft drivers arrived at the steps of Seattle City Hall on Thursday afternoon to demand better wages and treatment from the ride-hailing companies.\n\nThe rolling demonstration comes three weeks after drivers around the world held protests timed with Uber\u2019s initial public offering. In both cases, the drivers involved said they are frustrated by the companies\u2019 take rates and opaque methods of calculating rates. The drivers are also asking for a fair process to appeal deactivations on the apps.\n\nIt also comes on the same day Uber posted its first quarterly earnings report as a public company, revealing revenue of $3.1 billion and losses of $1 billion for the first quarter of 2019.\n\nHuge caravans of Uber drivers are rallying around Capitol Hill.

Some claim that the protesters are just a vocal minority advocating on behalf of the incumbent taxi industry and stymieing innovation. This conflict is playing out in cities everywhere as drivers and lawmakers struggle to define this new form of work enabled by apps. But the struggle is especially acute in Seattle, the first city to pass a law that would allow Uber drivers to unionize if it ever makes it out of lawsuits delaying its implementation.\n\nIn some ways, drivers are on the frontlines of a proxy war between Uber and Teamsters 117, a union in Washington state representing warehouse workers, truck drivers, taxi drivers, and others. The Teamsters were involved in the crafting of Seattle\u2019s collective bargaining ordinance. Teamsters affiliate the App-Based Drivers Association organized the caravan protest Thursday.\n\nIn Uber\u2019s court is Drive Forward, a group of drivers organized by the company. Drive Forward Director Matthew Wald said the protesters are \u201cthe same small group of disgruntled former taxi drivers who have fought against rideshare in Seattle for years,\u201d in a statement.\n\n\u201cThe fact is that drivers do make a living wage and enjoy the freedom and flexibility to make money on their own terms as independent business owners,\u201d Wald said. \u201cThe claims made by the App-Based Drivers Association are misleading and don\u2019t represent the views of the vast majority of rideshare drivers.\u201d\n\nThe driver caravan started in Seattle\u2019s Central District and ended at City Hall, where they delivered a set of demands to city officials and a report that found Uber and Lyft have a median take rate of 31 percent in Seattle, based on their analysis of 560 trips. That\u2019s up from Uber and Lyft\u2019s take rate in previous years. Drive Forward disputes the findings of the report.\n\nThe drivers were greeted by Seattle City Councilmembers Teresa Mosqueda, Kshama Sawant, Lisa Herbold, and Mike O\u2019Brien outside City Hall.\n\nDespite #Uber and #Lyft making billions of dollars, drivers still need to make a living wage.

But there is a growing body of research that suggests the opposite is taking place. The latest study, published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances, underscores how Uber and Lyft are worsening traffic in the city that gave birth to the ride-sharing phenomenon.\n\nSan Francisco, home base to both Uber and Lyft, is experiencing some of its worst traffic in years \u2014 research firm INRIX ranks it the eighth most congested city in the US \u2014 and much of it is due to the rising popularity of transportation network companies (TNC, an industry term used to describe ride-hailing apps like Uber and Lyft). How bad is it? According to today\u2019s study, between 2010 and 2016 traffic congestion in San Francisco increased by about 60 percent \u2014 and Uber and Lyft are responsible for more than half of that increase.\n\nUber and Lyft are responsible for more than half of the increase in vehicle delays\n\nThe study began when the San Francisco County Transportation Authority (SFCTA) reached out to Gregory Erhardt, associate professor for civil engineering at the University of Kentucky and an expert in transportation models and travel forecasting, to help determine the impact of ride-sharing on the city\u2019s traffic patterns. (The authority previewed the findings of the study in its own report released in October last year.)\n\nErhardt said the goal was to present a \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d picture of San Francisco\u2019s streets \u2014 before Uber and Lyft became popular in 2010, and after they became a dominate mode of transportation in 2016. To start out, they used a standard transportation simulation to control for variables, such as population growth, changes to the city\u2019s transportation system, and a rise in freight and deliveries.\n\nA big challenge going into this project was access to data. Uber and Lyft are sitting on troves of really interesting data on the movement of cars and people, but they are generally reluctant to share it with governments or academic researchers out of privacy concerns and for fear of compromising their competitive advantage. As a result, the research into the effect on congestion has been a mixed bag: some studies conclude that TNCs reduce congestion, while others note they increase vehicle miles traveled (VMT). Still others fail to reach any conclusion at all \u2014 and most researchers cite the lack of data as a prime obstacle.\n\nA big challenge going into this project was access to data\n\nErhardt and Joe Castiglione, the deputy director for technology, data, and analysis at SFCTA, reached out to some data scientists at Northeastern University who had put together a computer program that queries the API (application programing interface) for both Uber and Lyft, and reports the location of the 10 closest vehicles in both apps.\n\n\u201cAnd what they were able to do is set up sort of a grid of client calls to the API across San Francisco for a six month period in late 2016,\u201d Erhardt told The Verge. \u201cEvery two seconds, they say, \u2018Hey, where are the 10 closest vehicles, write that to a database. And we ended up with about 17 terabytes worth of data. But what you get out of it are these traces of where the vehicles are, where the drivers are, and when they\u2019re available for a ride.\u201d\n\nErhardt\u2019s team used a panel regression model to determine the change in travel time during this period, and what they found surprised them: far from alleviating traffic, Uber and Lyft are actually the \u201cbiggest contributor[s]\u201d to San Francisco\u2019s worsening traffic congestion.\n\nSpecifically, they found that the difference in travel times in congested conditions versus travel times in a free-flowing scenario \u2014 which they characterize as \u201cvehicle hours of delay\u201d \u2014 increased by 62 percent. Average speeds in San Francisco decreased by 13 percent in the time period. By contrast, in a simulated model that removes Uber and Lyft from the equation, weekday vehicle hours of delay increased by only 22 percent and average speeds decreased by 4 percent in the city.\n\nAverage speeds in San Francisco decreased by 13 percent in the time period\n\n\u201cThere has been this narrative about how [Uber and Lyft] have the potential to support transit, bringing people to and from transit stations, they have a potential to enable carpooling, and they have some potential to reduce people\u2019s auto ownership,\u201d Erhardt told The Verge. \u201cAnd those things are true to a degree. But the question is whether they\u2019re true enough to offset the ways in which TNCs increased congestion. And we find that when you look at the data, that\u2019s not the case.\u201d\n\nErhardt\u2019s team isn\u2019t the first to look at the effect Uber and Lyft have had on traffic in big cities. Probably the most widely cited study was done by Bruce Schaller, a transit consultant who served as deputy commissioner for traffic and planning in New York City. Last summer, he released a report called \u201cThe New Automobility,\u201d in which he concluded that ride-hail companies like Uber and Lyft have added 5.7 billion miles of driving annually in cities like Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, DC.\n\nErhardt said his research differs from Schaller\u2019s in so far as it \u201czoomed in\u201d on a specific city during a specific period time, and examined the effect of Uber and Lyft on traffic congestion. \u201cTo be able to look at this in two different ways, and find similar results, is really important and really encouraging,\u201d he added.\n\nLast week, the Sierra Club launched an ad campaign urging Uber and Lyft to curb air pollution by switching to fully electric cars. The environmental group is hoping to leverage Uber\u2019s impending IPO to highlight the ride-hail companies\u2019 contribution to climate change and rising carbon emissions.\n\nTo be sure, Uber and Lyft have weathered criticism about pollution and traffic congestion for years. And the company has tried to address it through a variety of means, including its bike- and scooter-sharing services, its effort to integrate public transportation scheduling and ticketing into its app, and its incentive program to get drivers to switch to electric cars. Uber also supported New York City\u2019s recent push for congestion pricing.\n\nspokespersons for both Uber and Lyft sent similar-sounding statements\n\nAsked for a comment on the study, spokespersons for both Uber and Lyft sent similar-sounding statements touting their support for \u201ccomprehensive congestion pricing,\u201d improved bike and scooter infrastructure, carpooling, and support for public transportation. They also both tried to cast doubt on the study\u2019s findings. Uber said that \u201cstudies disagree on causes for congestion,\u201d while Lyft notes that Erhardt\u2019s study \u201coverlooks notable contributors to congestion including increased freight and commercial deliveries, and tourism growth.\u201d\n\nErhardt said he hopes his study will serve as a wake-up call to city planners, who have the power to enact change that can help reduce the congestion. \u201cIf I\u2019m riding in an Uber or Lyft, it\u2019s pretty convenient, it\u2019s reasonably cheap, I get door to door service,\u201d he said. \u201cHowever, there\u2019s an externality, there\u2019s an effect on other people on the road. Me being in a car, I\u2019m causing congestion for other people. And the same thing happens if I\u2019m driving my personal car as well. And so what city planners and city officials need to do is somehow balance that out, balance out the benefits of the person in the car, with the cost to everyone else.\u201d", "title": "Uber and Lyft are the \u2018biggest contributors\u2019 to San Francisco\u2019s traffic congestion, study says", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['San Francisco']"}, {"id": 201, "city": "['San Francisco']", "url": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jul/01/san-francisco-big-tech-workers-industry", "text": "San Franciscans have long complained that tech workers ruined their city, driving up rents and homelessness and eliminating diversity.

The 29-year-old tech worker had just passed the Uber building when, without warning, a homeless man jumped into the bike lane with his dog, blocking her path.\n\nShe slammed on the brakes, flew four feet into the air and landed on the pavement, bleeding. \u201cIt was one of those hardening moments where I was like, \u2018Even I am being affected,\u2019\u201d she recalled.\n\nIt should be noted that Zoe, who asked not to be identified by her real name because she was not authorized by her employer to speak to the press, is not the stereotypical tech bro who moves to San Francisco for a job and immediately starts complaining about the city\u2019s dire homelessness crisis. She arrived in 2007 to study at San Francisco State University and had a career in the arts before attending a coding bootcamp and landing a job at a major tech company.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Many gentrified neighborhoods are renamed, like the East Cut, pictured, formerly known by local residents as part of SoMa in downtown San Francisco.\n\nBut the fall and other incidents, including getting mugged and having her phone stolen, have all contributed to her growing sense of insecurity in the area.

But what happens when the victors realize they don\u2019t particularly like the spoils?\n\nTech workers are increasingly vocal about their discontent with the city they fought so hard to conquer. In May, the median market rent for a one-bedroom apartment reached an all-time high of $3,700 a month, according to the rental site Zumper. Meanwhile, the city saw a 17% increase in its homeless population between 2017 and 2019, and residents complain of visible drug usage, fear of crime and dirty streets. Even Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce and a San Francisco native who has long urged comity between the techies and the city, has taken to calling his hometown a \u201ctrain wreck\u201d.\n\nFor Zoe, the newfound financial security from working in tech does not counterbalance a constant sense of being unsafe in the city. She now earns three to four times more than when she was a \u201cstarving artist\u201d, but she says she is terrified to walk at night. She no longer rides scooters and says she feels \u201ctriggered\u201d when she sees them around the city. She takes Ubers everywhere after dark and asks drivers to watch to make sure she gets inside her apartment building.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A homeless man picks up a syringe on Mission Street. Median rent for a one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco reached $3,700 a month in May.\n\n\u201cMark Zuckerberg lives nearby, but our corner is the main prostitution corner in the city,\u201d she said of the Mission District apartment she shares with her boyfriend. \u201cThere\u2019s condoms and syringes. It\u2019s absolutely crazy with how much we pay for rent \u2026 It\u2019s tough, because we work in tech, but we ask ourselves every day if we should move.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a striking contrast from just five years ago, when tech workers showed up in force at San Francisco City Hall to declare their love and respect for a city that was not exactly loving them back. \u201cI am so proud to live in San Francisco and be a part of this community,\u201d Google employees were instructed to say, as a preface to their remarks at a January 2014 hearing before the local transportation authority, according to a leaked company memo.\n\nI feel like San Francisco is between Seattle and New York, but rather than the best of both, it\u2019s the worst of both\n\nThat hearing was one of several pivotal moments in recent San Francisco history when public officials could have used the city\u2019s legislative or regulatory powers to force the tech industry to contribute more to public services, but chose not to. Such inflection points (which also include a controversial 2011 tax break for Twitter and a failed attempt at a \u201ctech tax\u201d in 2016) highlight the complicated relationship between the city government and an industry that has brought untold wealth and jobs, but has arguably failed to pay its fair share \u2013 while treating the city as a petri dish for disruptive innovations (think Uber, Airbnb and self-driving cars) by ignoring regulations.\n\nThe nominal issue in 2014 was the use of public bus stops by private charter shuttles (AKA \u201cGoogle buses\u201d) hired by tech companies to ferry employees the 45 miles south to their Silicon Valley headquarters. Activists wanted the double-decker buses banned from the streets and the companies fined for the illegal use of bus stops; the city chose to legalize the buses.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Workers near Google\u2019s San Francisco offices catch a bus headed to Mountain View, home of the company\u2019s main campus.\n\nThe Google Bus controversy was particularly charged because it tapped into local residents\u2019 deep concern that San Francisco \u2013 a city with the population of Jacksonville, Florida, and the self-importance of New York \u2013 would be reduced to a bedroom community for Silicon Valley. But while the buses continue to ply their routes north and south, that particular nightmare scenario hasn\u2019t come to pass. Instead, San Francisco has become more of a satellite campus, with South Bay stalwarts including Apple, Facebook, Google and LinkedIn competing for office space in the city proper. They\u2019ve joined the San Francisco-native companies Twitter, Uber, and Airbnb in the cramped confines of a city of just 49 square miles, surrounded by water on three sides.\n\nSure, you get people from all over the world, but the only ones who can move here now come from the same socio-economic class\n\nThe consequences of that squeeze are well documented: the outrageous housing costs, the displacement of black and Latino families, evictions, homelessness, the loss of beloved businesses and cultural institutions. The tale of how tech destroyed the city that gave us the Summer of Love has been told so many times that in 2014, the San Francisco Chronicle produced a satirical cheat sheet for out-of-town reporters parachuting in for taste of avocado toast and class warfare. (Amid a bumper crop of new elegies to San Francisco in recent months, web publication HmmDaily updated the form with an \u201cAI Algorithm-generated\u201d version.)\n\nBut what\u2019s striking about the current winter of our discontent (yes, it\u2019s July; consider this your obligatory Mark Twain reference) is that it\u2019s not just the archetypal \u201cevicted Mission District visual artist\u201d complaining that techies ruined San Francisco: it\u2019s the techies themselves, too.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A public space on the ground floor of the LinkedIn office.\n\nThe arguments against San Francisco are manifold: it\u2019s too expensive even for people making six-figure salaries, it\u2019s dangerous and depressingly unequal, and, increasingly, it\u2019s kind of boring. A frequent refrain among the more than a dozen tech workers who spoke to the Guardian for this article was that it is not so much the presence of have-nots that is ruining their experience of San Francisco, but an overabundance of haves.\n\n\u201cThe housing crisis has a huge negative impact on quality of life because of who it excludes from living near you,\u201d said Simon Willison, a software developer who moved to San Francisco from London five years ago. \u201cWhen I visit other cities I\u2019m always jealous of their income diversity: that people who have jobs that don\u2019t provide a six-digit salary can afford to live and work and be happy.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no future for anyone under 40 in this city who\u2019s not rich\n\n\u201cEven though people think there is diversity in the city, there isn\u2019t really,\u201d said Adrianna Tan, a senior product manager at a tech startup who moved to San Francisco from Singapore. \u201cSure, you get people from all over the world, but the only ones who can move here now come from the same socio-economic class.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel like San Francisco is between Seattle and New York, but rather than the best of both, it\u2019s the worst of both,\u201d said Beth, a 24-year-old product manager who asked not to be identified by her real name. Beth moved to the city directly after graduating from Stanford to work at a major tech company, but recently transferred to Seattle. \u201cEveryone I met was only interested in their jobs, and their jobs weren\u2019t very interesting,\u201d she said of her time in San Francisco. \u201cI get it, you\u2019re a developer for Uber, I\u2019ve met a million of you.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A man holds a sign as people watch a Democratic candidate debate in the Mission District.\n\nOne aspect of that homogeneity is that when everyone around you is either rich or destitute, being rich doesn\u2019t feel that rich.\n\n\u201cUnless you\u2019re here to hit the IPO jackpot, you\u2019ll always be middle-class,\u201d said Chris, a former Apple manager who recently decided to leave San Francisco for Texas and spoke on condition of anonymity. \u201cTech salaries allow you to get by for now, but there\u2019s no future for anyone under 40 in this city who\u2019s not rich.\u201d\n\nChris and his partner\u2019s combined annual income places them comfortably in the top 1% of earners in the US \u2013 but not in San Francisco, which recently achieved the dubious distinction of having the most billionaires per capita in the world. He said that the \u201ccost/benefit perspective\u201d on San Francisco was no longer working for him.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just not sustainable for a couple to live here,\u201d he said. \u201cA million-plus for a home with $300,000 down? Then when we have kids, $30,000 a year for private school? Who can afford that even making $300,000 a year? \u2026 There\u2019s hundreds of other places in the country with the same restaurant culture or at least on par that cost half as much.\u201d\n\nChris also complained about the \u201cproperty crime, unchecked homeless and drug issues\u201d plaguing the city, noting that he had recently witnessed a man smoking crack cocaine in broad daylight in the middle of the famously twisty Lombard street. \u201cYou don\u2019t see people smoking crack brazenly in public on Melrose in LA or in Times Square, NYC, but here the cops just shrug.\u201d\n\nThe haves and have-nots: four cities in crisis Read more\n\nFiguring out how to exist in a city with so much human misery clearly on display is another challenge for affluent tech workers, many of whom express compassion for the poor and homeless, as well as frustration with the city\u2019s decades of failure in providing adequate shelter and services to the homeless and mentally ill.\n\n\u201cIt was really hard to stomach the indifference that I witnessed from folks who\u2019d been living in San Francisco for a while, simply stepping over the slumped bodies of people who lived outside or just cold ignoring people asking for money,\u201d said Jessica Jin, who moved to San Francisco from Austin, Texas, to work for a tech startup, of her first impressions of the city. \u201cI wondered how long it would take me to also become numb to it all.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A man rides by a homeless encampment on Howard Street. Photograph: Jason Henry/The Guardian\n\nBadrul Farooqi, a startup worker, said that he had been surprised to experience echoes of the constant fear of crime and violence he was exposed to growing up in Detroit while living in San Francisco. \u201cThe entire purpose of going to school and working hard was to escape this kind of environment,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd while Farooqi acknowledged that San Francisco was much better off than the Detroit of his childhood, he argued that in some ways it was worse because the misery seems so unnecessary. \u201cSan Francisco is not Detroit,\u201d he said. \u201cDetroit was always poor \u2026 San Francisco has money!

In his opinion, it\u2019s the one bright spot in a city where taxes are too high.\n\n\u201cWe used to have a disaster here. I used to call the city all the time to come and clean, because they don\u2019t know where to go,\u201d he said, recalling one woman in particular who shrugged at him in a \u201cwhat can you do?\u201d gesture as she squatted to pee.\n\nSan Francisco started its \u201cPit Stop\u201d program in July 2014 with public toilets in the city\u2019s homeless-heavy Tenderloin, after children complained of dodging human waste on their way to school. Today, the staffed bathrooms have grown from three to 25 locations, and the program has expanded to Los Angeles. In May, the toilets in San Francisco recorded nearly 50,000 flushes, all logged by attendants.\n\nThe condition of San Francisco\u2019s streets has been a source of embarrassment to city leaders, and cleaning up is not cheap. The city received nearly 27,000 requests for feces removal in the most recent fiscal year, although not all are human.\n\nMayor London Breed last year announced the formation of a special six-person \u201cpoop patrol\u201d team where each cleaner earns more than $70,000 a year.\n\nAdvocates say steam cleaning requests have dropped in areas surrounding some of the public toilets. The mayor signed a budget Thursday that includes money for seven new Pit Stop bathrooms for a city where a one-night count of homeless people grew 17% in the past two years. The toilets each cost an average of $200,000 a year to operate, with most of the money going to staffing and overhead.\n\nSome of the bathrooms are permanent fixtures, while others are portables with two toilets that are trucked in and out. The stops have receptacles for used syringes and dog waste. Attendants who are paid the city\u2019s minimum wage of $16 an hour check after every use and knock on doors to make sure people are not doing drugs or other illicit activity. The bathrooms must shine or they do not open.\n\nThe staffing is what makes a toilet a Pit Stop, and the work is usually done by men coming out of prison after decades behind bars.\n\nThe \u201cpractitioners\u201d stand guard at some of society\u2019s bleakest intersections of poverty, addiction and mental illness, says Lena Miller, founder of nonprofit Hunters Point Family and its spinoff, Urban Alchemy, which staffs the Pit Stops in San Francisco and Los Angeles. They prevent overdoses, break up fights and greet regulars, she says.\n\n\u201cReally what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re creating this space where people know that they can walk into it, and it\u2019s going to smell good. It\u2019s going to look good,\u201d Miller said. \u201cThere won\u2019t be trash everywhere, and they\u2019re safe. And I think that makes all the difference in the world.\u201d\n\nNelson Butler was a 19-year-old Los Angeles gangster when he went to prison for 30 years for killing a person. Butler was released last year from San Quentin State Prison, scared and apprehensive and in need of a job. He went to work at a Pit Stop.\n\nTechnically, his job was to prevent drug use in the bathrooms and make sure homeless people didn\u2019t set up camp.\n\n\u201cThe reality is I\u2019m a security guard. I was a babysitter, I was a social worker, I was a counselor. I did a lot of things that was not necessarily in the scope of my job description, but this is my community,\u201d Butler said. \u201cSo my thought was, if I saw somebody that needed help, that\u2019s why I\u2019m there \u2014 to help.\u201d\n\nHomelessness has surged throughout California, and cities are struggling to open more bathrooms. Officials are considering adding port-a-potties and special loos designed by the city of Portland, Oregon, and expanding hours of restrooms in government buildings.\n\nSacramento, which is in a county where a one-night count of the homeless increased 19% in two years, tried a Pit Stop but stopped after a few months because it cost too much.\n\nLos Angeles Councilmember Mike Bonin initially thought the stops too pricey, but he now understands that having someone to watch over the bathrooms has its upsides. Los Angeles saw a 16% increase over a year in its one-night count of homeless, to 36,000.\n\n\u201cI heard from everyone, from people affiliated with law enforcement, from people who live in the neighborhood, from homeless advocates, from people who are homeless themselves, that it\u2019s important to have a staff to make sure they stay clean and free of destruction or abuse,\u201d he said.\n\nDown the street from Ahmed Al Barak\u2019s corner market is Aref Elgaali\u2019s Z Zoul, a Sudanese cafe. The public bathroom by his eatery has helped, he says, but it closes too early, and there should be many more of the toilets.\n\n\u201cWhy not to have in this corner one and that corner one and the other corner one?

With roughly 90,000 vacant lots, neighborhoods have been destabilized and communities abandoned with little action being taken, in their view, to fix the root of the problem.\n\nWhen Paule became sick one recent winter and developed a really bad cough that neither medicine, home remedies or a trip to the doctor could cure, he visited a local store where the owner introduced him to the benefits of raw honey. He explained to Paule that his supply came from a beekeeper. That led to an aha moment for Nicole Lindsey. \u201cWhen that worked, it clicked, like, okay let\u2019s study more about this honey and its medicinal properties,\u201d she says. The couple developed an idea to transform some of Detroit\u2019s vacant lots into urban bee farms. (Follow the hunt for psychotropic honey.)\n\nPaule and Lindsey started Detroit Hives, a non-profit organization, in 2017 as a way to rebuild some of Detroit\u2019s inner-city communities and spread bee awareness. They have successfully converted seven vacant lots into apiaries and currently maintain 34 beehives with plans to add ten more this year. And since most of the produce found in supermarkets\u2014such as fruits, nuts and vegetables\u2014are pollinated by bees, Tim and Nicole are also growing vast amounts of vegetables on their urban farms for their bees to cross pollinate\u2014providing a solution to the food deserts that exist some cities.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know anything about bees, neither did she, so like, there was no ego involved, We both brought our mutual passion and knowledge together,\u201d Paule says \u201cIt\u2019s something we can do together. We built this together, we both have invested into this, we both have a lot of sweat equity put into this.\u201d (Hear from those who are reimagining Detroit.)\n\nAs a power couple whose passion for bee keeping is making an impact on the city of Detroit, their reach extends beyond the parameters of their apiaries. \u201cWe partner with local schools, community organizations, as well as local businesses where they all can play a part in sustainability,\u201d says Paule. \u201cWe host so many tours and field trips at our educational apiary. I think we hosted close to 300 tours.\n\n[Children] get to put on a bee keeping suit and go hands-on into a hive. And this is right in their own community. They don\u2019t have to travel two, three hours away.\u201d (See what would happen if honeybees disappeared.)\n\nThe success of Detroit Hives caught the eye of documentary filmmaker Palmer Morse, who co-directed a film about the project with Rachel Weinberg. He says he was intrigued by the tangible change they were making in their community when he read about them in an online publication. When he saw them in another publication a week later, he decided to reach out.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not very often that you hear about someone, a couple, or anyone, who takes an idea that they have to make change in their community and actually takes it upon themselves to make it happen,\u201d says Morse, co-founder of Spruce Tone Films.\n\n\u201cSpending time with Tim and Nicole just really kind of reminded me that there are still really good people who are making change and shedding positive light on something that\u2019s seen often as negative,\u201d Morse said.\n\nFilming the documentary \u201cDetroit Hives\u201d hit close to home for Morse. \u201cWhen I was in college my parents actually lost their home to foreclosure in Massachusetts and that was a really hard thing for my family to go through. Knowing that in Detroit there are so many homes that have also been victims of foreclosure, often for reasons beyond their control, just being in Detroit and seeing that really hit home for me.\n\n\u201cI kind of feel like I needed to make this film kind of for myself, and have a little bit of closure for what my family went through,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cDetroit Hives\u201d premiered at Freep Film Festival in April 2019. Morse and Weinberg hope to make an impact beyond the film festival circuit. After gaining an understanding of how essential honey bees are to our ecosystem, they would like to with the couple and partner with more non-profit and education-based organizations to bring the film to classrooms.\n\n\u201cSo I think it\u2019s really important to find all these incredible people around the country and all over the world and give them a voice and a platform,\u201d Weinberg says.\n\nLindsey is thrilled about being able to ease fears about bees.\n\n\u201c[I want to encourage] young girls to not be afraid of bees,\u201d she says. \u201cWe get a lot of girls who come to the bee farm who are terrified. And I let them know, hey I was once afraid of bees. It wasn\u2019t until I started learning about them that the fear transferred into love.\u201d (Here are the strangest way humans have consumed honey throughout history.)\n\nThe couple has a goal to reach 200 beehives by 2020.\n\nPaule and Lindsey want to make learning about bee conservation fun and engaging. From fraternity and sorority \u201cbee houses\u201d to plans to build a bee-themed art park, they are just getting started. They say they have become closer as a couple through it all.\n\n\u201cBeing able to [see Nicole] reach her passion and she actually loves it, and it actually allowed her to get over some fears, [is] truly rewarding,\u201d says Paule. \u201cWhenever you start removing a lot of fears, it allows you to grow more as a person. [So this] allows us to grow individually, but also together.\u201d", "title": "Detroit\u2019s urban beekeepers are transforming the city\u2019s vacant lots", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Detroit']"}, {"id": 206, "city": "['Detroit']", "url": "https://www.archpaper.com/2019/06/midtown-cultural-center-detroit-agence-ter-akoaki/", "text": "An effort to connect Detroit\u2019s cluster of some of its most significant institutions, including its iconic Detroit Institute of Arts (DIA), announced today that an international team of urban designers, landscape architects, and technology experts had been selected to create a cultural center in the booming Midtown district.\n\nIn a year-long process, the Midtown Cultural Connections competition selected a team led by Paris-based Agence Ter, Detroit-based architecture and design studio akoaki, Ann Arbor\u2013based hybrid design firm rootoftwo, and University of Michigan assistant professor and urban planner Harley Etienne, along with other partners. The initial design phase, which will bring all parties together to create a formal plan, will take about 18 months, officials said.\n\nThe Agence Ter team suggested creating a sort of frame around the ten blocks containing a group of cultural institutions, including the DIA, Wayne State University, the Detroit Historical Society, the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History, the College For Creative Studies, the Michigan Science Center, and the Scarab Club.\n\nWithin that \u201cDetroit Square,\u201d the project will bring the inside out through \u201ccommon ground\u201d or communal backyards running between the buildings and their landscapes, to be activated with outdoor cafes, performance spaces, a mobile DJ booth, green spaces, public art, as well as live performance spaces for events. Woodward Avenue, which runs through this district, also may see its massive size reduced.\n\nThe selection not only inspires pride among the winning team, said akoaki\u2019s Anya Sirota, but it shows how Detroit\u2019s participating institutions and judges are willing to give \u201can open-ended framework\u201d a chance to succeed.\n\nFor Sirota, that means the design will continue to evolve as the team works with local stakeholders, residents, and other parties to make the cultural center truly the heart of Midtown Detroit, one of the city\u2019s most revitalized and vibrant neighborhoods.\n\n\u201cWe took a risk to create a memorable design that was also suggestable,\u201d Sirota said. \u201cWe felt strongly that we would need additional feedback on these ideas [and] we\u2019re excited that the jury went with something that allowed for more conversation with stakeholders.\u201d\n\nThe size and scope of the project are grand, Sirota added, and previous projects involving this area and around Detroit have gone forward without deep feedback, conversation, and consideration of the long-term effect on the city or its residents. This project seeks to \u201ctread lightly\u201d and be sensitive to placemaking within a city that is more than 300 years old and has concerns about issues like gentrification.\n\nSirota also said she is pleased that the plan the winning team is working on will take issues of mobility, environmental sustainability, and stormwater stewardship into consideration. Having a team made up of experts in physical technology, landscaping, urban planning, and design with a Detroit-centic base should provide many new ideas for the cultural center, she noted.\n\nMidtown Detroit Inc. and DIA launched the design competition in 2017 to find a team that could unite twelve cultural and educational institutions with a kind of \u201ctown square\u201d feel.

It cited her for possession of a farm animal without a permit and having an unlicensed dog.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the first time her and her partner Zomi Huron have gotten the fine, and it probably won\u2019t be the last. The couple owns a produce farm, Ile Ibeji, spread across several lots in Jefferson Chalmers where they keep dozens of fowl\u2014chickens, ducks, geese\u2014and don\u2019t plan on getting rid of any. It\u2019s currently illegal to keep any \u201cwild animals\u201d inside the city limits, according to Detroit\u2019s city code.\n\nKasagam was furious. She and Huron have been keeping animals for years and live on a block with lots of vacancies and only six neighbors, none of whom mind the animals. The law is largely enforced through a complaint-based system, so Kasagam suspects that an outsider spotted the animals and reported it.\n\nFines for violating the ordinance can be as much as $250 per animal. Despite being seven months pregnant with her second child, Kasagam wanted to protest the charge, which could have resulted in jail time. At her court appearance, the judge offered to dismiss the fines and charges if she paid $190 in court fees. She ultimately accepted the deal.\n\nBut she\u2019s still desperate for the city to update the code. Kasagam says animals are an important part of the life-cycle of a farm\u2014their manure reintroduces nutrients into the soil and the animals can be a source of food (milk, eggs, meat). Bees, which are in a legal gray area, pollinate plants.\n\n\u201cThe practice of raising food and livestock at a scale that is healthy is about freedom and self-sufficiency,\u201d Kasagam says. \u201cAnd we should be allowed to do it.\u201d\n\nKasagam isn\u2019t the only farmer who wants the ordinance updated. Some have had their animals confiscated and almost every livestock owner keeps them secret. Kasagam says she knows \u201cat least 50\u201d farmers that keep livestock.\n\nAnimal Care and Control wasn\u2019t able to provide numbers for how many livestock it confiscates and how many fines it issues by the time of publication.\n\nMark Covington, founder of Georgia Street Community Collective, a produce farm in northeast Detroit, isn\u2019t so discreet. At any given time, he has between 40 to 60 fowl, but invites kids, volunteers, and other visitors to his farm almost every day. One of those visitors was Mayor Mike Duggan. He\u2019s also been profiled several times by local and national outlets.\n\nCovington says he keeps his place as clean and quiet as possible to prevent complaints. And similar to Kasagam, he has good relationships with neighbors. \u201cI\u2019ve known these people my whole life,\u201d he says. \u201cThey know I\u2019m not going to do something detrimental. And if they have an issue, they can come talk to me.\u201d\n\nBut his case demonstrates how capriciously the law is enforced and what kinds of issues might arise in the future.\n\nAn ordinance is currently being drafted by the Legislative Policy Division that will set guidelines for animal husbandry in the city. It\u2019s been in the works since roughly 2014, soon after the city amended its urban agriculture ordinance.\n\nIn its latest form, the proposed ordinance would allow for a limited number egg-laying chickens (no roosters), ducks, and honeybees. Kasagam and Covington both own other kinds of fowl and more than would probably be allowed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still going to be illegal even when the ordinance passes,\u201d Covington says.\n\nBut the ordinance has not come before City Council despite years of community engagement, research, drafting, and a clear desire for reform on the part of farmers.\n\nKathryn Lynch Underwood, a city planner with the Legislative Policy Division, has been the main civil servant in charge of the reform effort. When does she hope to have the ordinance passed? \u201cLast year,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ll be as happy as the farmers when it\u2019s done.\u201d\n\nUnderwood says it\u2019s important that Animal Care and Control, which enforces the rule, is comfortable with the changes. But multiple leadership changes at the department have delayed the process; it\u2019s currently looking for a new director.\n\nShe also wants to go back to the community to educate people and make sure there\u2019s a broad consensus about the changes. And not just for farmers. Underwood says many non-farmers are wary of livestock in cities and their accompanying noises and smells. Animal welfare must be considered as well\u2014cages or pens can\u2019t be too crowded and slaughtering of animals presents more complications.\n\nMuch denser cities, like Chicago or New York City, and local ones, like Ann Arbor and Royal Oak, allow for certain kinds of farm animals.\n\nThe current goal is to have an ordinance before City Council by the end of the year. But Underwood is cautious about how much she can promise farmers. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to come up with a policy that will pass,\u201d she says. \u201cWe can always go back in and modify as needed.\u201d\n\nKasagam, on the other hand, is tired of waiting. For five years, farmers have been promised that an ordinance will be finalized, and in the meantime, she\u2019s at risk for getting fined again.\n\n\u201cI absolutely disagree with Kathryn, even though she is an ally,\u201d Kasagam says. \u201cWe\u2019ve been through community hearings.

Perhaps most importantly, low-income neighborhoods that gentrify appear to improve along a number of dimensions known to be correlated with opportunity, and many children are able to remain in these neighborhoods.\u201d\n\nIn a finding that many Detroiters may find surprising, the authors say that Detroit has hardly gentrified at all so far. Of the 1,000 census tracts around the country that have gentrified the most, only two are in Detroit, both in the Midtown area, as measured by the influx of college-educated adults. That\u2019s less than 1% of the potential census tracts in Detroit.\n\nThe contrast with several other major cities is stark, Reed said in a phone conversation.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not saying that change isn\u2019t happening in more than two places in Detroit,\u201d Reed said in a phone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s saying it\u2019s not happening at the same scale that it\u2019s occurring in D.C. or Portland or Seattle. Certainly, people can be concerned about what\u2019s changing Detroit but it\u2019s just not at the same scale as it\u2019s happening elsewhere.\u201d\n\nSpecific findings\n\nFirst, the authors found that when neighborhoods gentrify, they improve in many ways known to be beneficial for children, such as seeing lower poverty rates and better schools. And they found that many original resident children, including the least advantaged, are able to stay and benefit from those changes.\n\nSome of the long-resident children are even more likely to attend and complete college, they found.\n\nNext, the study disputes the idea that large numbers of people are displaced during the gentrification process.\n\n\u201cThe results for children and adults show that many original residents are able to remain in gentrifying neighborhoods and share in any neighborhood improvements,\u201d the authors write.\n\nAnd while some people are displaced, the actual number is far less than the number who would have moved anyway given the natural flow as people move in and out.\n\n\u201cGentrification increases out-migration to any other neighborhood by 4 to 6 percentage points for less-educated renters and by slightly less for other groups,\u201d the study found. \u201cHowever, these effects are somewhat modest relative to baseline cross-neighborhood migration rates of 70% to 80% for renters and 40% for homeowners.\u201d\n\nMore: How downtown Detroit's taxes work and who really pays them\n\nMore: Few black people get home mortgages in Detroit, data show\n\nAnd even those displaced fare better than often believed, the study found.\n\n\u201cImportantly, we find no evidence that movers from gentrifying neighborhoods, including the most disadvantaged residents, move to observably worse neighborhoods or experience negative changes to employment, income, or commuting distance.\u201d\n\nFamiliar findings\n\nThis is hardly the first study to find that the dangers of gentrification have been overstated, especially in Detroit. The 2015 \u201cGentrification in America\u201d study by Governing magazine looked at census tracts in the nation\u2019s 50 largest cities to see whether home prices and education levels had risen significantly between 2009 and 2013.\n\nThe study found that Portland, Oregon, Washington, D.C., Minneapolis and Seattle were all hotbeds of gentrification, places where at least 50% of their census tracts had shown dramatic changes in home values and education levels. But Detroit ranked near the bottom, along with El Paso, Texas, and Las Vegas.\n\nOf almost 300 census tracts in Detroit, only seven had gentrified between 2009 and 2013 \u2014 just 2.8%, among the lowest of any U.S. city studied in the 2015 analysis.\n\nAnd tellingly, even those seven tracts in Detroit, widely scattered through the city, all showed population loss during the study period. The seven gentrifying districts had gone upscale in terms of education and home values but had lost ground in other ways.\n\nThis is not to suggest that cities like Detroit don't suffer from many urban ills. But Alan Mallach, a noted urban planning expert, writes in his recent book \u201cThe Divided City\u201d (Island Press, 344 pages, $30) that gentrification in a few neighborhoods obscures the real problem \u2014 concentrated poverty and unemployment in neighborhoods that never gentrify.\n\n\"Gentrification may be happening in a few corners of Detroit, but the big story in that city \u2014 even if it doesn't get the attention it deserves \u2014 is the persistence of concentrated, debilitating poverty and the decline of once-healthy, vital neighborhoods,\" he wrote\n\nPart of the disagreement over neighborhood change is that the word \u201cgentrification\u201d has become a catchall term to mean many kinds of urban ills and trends well beyond neighborhood change.\n\n\u201cOne of the reasons the debate is so difficult is because everybody defines things a little differently and that allows certain words to stand in for other things that are happening,\u201d Reed said.\n\nDebate will continue\n\nA study like this is unlikely to still the debate over neighborhood change in Detroit. Indeed, Mayor Mike Duggan\u2019s administration and City Council have increasingly pressed developers building new housing and commercial projects to set aside units for affordable housing or to open retail in the city\u2019s neighborhoods as a way of softening the impacts of neighborhood change.\n\nNew York, meanwhile, is in the middle of a fierce debate on new legislative protections for renters to combat rising rents.\n\nBut Reed insists that cities are more naturally resilient than the debate over neighborhood change might indicate. Neighborhood change, especially if it means new residents moving into a city, often brings more benefits than harm.\n\n\u201cIf you just walk around a lot of these cities, some neighborhoods in Detroit, you do see that neighborhoods seem to be changing a lot,\u201d Reed said. \u201cEastern Market, the Midtown corridor, they are different than they were 10 years ago. But neighborhoods are a lot more dynamic than the standard narrative assumes.\u201d\n\nContact John Gallagher: 313-222-5173 or gallagher@freepress.com. Follow him on Twitter @jgallagherfreep.

Its juried projects \u2014 recently-completed or now-underway \u2014 are grouped into the six themes of City Systems, Economy, Housing, Neighborhoods, and Public Space.

Then they came to a century-old brown brick building, also three stories tall, with rows of windows on both sides of a recessed entryway. The six-unit condominium building from 1910 was flanked by 2\u00bd-story blue houses\u2014one a single-family home, the other a triplex.

In December, Neighbors for More Neighbors, the group co-founded by Flisrand and Edwards about two years ago to address Minneapolis\u2019 affordable housing crisis, won a victory unseen in any other major American city. The city council approved the Minneapolis 2040 comprehensive plan, which declares the city\u2019s intent to abolish single-family-home zoning and allow duplexes and triplexes to be built anywhere in the city.\n\nThe city council abolished single-family-home zoning to address Minneapolis' rapid growth in recent years. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine\n\n\u201cLots of people want to live here,\u201d said Flisrand. \u201cIt\u2019s a great city to live in. And we have used our city policies to keep people out.\u201d\n\nCities across the country are booming, but their growth is exacerbating an already critical lack of affordable housing for the middle class and poor alike. The solutions being proposed in many cities run the gamut from rent control to federal subsidies, but Minneapolis has landed on something even bolder that strikes at the heart of how cities have grown and defined themselves over the past century. Single-family-only neighborhoods, a staple of city and suburban planning, are woven into the DNA of the American dream: the leafy, peaceful street lined with stand-alone houses, green lawns and plenty of elbow room. Minneapolis\u2019 new vision of itself would essentially rewrite that code\u2014reshaping the urban streetscape around walking and mass transit and rebooting the American dream to be more racially and economically inclusive.\n\nMinneapolis\u2019 new comprehensive plan has drawn praise from divergent political quarters\u2014both Housing Secretary Ben Carson, who visited Minneapolis recently, and the New York Times editorial page. And cities and states with their own growth-driven housing crises are looking to Minneapolis for clues on how to navigate the political shoals inherent in any debate over development and growth.

In other cities, NIMBYs\u2014conservative \u201cNot In My Back Yard\u201d defenders of suburban-style living\u2014often make alliances with left-wing critics of gentrification to choke off new supply. But in Minneapolis, a progressive city council persuaded a broad coalition of racial-justice activists and nonprofit affordable-housing advocates to align with zoning-reform supporters behind a package of housing efforts meant to help both the middle class and the poor. Along with Minneapolis 2040\u2019s vision of a denser city, the city council also approved $40 million in affordable-housing funds and requirements that some developers include lower-cost units in their projects. New protections for tenants are coming next.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve avoided a political coalition between folks who want to stop development and [those who] support progressive change,\u201d said Lisa Bender, Minneapolis\u2019 city council president. \u201cIn Minneapolis, for now, we have a political coalition that is supportive of adding more housing and demanding a race-equity approach to housing access. Now it\u2019s incumbent on the city to actually do that in a meaningful way. And I\u2019m not sure any city has done that.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nMinneapolis officials have known for the better part of a decade that the city\u2019s economic health was creating a problem.\n\nTop left: The light rail sees a rush of commuters every morning in downtown Minneapolis.

People are migrating to Minneapolis to enjoy the vibrant urban scenes on its main avenues near downtown, its vast green neighborhoods of pre-World War II homes, and its plentiful parks along its many lakes and creeks. The Minneapolis-St. Paul region\u2019s economy is thriving, led by prospering Fortune 500 companies such as UnitedHealth Group, Target and Best Buy. But the metro area is adding population faster than it\u2019s adding housing\u201483,000 new households, but only 63,000 new houses, since 2010. So home-sale prices and rents are going up. In May, the median home-sale price in the Twin Cities area reached $285,000, up 5.2 percent from last year. Hopeful homebuyers face bidding wars. With vacancy rates low, tenants face climbing rents: The average monthly rent of a two-bedroom apartment in the city reached $1,847 this winter, while the vacancy rate is 3.7 percent. (Economists often consider a 5 percent vacancy rate \u201chealthy\u201d; below that, housing costs rise faster than inflation.) Spiking costs now threaten a cornerstone of Minneapolis\u2019 prosperity, as young people find it ever harder to afford living there.\n\nMark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine How Would You Improve Affordable Housing In Your City?\n\nBy Politico Staff\n\n5 Lessons from Cities On Affordable Housing\n\nBy Bill Duryea\n\n\u201cRight now in Minneapolis, we have a whole lot of people that want to live here, and we\u2019re proud of that,\u201d said Mayor Jacob Frey. \u201cBut we don\u2019t have the supply to accommodate it. And when you\u2019ve got demand that is sky-high but not the supply to accommodate it, it\u2019s just common sense: The prices, the rents, go through the roof.\u201d\n\nMinneapolis\u2019 embrace of urban density began in 2013, when voters elected several young, progressive new city council candidates, including Bender. A Minnesota native, she\u2019d worked as a San Francisco city planner before coming home. \u201cWhen I moved back to Minneapolis, I saw that housing costs were much lower, but I saw the progression of folks moving in,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t see the city having the right kind of aggressive policy in place to keep our city affordable.\u201d\n\nBender, 41, who became city council president in 2018, nerds out with glee while talking urbanist policy, from housing near transit stops to protected bike lanes. (She founded the Minneapolis Bicycle Coalition, now renamed Our Streets Minneapolis.) \u201cMy very first ordinance was to legalize accessory dwelling units!\u201d she enthuses. To build support among reluctant council colleagues, she recruited allies such as AARP, which advocates for so-called granny apartments and garage flats.\n\n\u201cWe opened up the dialogue around who gets to live where in our city,\u201d Bender said.\n\nMinneapolis City Council President Lisa Bender cast a wide net for feedback on the 2040 plan, which debuted in 2018 with 100 policies. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine\n\nNext, Bender and her City Hall allies set their eye on Minneapolis\u2019 comprehensive plan, which all Minnesota cities have to update every decade. Usually, these plans are dry policy documents that attract little public attention. Before 2013, Bender said, the city\u2019s feedback was mostly limited to neighborhood associations, so it usually heard from older, white homeowners. This time around, the city council approved an ambitious plan to gather citizen ideas at community meetings, street festivals and farmer\u2019s markets.\n\nThis wider approach tapped into the 52 percent of Minneapolis residents who are renters, many of them young and keenly interested in lower housing costs but also climate change, transportation and racial justice. \u201cWhen we set up enough room for the community to actually weigh in, and not just the folks who are opposed to things, there is a lot of public support for increasing housing options,\u201d Bender said.\n\nBy 2017, housing had become a major issue in the city elections. Frey, a young councilman, was elected mayor on a platform of increasing housing density, tripling spending on affordable housing, and reducing residential segregation. \u201cI unabashedly took stances saying that I believe in affordable housing in every neighborhood throughout the city,\u201d said Frey, 37, a Virginia-native lawyer who moved to Minneapolis after running a marathon there.\n\nTop left: Twenty-five-year-old Joel Page, here walking his dog Stout, is one of the many Minneapolis residents living in an apartment complex.

He and others say single-family zoning evolved as a way for Minneapolis and other cities to practice racial discrimination by another name.\n\nSince 2016, Minneapolis residents have exposed their city\u2019s history of housing discrimination in a way that\u2019s unusual for an American metropolis. Inspired by a project that digitized the federal government\u2019s 1930s redlining maps, which declared black neighborhoods \u201chazardous\u201d for investment, volunteers for Minneapolis\u2019 Mapping Prejudice project have scanned and mapped 17,000 local real-estate deeds with racial restrictions from the 1910s through 1940s.\n\n\u201cWhen those explicitly racist policies became illegal through the Civil Rights Act, we and other cities throughout the country started doing things implicitly through our zoning code,\u201d said Frey. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve set it up so that unless you can own a really big home on a really big parcel, you can\u2019t live in huge swaths of the city.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, city staff debuted an early draft of the Minneapolis 2040 plan. A broad planning document with 100 policies on everything from carbon-free energy to tree canopies, it attracted the most attention for its \u201cPolicy 1,\u201d which called for increased housing density citywide and an end to single-family zoning. The early draft would\u2019ve allowed four-unit buildings everywhere in the city. Larger apartment and condominium buildings could be built closer to downtown and along public transit routes. The new rules applied to renovation and new construction: subdividing houses, building additions, new construction on vacant lots, and new construction after existing housing was torn down.\n\nNot everyone in the city is in favor of the 2040 plan. Anti-2040 lawn signs sit perched in south (left) and north (right) Minneapolis. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine\n\nThe initial proposal divided Minneapolis, as opponents rose up to defend single-family zoning. Red lawn signs warned of developers bulldozing neighborhoods to build apartments.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure we bought the argument that more density increased affordable housing,\u201d said Lisa McDonald, a former city council member and a member of the anti-2040 group Minneapolis For Everyone. \u201cWe felt we\u2019d get very little affordable housing, but we would be giving developers carte blanche.\u201d\n\nThat left Frey, who ran for mayor as a progressive, in the awkward position of defending the for-profit housing industry, which quietly supported the 2040 plan but didn\u2019t publicly advocate for it. \u201cPeople who need homes can\u2019t be collateral damage in an antideveloper, antibusiness agenda,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have people that need the supply.\u201d\n\n\n\n***\n\nThat\u2019s when the deal-making started.\n\nTo overcome the opposition, Frey, Bender and their staffs reduced the promised new zoning in single-family neighborhoods from four-unit buildings to triplexes. They negotiated with council members over changes to future zoning on transit corridors in their wards.\n\nLocal housing advocates, including University of Minnesota urban affairs researcher Dr. Brittany Lewis (bottom), are unconvinced that the 2040 plan will effectively address Minneapolis' racial disparities. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine\n\nTo build a coalition behind the plan, the council voted on two other housing policies the same week as Minneapolis 2040. First, it approved Frey\u2019s budget, which funded $40 million in affordable housing programs, up from about $15 million. Then, the same day council approved Minneapolis 2040 by a 12-1 vote, it passed an interim \u201cinclusionary zoning\u201d ordinance. Common in other big cities, inclusionary zoning requires apartment-building developers to set aside some of a complex\u2019s units for people with below-average incomes. \u201cThis city council won\u2019t support making it easier to build housing without a requirement that some of that housing be affordable,\u201d Bender said.\n\nThe package deal helped gather support for the 2040 plan from nonprofit affordable-housing advocates, who were lukewarm about zoning for more density.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great that a city has said we\u2019re going to open up the zoning books and get creative about how we can boost density,\u201d said Russ Adams, executive director of The Alliance, a nonprofit advocate on racial and economic justice issues. \u201cBut without regulation, the market is going to behave exactly the way it always behaves.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, representatives of the for-profit housing industry support Minneapolis 2040\u2019s embrace of higher density but say it won\u2019t likely solve the housing shortage on its own.\n\n\u201cIf it produces 50 units in a year, in my mind, it\u2019ll be a big success,\u201d John Rask, a homebuilder and the president of the builders\u2019 group BATC-Housing First Minnesota, said. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone sees 500 units a year coming out of triplexes. But every little bit helps.\u201d Other parts of Minneapolis 2040, like increased density along transit corridors, should help, he said. But he argues that the city needs relief in parking requirements, lower city fees, and expedited permit and zoning approvals, rather than an inclusionary zoning policy.\n\nTop: Tabitha Mongtomery and Russ Adams of the Powderhorn Park Neighborhood Association are also skeptical of the 2040 plan.

Minneapolis\u2019s racial disparities are among the worst in the nation. The gaps between white and nonwhite homeownership and poverty in the Minneapolis-St. Paul region are the largest among the nation\u2019s 25 largest metro areas. Three out of four whites in the region own their own homes; only one in four African Americans do. Density in more neighborhoods may give people of color more choices about where to live, but it doesn\u2019t address the wealth gaps that past discrimination helped create.\n\n\u201cThe city has to put its money where its mouth is, and redistribute resources to make high density equal affordability,\u201d Dr. Brittany Lewis, an urban affairs researcher at the University of Minnesota, said. \u201cA lot of small developers of color are trying to get in the development game because they want to invest in the communities in which they live. And it\u2019s extremely challenging.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear what kind of future awaits Minneapolis, but abolishing single-family-home zoning means that mixed-housing neighborhoods will become increasingly common, with apartment buildings such as this subsidized housing complex looking over single-family homes. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine\n\nTabitha Montgomery, executive director of the Powderhorn Park Neighborhood Association, feels conflicted about the Minneapolis 2040 plan. \u201cIn theory, adding housing units to the city will be helpful to persons of color,\u201d she said. Minneapolis\u2019 low rental vacancy rate especially hurts immigrants and black women, she said. \u201cOur wealth level doesn\u2019t allow us to be competitive sometimes with other persons who are pursuing housing.\u201d But Montgomery isn\u2019t convinced that Minneapolis 2040 will end up benefiting the most vulnerable. She wants the city to focus more on nonprofit affordable housing.\n\nThe mayor says he especially wants to help black and indigenous residents become homeowners. Homeownership is a major goal in the city\u2019s $40 million affordable-housing budget. The Minneapolis Homes program, with $5 million funding this year, offers downpayment assistance loans for homebuyers and city-owned vacant land and vacant houses for sale. Frey notes that North Minneapolis, a majority-minority neighborhood, could benefit from the program, since the city owns 300 vacant homes or lots in North Minneapolis alone.\n\nNow the Minneapolis 2040 plan is before the Metropolitan Council, the Twin Cities\u2019 powerful regional planning board, which is widely expected to approve it later this year. After that, the city council intends to enact the planning zoning changes into law. The 2040 plan may become an issue in the 2021 city elections, if its opponents get their way. \u201cWe\u2019ll be looking at bringing in some council members who are listening to the citizens more,\u201d said McDonald.\n\nBut the mayor predicts the 2040 plan\u2019s results will eventually vindicate his approach. \u201cWhile people might hate my guts for a couple of years,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m confident that a little down the road, it\u2019ll be apparent that we took the right route.\u201d", "title": "How Minneapolis Freed Itself From the Stranglehold of Single-Family Homes", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Minneapolis']"}, {"id": 212, "city": "['Minneapolis']", "url": "https://www.startribune.com/minneapolis-celebrates-black-business-week-through-july-27/512900102/", "text": "CEO Jashan Eison of H&B Elevator of north Minneapolis\n\nBlack-owned Mama Sheila\u2019s restaurant at 38th Street and Bloomington Avenue S. will host the inaugural gathering at noon Friday [today] that kicks off Black Business Week, the City of Minneapolis-sponsored, 13-event salute to the nearly 1,000 black-owned businesses in Minneapolis that runs through July 27.\n\nThere will be events for employers, budding entrepreneurs, job seekers and others stakeholders.\n\nMayor Jacob Frey and City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins will host a panel discussion at Mama Sheila\u2019s.

In an acknowledgement that they are here to stay (at least until the next rideshare craze), the city of Minneapolis has launched a pilot program to set best practices.\n\nThe year-long program is aimed at determining how best to position scooters as a long-term viable transportation option for the city. Minneapolis selected four participating companies for the pilot: Jump, Lyft, Spin, and Lime.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled that our application has been approved,\u201d says a spokeswoman for San Francisco-based Lime. \u201cWe look forward to returning to Minneapolis and furthering our commitment to more affordable, equitable transportation for all.\u201d\n\nPer terms of the license agreements for all providers, the number of scooters allowed in the city is capped at 2,000, with each company getting an equal share of that total fleet size. No more than 800 scooters will be allowed in the downtown area and surrounding neighborhoods, and at least 600 scooters must be available in lower-income areas including north, northeast, and south Minneapolis.\n\nThe new program comes after a summer in which motorized scooters, often called e-scooters\u2014\u2014exploded onto Twin Cities streets seemingly overnight, particularly those from California-based Bird Rides Inc., leaving the municipalities scrambling to figure out regulations for the vehicles.\n\nWhen Bird arrived on scene early last summer, Minneapolis had already begun developing an ordinance for parking and licensing rules, so it was able to vote on it fairly quickly, while St. Paul asked the company to remove its fleet until regulations could be formulated.\n\nSt. Paul\u2019s request was in vain, as Bird kept its scooters on the streets through the season. There\u2019s been no indication, though, that Bird plans to return to the city this year, and St. Paul hasn\u2019t struck a deal with any other electric vehicle operator yet.\n\nSo, as it stands, you won\u2019t find either e-bikes or e-scooters in St. Paul, even as the other half of the Twin Cities sees Nice Ride bikes roll out and the scooter pilot program begin.\n\nThe Minneapolis pilot program aligns with the work of the Minneapolis Transportation Action Plan update, a 10-year strategy to implement alternative transportation options that address various issues including climate, safety, and socioeconomic equity.\n\nThe pilot program is paying particular attention to socioeconomic equity, with a requirement that operators offer low-income pricing programs and alternative access options (like making them payable by cash) for people who don\u2019t have smartphones.\n\nIn regards to safety concerns, operators must provide education and outreach to consumers on safe riding and parking practices. Per state laws, scooters must follow the same road rules as bicyclists, can\u2019t be ridden on sidewalks, and must be parked upright outside of pedestrian walkway space.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to able to offer Jump scooters in the Twin Cities and look forward to working with the City to roll out the pilot,\u201d says a Jump spokesperson.\n\nNeither Jump, nor any of the operators have yet debuted their scooters in Minneapolis, but fleets are expected to hit the streets soon\u2014within this spring.", "title": "Minneapolis Plans for a Future with Motorized Scooters", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Minneapolis']"}, {"id": 214, "city": "['Minneapolis']", "url": "https://www.minnpost.com/metro/2019/09/five-takeaways-from-minneapolis-new-plan-to-boost-street-safety/", "text": "Minneapolis transportation leaders unveiled a three-year plan Tuesday to boost street safety with lower speed limits, new traffic enforcement officers, additional crosswalks and other roadway changes. Here are the plan\u2019s biggest takeaways, traffic trends that motivated the proposals, and when residents could begin noticing different rules for getting around the city:\n\nThe number of people killed or seriously injured in traffic crashes in Minneapolis has gone up\n\nBetween the mid-2000s and 2013, the number of severe or deadly collisions on Minneapolis streets decreased, according to city data that transportation leaders shared with City Council members Tuesday. But in 2014, the trend reversed \u2014 cause by a spike in vehicle vs. pedestrian crashes specifically \u2014 and 2016 and 2017, the city saw the decade\u2019s highest number of incidents in which someone on any mode suffered a serious injury. Last year alone, three people died walking in Minneapolis, and traffic engineers recorded more than 330 additional injuries among pedestrians.\n\nArticle continues after advertisement\n\n\u201cThose are not numbers,\u201d said Ethan Fawley, of the city\u2019s Public Works Department, which is leading the plan. \u201cThose are lives \u2014 those are people, families forever impacted.\u201d\n\nThe troubling trend is the reason for the plan, called Vision Zero, which is part of a nationwide initiative to eliminate all traffic-related deaths and injuries in its roughly 35 participating cities. Fawley and city staff spent the past two years compiling the data to create the draft proposal, which will guide how the city spends money on road safety improvements between 2020 and 2022.\n\nMinneapolis is preparing to lower speed limits.\n\nAs Minneapolis\u2019 Vision Zero program coordinator, Fawley and local transportation leaders statewide lobbied state lawmakers this spring to allow large municipalities to establish their own speed limits on city-owned streets, rather than relying on state law. They were successful, and the city of Minneapolis does not want to waste time with making the changes official on the streets it owns. (The reduced levels would not apply to Hennepin County roads or state Interstates.)\n\n\u201cWe know that [lower speeds] will save lives,\u201d Fawley said, pointing to studies that show how the severity of crashes often correlates with drivers\u2019 speed. \u201cHigher traffic speeds [make] it harder for somebody to stop, so increases the likelihood of crashes and \u2026 increases the chances that a crash could be deadly or lead to severe injury, and that is especially true for people walking.\u201d\n\nMinneapolis\u2019 Traffic Operations Engineer Steve Mosing said reduced speed limits make sense for his city, in particular, due to the complexity of the system \u2014 including electric scooters, app-based ride shares, protected bike lanes \u2014 and a street grid system with intersections at every 300 to 600 feet.\n\nBut it\u2019s not yet clear where, and to what extent, drivers would have to adjust their speeds under the new proposal. A separate ordinance would determine those details, pending City Council approval.\n\nCurrently, Minneapolis transportation officials are in talks with those in St. Paul so that they create a consistent plan for new speed limits across the cities, as well as analyzing traffic on a street-by-street basis (most have speed limits between 20 and 40 mph). \u201cIt\u2019s important for the city of Minneapolis to have a defensible \u2026 study with integrity that\u2019s based on engineering,\u201d Mosing said. \u201cThe actual physics and the environment of the roadway plays a huge role.\u201d\n\nFawley said he hopes to have specific recommendations for reduced speeds by early next year, on which the council will vote.\n\nArticle continues after advertisement\n\nThe first priority is addressing the most dangerous roads and intersections.\n\nThe Vision Zero effort has uncovered where, exactly, serious collisions in Minneapolis most often occur, whether because of speeding, distracted driving or other risky behavior: intersections (many of which with light signals) and on streets with higher speed limits (more than 25 mph) and traffic volume.\n\nThe plan categorizes those areas as \u201chigh-injury\u201d corridors, which make up about 10 percent of all streets in the city \u2014 such as University, Central, Lowry, Hiawatha, Hennepin and Franklin avenues, as well as Broadway, Lake and 38th streets.\n\nOver the next three years, crews will go corridor by corridor in those areas to change street designs or add new traffic features to try to keep people of all modes (by car, foot or bicycle) safe. Various pools of municipal money could pay for the improvements, though the overall financial plan is unclear considering the early stage of Vision Zero and how it fits into other safety efforts already under way.\n\nAmong changes to the busy streets, crews will convert some four-lane roads (two lanes in each direction) \u2014 which could include Lyndale, Third and Hennepin avenues, as well as 31st Street East \u2014 into three lanes (one lane in each direction with a center turn lane). They\u2019ll also install new traffic-calming features \u2014 such as bollards or delineators \u2014 in place of parking spots so that parked cars don\u2019t block pedestrians trying to cross the street, as well as adjust the timing of signalized intersections and add medians in some areas to separate opposing lanes of traffic.\n\n\u201cPutting these types of devices in creates a culture where the most vulnerable piece of the population, which would be our pedestrians, is better acknowledged on our street system,\u201d Mosing said. By 2022, they are hoping to have made improvements to hundreds of intersections alone.\n\nThe city is also planning to paint more crosswalks on roads, under guidelines in the draft plan, and update city rules regarding private development to ensure that developers follow traffic-safety standards in their building designs.\n\nLooking at development trends and travel patterns, a Vision Zero engineer \u2014 whom the city has yet to hire \u2014 will come up with specifics for the roadway changes, Mosing said.\n\nAt a Transportation and Public Works Committee meeting Tuesday, when the Vision Zero team presented the draft plan to council members for the first time, elected leaders expressed support for the effort\u2019s plan to modify roadways with additional signs, signal adjustments or new features.\n\nArticle continues after advertisement\n\n\u201cThe more we can manipulate the environment and change the environment to change behavior, the more effective that we\u2019re going to be,\u201d Council Member Cam Gordon said at the meeting. \u201cWhen you make something structurally impossible to do, people aren\u2019t going to be able to do it.\u201d\n\nThe mayor wants a new traffic enforcement unit within The Minneapolis Police Department.\n\nVision Zero sets a framework for following through with a 2020 budget request by Frey to grow the Minneapolis Police Department\u2019s number of traffic enforcement officers from zero to three.\n\nAs part of his citywide funding plan for next year, the mayor announced last month he wants to create a new \u201cAccident Reduction\u201d unit within the police department to monitor for law breakers on the road.\n\nIt\u2019s not a novel idea in Minneapolis: The city had a traffic-enforcement unit until 2003, when it eliminated the team \u201cdue to reduced staffing levels,\u201d Frey\u2019s budget says. Since then, patrol officers have been in charge of citing roadway users for violations, which can include red-light running or speeding, on top of answering 911 calls.\n\nPending approval from the City Council in December, Frey\u2019s budget proposal would set aside $355,000 annually, as well as a one-time boost of $207,000, to create the new officer positions and pay for squad cars. Existing sworn cops would fill the openings, and the mayor wants the new team to work with the police department\u2019s existing Traffic Investigations Unit.\n\nThe investigations team includes just four people who responded to 4,491 hit-and-run crashes, 609 DWI cases, 181 dispatch calls in which drivers fled the area, 126 squad accidents and 8 deadly collisions last year alone, Frey\u2019s budget says.\n\nAt Tuesday\u2019s committee meeting, Council President Lisa Bender, who represents neighborhoods south of downtown, voiced skepticism of the increased focus on traffic enforcement. She said she\u2019d like for the extra attention from officers to focus specifically on areas where the most crashes occur for the best chance of more citations curbing accidents and ensuring equity, yet she still has concerns over the amount of city dollars for the efforts versus other safety improvements.\n\nTo address those concerns, Robin Hutcheson, the city\u2019s Public Works director, emphasized that the city is in contact with transportation officials in St. Paul, which currently has a traffic enforcement unit. There, officers base their work on input from traffic engineers, as well as data specific to the capital city and compiled by a University of Minnesota researcher.\n\n\u201cThey saw a pretty dramatic increase in compliance,\u201d she said of the new approach, adding that Minneapolis may try to get the same type of U-led study to help the enforcement efforts.\n\nMinneapolis is preparing for automated enforcement technology \u2014 even though state law doesn\u2019t allow it (yet).\n\nVision Zero sets the groundwork for installing technology on streets and sidewalks that aim to catch illegal behavior by drivers, while freeing up officers for other things. The technology could be cameras at signalized intersections to catch red-light runners or speed trackers on neighborhood streets to ensure motorists obey the limits, but the plan does not include details.\n\nBut current state law does not permit the technology, and opponents for years have argued that the recording devices infringe on their privacy.\n\nThe city of Minneapolis (alongside other jurisdictions) has tried for years to advocate for a change to the state statute, with no success. For now, though, Fawley said traffic engineers are launching a study to determine how they would roll out the technology if, or when, state lawmakers come around to it.\n\n\u201cPeople should expect that, you know, we are focusing on those [illegal] behaviors so they can address their behavior,\u201d Fawley said.\n\nLooking ahead\n\nVision Zero is just one piece of the city\u2019s transportation plan. The newly released draft plan fits within broader policy frameworks, such as Minneapolis\u2019 Transportation Action Plan and Minneapolis 2040, which establish long-term goals for street design and traffic improvements as the city grows. Vision Zero also builds upon already-established safety efforts at both the local and state levels.\n\nOnce the city closes a public comment period on Oct. 16, Fawley\u2019s team will revise the draft plan based on the feedback and then present a new version to the council in late 2019 or early 2020. They are set to go through the same steps in a few years and create another plan that builds on the latest plan\u2019s proposals.\n\nHutcheson, the city\u2019s director of Public Works, described the plan as a catalyst to \u201crefine and accelerate\u201d the overall push for better street designs and traffic features to keep people safe. Because one traffic-related death or injury in Minneapolis is one too many, supporters have said.\n\n\u201cThis list of folks who died on our streets last year \u2014 that is unacceptable,\u201d Fawley said. \u201cTogether, we can do something about it.\u201d", "title": "Five takeaways from Minneapolis\u2019 new plan to boost street safety", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Minneapolis']"}, {"id": 215, "city": "['Minneapolis']", "url": "https://www.fox9.com/news/minneapolis-city-council-unanimously-approves-ordinance-preventing-tenant-screening", "text": "article\n\nThe Minneapolis City Council voted unanimously Friday morning to approve a controversial new ordinance designed to protect renters.\n\nThe renter\u2019s protection ordinance prevents landlords from using old criminal or housing records to deny applicants.

Although the pipes are still used, many are clogged to a fraction of their carrying capacity by tuberculation of minerals that have built up over time like coral reefs inside of them. Ancient gate valves made of iron with bronze-mounted gate assemblies, originally installed to isolate portions of a pipeline for repair purposes, have seized in their open positions due to mineral deposits and corrosion necessitating more customer interruptions when failures occur.\n\nMany of our gravity sewers are made of vitrified (baked) clay pipe, invented by the ancient Egyptians and still used into the 1980s. Many of these pipes have cracked or their poor joining systems have been choked with plant roots, allowing groundwater to infiltrate the pipes, creating higher sewage treatment costs. Old hand-laid brick manholes, the junction boxes of gravity sewers, replaced by factory-made precast concrete manholes, are also tremendous sources of infiltrated rain and groundwater. Forced sewage mains, made from highly corrosive iron, with no protective lining, are collapsing from hydrogen-sulfide gas eating through the top of the pipes and contaminating everything with the toxic contents.

That means Tampa could not legally go forward with using reclaimed water for any other purpose, according to the memo.\n\n\u201cIt seems clear that the parties intended to limit the use of reclaimed water by the member governments to irrigation and other non-potable purposes and for Tampa Bay Water to have the exclusive right to utilize reclaimed water for potable purposes,\u201d attorney George Nickerson wrote in the Aug. 5 memo to Tampa Bay Water officials.\n\n\u201cThis should be the nail in the coffin\u201d for Tampa\u2019s reclaimed water project, said St. Petersburg Councilwoman Darden Rice, a Tampa Bay Water board member who has repeatedly raised questions about Tampa\u2019s plans.\n\n\u201cIn a common-sense world,\u201d she said, no one would want to spend another dime pursuing it.\n\nShe also predicted the memo would also save Tampa Bay Water from being torn apart by Tampa trying to launch a water supply venture on its own.\n\nHowever the most vocal proponent of what the city calls the Tampa Augmentation Project, Tampa Councilman Charlie Miranda, pooh-poohed those comments.\n\n\u201cAttorneys are like tires,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce in a while one of them will go flat.\u201d\n\nMultiple attorneys have looked at Tampa\u2019s proposal, he pointed out, but this is the first one to say Tampa is legally prevented from attempting it.

Rice and other Tampa Bay Water officials have said they worry Tampa\u2019s project is the first step in trying to break up the utility, but Tampa officials have denied that is their goal.\n\nThe Tampa Augmentation Project was a top priority for former Mayor Bob Buckhorn, who left office in May. Tampa officials have said the whole region would benefit from their plan to inject up to 50 million gallons a day of treated wastewater into the underground water table to provide an added layer of cleansing before it is pumped back up into reservoirs and, eventually, faucets and showers.\n\nCritics have dubbed the $350 million project \u2014 expected to come online in 2027 \u2014 \u201ctoilet to tap.\u201d It has faced a string of delays over unanswered questions about whether it would work and whether it would cause harm to the environment.\n\nThe Howard F.

People were spotted riding the scooters in banned areas, such as the Tampa Riverwalk, or parking them haphazardly and blocking sidewalks and entryways, Tampa Transportation Director Jean Duncan said.\n\n\"We're hoping maybe it's a little bit of growing pains in the first couple days and we'll see better compliance on the part of the operators as well as the users that we wanted to see from the beginning,\" Duncan said. \"This looks good on paper, but is it going to work in reality?\"\n\nThe latest transportation fad is solidly in place in several cities, but Tampa has taken its time launching the one-year pilot program, which allows up to 2,400 scooters to operate around town.\n\nPREVIOUS COVERAGE: Will scooters help or hurt the way we get around in Tampa Bay? We're about to find out\n\nAs of Tuesday, only two companies \u2014 Spin and Bird \u2014 currently have scooters out on the streets for people to ride. Competitors Lime and Jump, the other two companies approved for the pilot, should be running here soon, Duncan said.\n\nThe scooters can travel up to 15 mph and are meant to help people get to destinations that are too far to comfortably walk, but not far enough to warrant a car trip. Riders rent the scooters through an app on their smart phone.\n\nSpin reported 2,500 trips on its scooters over the weekend. A Bird spokesman said the company does not share ridership numbers.\n\nWhile people can take trips all over the city, there are a few no-ride zones, including the Riverwalk, Bayshore Boulevard and East Seventh Street in Ybor City. The city contacted both Spin and Bird with complaints that people were riding scooters in banned areas. Bird said its app prohibits people from riding there and will slow the vehicle gradually to a full stop when a rider enters one of those zones.\n\n\"Several riders then think the battery is dead and park it nearby,\" Bird representative Servando Esparza wrote in an email to the city. \"Most will follow the in-app notifications to move outside the riding zone to continue riding.\"\n\nSpin shared a similar experience, but made a couple additional tweaks to discourage people from riding in those zones and leaving the scooter behind. Spin representative Dan Fleischbein changed the settings so the company's scooters slow down to 10 mph at Curtis Hixon Park and 3 mph in no-ride zones. He also made the Riverwalk a no-park zone.\n\n\"It is 3 mph, so it's not rideable, but forces people to remove them from the Riverwalk,\" Flesichbein wrote in an email. \"This appears to solve the problem. We are constantly tweaking and adjusting to create a safe, enjoyable experience for riders and non-riders alike.\"\n\nCurrently, people can ride scooters only on the sidewalk. That will change if Gov. Ron DeSantis signs a bill sponsored by State Sen. Jeff Brandes and State Rep. Jackie Toledo. The legislation from the Tampa Bay Republicans allows scooters on streets and bike paths, but leaves the decisions up to local governments.\n\n\"We thought it was important to get everyone on board early on and make sure that cities have maximum flexibility,\" Brandes said.\n\nDuncan said the city's attorneys are meeting this week to see how, if at all, the new law would affect the contract Tampa signed with the four scooter companies.\n\nIn order to try to crack down on the haphazard parking that plagues many cities, Tampa requires scooters to be placed in pre-determined corrals every day. People can then ride the scooter to whatever location they choose and park it anywhere that isn't blocking walkways and traffic.\n\nDuncan said the city had permitted 17 corrals as of Tuesday afternoon, but is approving more each day. That means people can expect to see the number of scooters and the variety of locations grow over the next couple weeks.\n\nCollin Sherwin, 41, took a Bird scooter Tuesday from his home near Hyde Park to his office downtown. The 2.3 mile trip cost him $6.11 \u2014 only a dollar or so less than an Uber.\n\nSherwin said his trips in other cities, like Austin and San Diego, were cheaper. The scooters cost $1 to start, but then vary on how much they charge per minute. Sherwin said he's paid around 15 cents a minute previously, but the cost Tuesday came to around 29 cents a minute, according to his receipt.\n\nEven though a scooter doesn't save him much money and takes twice as long as an Uber (16 minutes opposed to 8), Sherwin said he still would prefer to scooter to work, if the weather was good.\n\nSherwin, who gave up his car in 2017, said it's more fun and theoretically a cheaper option than taking a rideshare. But the main reason he prefers his bike or a scooter rental is that he feels more connected to his neighborhood with those than he does in a car.\n\n\"When I'm on my bike, I see the signs for a cool happy hour or an upcoming event you might miss,\" Sherwin said. \"The advantage with the scooter is I'm not sweating when I get to work.

When he extended his railroad line to Tampa in 1884, only about 700 people lived in the area.\n\nBy the time of Plant\u2019s death in 1899, he had amassed a railroad and steamship system, Huban said, that stretched from Prince Edward Island in Canada to Puerto Rico and Honduras. He built eight hotels in Florida, including locations in Winter Park and Punta Gorda.

In that pre-Civil War era, the trip was lengthy: Traveling to Jacksonville often meant taking a train, going on a horse-drawn carriage and ending the journey in a canoe.\n\nAt the time, Huban said, the state had a land grant program that gave developers acres in exchange for train track laid within certain areas.

But that was about two weeks\u2019 pay for a hotel employee, who would have earned about 40 to 60 cents per day.\n\nThe hotel remained open only for about 40 years, from 1891 to 1932. It was only fully occupied in 1898, the start of the Spanish-American War. It was then that about 30,000 troops came to Tampa and staged at the hotel before journeying to Cuba to fight the war. The hotel welcomed Theodore Roosevelt, before he became president, and American Red Cross founder Clara Barton. Those guests helped the structure earn its designation as a National Historic Landmark.\n\nStephanie Carlos, 75, examines a photograph at Tampa University's Plant Hall.

In 1905, the city of Tampa bought the Tampa Bay Hotel and its 125 surrounding acres for $125,000, a fraction of the $2.5 million it cost Plant to build the structure.\n\nThe city ran the hotel until 1932, then it proposed that the recently founded university lease the building and preserve part of it as a museum.\n\n***\n\nThe minarets of the Henry B.

City code enforcement officials arrived, citing the tree crew for working without a permit while activists snapped photos. Eventually, police arrived to keep order and everyone safe from falling limbs.\n\nThe drama highlighted a battle emerging between cities like Tampa and state lawmakers in Tallahassee around this question: Do cities have any control over how trees are removed?\n\nOne of the law's architects, state Rep. Anthony Sabatini, a Howey-in-the-Hills Republican, released a letter last week asserting that local governments had zero role in determining if a tree is dangerous.\n\n\"The designation of a tree as 'dangerous' is made solely by the arborist or landscape architect in their professional opinion and expertise, and is not to be supplemented, controlled or effected in any way by a local government,\" Sabatini wrote.\n\nCity Attorney Gina Grimes has a different take. She said the city will follow the law, but needs documentation from a certified arborist or landscape architect documented a tree poses a danger to people or property.\n\n\"We need to have the documents. We can't force them to give them to us. But if we don't have them, then we have to assume they're removing it illegally,\" Grimes said.\n\nJonathan Lee, the certified arborist who evaluated the trees on the Gandy property on behalf on an unidentified developer, has yet another interpretation. He says the law doesn't allow him to certify a tree is dangerous, but only to assess the risk level. The decision whether to remove a tree is left up to the property owner.\n\n\"If someone thinks a healthy tree that hangs over their children's bedroom is dangerous, that's up to them,\" Lee said.\n\nIt's the latest salvo in a ongoing dispute between property owners and environmentalists over the city's touted tree canopy that has raged for years. Before the new law took effect July 1, builders and homeowners complained that city regulations were too stringent. Advocates resisted changing the city's early 1970s ordinance, which they said protected Tampa's trees from being cut down for redevelopment. The two sides reached a compromise in April only to have their work nullified by the state.\n\nBut city officials say they're going to enforce the law they say they still control. They cited the tree removal company, Tampa's Miller & Sons, for working without permits. The property is also zoned commercial general \u2014 not residential \u2014 making it fall outside of the law's scope, which only regulates residential properties, Grimes said.\n\nThe case is now headed to a code enforcement special magistrate. And she said the Gandy cutting is a \"poor example\" of the new law, saying she didn't see proper documentation from Lee.\n\nLee disagrees, saying said he conducted a thorough evaluation of the property's trees and recommended that three grand oaks in good condition remain in place. He says the city has been aware of the cuttings for some time and is acting out of pique, misrepresenting his findings.\n\n\"They're upset that they've lost their power,\" Lee said.\n\nChelsea Johnson, who founded the tree advocacy group that was instrumental in brokering a compromise with builders, said she was angry that the city doesn't have any process in place to stop tree cuttings that may be illegal or without proper documentation.\n\n\"Unfortunately, you can't glue them back together,\" Johnson said. \"The city needs to step up to bat to defend our canopy. No tree is safe in Tampa.\"\n\nCounty property appraiser records show a St. Pete-based LLC, Life O'Reilly MHP, as the parcel's owner. Lee said the LLC's owner is working with a developer, who he declined to name. An attempt to rezone the property to allow for 80 residential units and 700-square-feet of office space was shot down by City Council in June, although that decision can still be appealed, Grimes said.\n\nMark Bentley, the attorney who represented the developer who previously had a contract on the property before City Council in June, told the Times Tuesday that he couldn't provide any information on ownership. That developer, Blue Line Residential, LLC, no longer has a contract on the property.\n\nLife O'Reilly, which listed a St. Petersburg P.O Box as an address, couldn't be reached for comment.\n\nMeanwhile, Joe Chillura, the author of the city's original tree ordinance, cheered council members Bill Carlson and John Dingfelder, who asked Grimes to explore joining other cities in challenging the law in court. Carlson said a legal resolution is a better avenue to fight than trying to change Tallahassee's mind by political persuasion.\n\n\"They're inhibiting American democracy by preventing people from living the way they want to in their own communities,\" Carlson said.\n\nEditor's note: Attorney Mark Bentley represented Blue Line Residential, LLC before the Tampa City Council in June.

The city has invited all of its international voters \u2014 about 4,000 people \u2014 to use the app in the May 2019 election.\n\nThe idea of digital voting has been met with skepticism from some elections security experts, but Denver officials say it could make life easier for a limited set of voters.\n\n\u201cThis pilot enables us to offer that convenience for our military and overseas citizens who have the most difficult time voting and participating in the democratic process here at home,\u201d said Deputy Elections Director Jocelyn Bucaro.\n\nSolving two problems?\n\nThe system could solve two problems for Denver Elections.\n\nFirst, it replaces older technology that\u2019s already in use. Under federal law, governments must provide a digital voting option to overseas voters. Denver has for several years offered a website that voters can use to mark ballots. It produces a PDF that is sent through a web service or over email.\n\nRELATED: National popular vote bill passes key test in Colorado House\n\n\u201cIt generally gets sent via email, which is not the most secure method,\u201d Bucaro said. Elections technology expert Maurice Turner agreed, saying that email and other earlier technologies are \u201cvery scary words\u201d to security professionals.\n\nDigital voting also could help the city meet tight deadlines. Denver\u2019s elections usually involve a second round of voting \u2014 the runoff election \u2014 about a month after Election Day. That\u2019s not much time to count votes, print ballots and mail them abroad.\n\nSecurity threats\n\nWest Virginia voters used the app in a similar pilot test for the 2018 elections, with about 144 voters participating.\n\nThe idea was met with some enthusiasm, but it still faced concerns about security. It\u2019s widely accepted that voting on paper is more secure than digital voting, since paper records are easier to audit and harder to change. Denver\u2019s main voting systems rely on paper ballots.\n\nDenver\u2019s pilot will use Voatz, the same Boston-based company as the West Virginia test. Voatz uses phones\u2019 biometric features, such as face identification and fingerprints. Users have to upload a 10-second video of themselves and a picture of their photo ID to register.\n\nAfter they\u2019re submitted, votes are stored with blockchain technology, according to Voatz. In other words, they\u2019re distributed across multiple servers in a way that is supposedly unchangeable. It\u2019s the same idea behind bitcoin and other cryptocurrency.\n\nBut blockchain also comes with another threat: If attackers ever break the encryption on Voatz\u2019s voting files, they could reveal how people voted, according to Maurice Turner, senior technologist for the Center for Democracy & Technology. It could take years or decades, but sooner or later it will happen, he said.\n\n\u201cIn America, we strongly value the secrecy of the ballot, and that\u2019s something that cannot be guaranteed with the current technology,\u201d Turner said.\n\nVoatz says it has taken steps to minimize the risk. The company keeps its blockchain ledgers on private servers rather than distributing them publicly, as cryptocurrencies do, Turner said. In other words, attackers may not have a copy of the encrypted files to hack.\n\nAccessible voting\n\nAmber McReynolds, Denver\u2019s former elections director, said that no technology is completely secure. But mobile voting could be worthwhile as a limited option for some voters, according to McReynolds, who helped launch the Voatz pilot in Denver.\n\n\u201cThe reality is, not every voter can vote on a paper ballot without assistance,\u201d said McReynolds, now the executive director of the National Vote at Home Institute. Blind people, for example, may need help filling out a paper ballot. \u201cGiven that reality, we have to continue to look for ways to provide voters that need it with options that are secure.\u201d\n\nThe Voatz pilot is free to the city. It\u2019s funded by Tusk Philanthropies, with help from the National Cybersecurity Center.\n\n\u201cIf the pilot is successful, we\u2019re hoping other cities in Colorado that fall under home-rule might consider using it in some of their local elections,\u201d Bucaro said.\n\nTurner, the technology expert, said it\u2019s worthwhile for cities to experiment with Voatz and other applications. \u201cAt least for the (overseas and military) voters, their options weren\u2019t particularly secure to begin with,\u201d he said. The outcomes of experiments like this will help officials respond to the inevitable demands for digital voting, he said.\n\nSo far, about 80 people have signed up for the pilot.", "title": "Denver will allow smartphone voting for thousands of people (but probably not you)", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Denver']"}, {"id": 228, "city": "['Denver']", "url": "https://www.denverpost.com/2019/02/14/denver-teachers-strike-agreement-reached/", "text": "Denver\u2019s first teachers strike in 25 years will come to an end after a record-setting, all-night bargaining session produced a new compensation deal shortly before dawn Thursday that labor leaders say will help better retain the district\u2019s educators.\n\nThe Denver Classroom Teachers Association initiated the strike Monday, decrying Denver Public Schools\u2019 incentive-based pay system and seeking better wages and more dependable financial advancement for the city\u2019s career teachers.\n\nThe walkout by more than 2,600 educators over the last three days left Denver\u2019s schools short-staffed and preschools classes canceled, with substitutes and district administrators filling in, and complaints from students in local high schools that they were being shown movies, given crosswords and otherwise not doing much learning.\n\nThe new deal sees DPS putting forward an additional $23.1 million toward teacher compensation, gives average raises of 11.7 percent next year and establishes a new salary schedule that starts at $45,800 a year and tops out at $100,000 annually.\n\nBoth the union and the district hailed the bargain struck early Thursday.\n\n\u201cThis is a victory for Denver kids and their parents and our teachers,\u201d said Rob Gould, the union\u2019s lead negotiator. \u201cEducators in Denver Public Schools now have a fair, predictable, transparent salary schedule. We\u2019re happy to get back to work.\u201d\n\nDPS Superintendent Susana Cordova said she was pleased by the \u201ccollaborative way we worked together.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere was a recognition that we share many areas of agreement, and we worked hard to listen and find common ground on the few areas where we had different perspectives,\u201d she said.\n\nUnion negotiators put forth what turned out to be their final proposal at 5:30 a.m. Thursday \u2014 DPS\u2019s longest-ever bargaining session had been underway since 10:30 a.m. Wednesday \u2014 and district leaders broke for about 25 minutes to review it.\n\n\u201cWe really only have one change recommended,\u201d Cordova said upon her return. \u201cWe\u2019d like to add a signature line to the proposal.\u201d\n\nCordova and Henry Roman, the union\u2019s president, sat beside each other as they signed off on the agreement and hugged, drawing applause from the teachers and administrators gathered in the basement of the Denver Central Library just after 6 a.m.\n\n\u201cWe are recommending now to our members that we officially end the strike,\u201d Gould said.\n\nBecause the negotiations had stretched all night, the union had not called off the strike, now technically in its fourth day. But Cordova said teachers are welcome back in the classroom Thursday.\n\n\u201cIf you want to come in, as soon as you can, come in,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019d love to have you back in the schools.\u201d\n\nCordova clarified that teachers who do not report to their classrooms on Thursday will have to take an unpaid day off \u2014 as they already have been this week during the strike.\n\nDPS\u2019s preschool programs, however, will remain closed another day.\n\nThe agreement still must be ratified by a vote of the Denver Classroom Teachers Association\u2019s full membership, then approved by the Denver Board of Education.\n\nHighlights of the deal, according to union and district officials, include:\n\nAn average 11.7 percent increase in base salary next year\n\nA \u201ctransparent\u201d 20-step salary schedule that starts at $45,800 a year and tops out at $100,000 for teachers with 20 years experience and a doctorate\n\nFull cost-of-living increases in the second and third years of the agreement\n\nThe ability to use professional development units \u2014 free in-district courses offered to advance teachers\u2019 education \u2014 to move up lanes on the salary schedule\n\nAn end to bonuses for senior DPS administrators\n\nAn additional $23.1 million in funding for teacher compensation\n\nThe deal also included a significant compromise on the contentious issue of educator incentives, with the union accepting the district\u2019s increased $3,000 retention bonus for teachers in the 30 highest-priority schools \u2014 if a collaborative research study is conducted to determine whether the much-debated incentives work to retain Denver\u2019s quality teachers.\n\n\u201cWe are thankful that both sides were able to come together after 15 months of bargaining to ensure our educators have a transparent salary schedule with a professional base salary scale and less reliance on unpredictable bonuses that disrupt our schools,\u201d Roman said in a statement.\u201d\n\nThe annual incentives agreed upon include:\n\nA $750 bonus for teachers in 10 distinguished schools\n\n$2,000 incentives for hard-to-staff positions and teachers working at Title I schools\n\nThe $3,000 incentive for educators in the 30 highest-priority schools\n\nA $1,000 of tuition reimbursement, maxing out at $6,000 over a career\n\nCordova called the proposal a strong investment in both teacher base pay and incentives.\n\nSleeping on the floor\n\nWhile many teachers called it a night after the session hit the midnight mark, the room had been packed the previous day as educators awaited their fate.\n\nDuring a particularly long lull waiting for both parties to come back to the table in the downtown library basement, 72-year-old DPS math teacher Kathleen Braun curled up on the floor under her seat for a quick power nap.\n\nThe more-than-19-hour bargaining session was the longest DPS negotiation on record.\n\nThe exhaustion of never-ending bargaining sessions, picketing and worrying about students was nothing new for Braun, who has now endured three DPS strikes in her lifetime \u2014 in 1969, 1994 and this week.\n\nBraun said she didn\u2019t strike for herself.\n\n\u201cI would make less than $200 at this point out of these deals,\u201d Braun said, with the imprint of her jacket zipper still visible on her face from her snooze. \u201cThis is for the next generation of teachers and those thinking of becoming teachers. One day, they will replace me, and I won\u2019t be sleeping on the floor of bargaining sessions anymore.\u201d\n\nGov. Jared Polis, who had declined to intervene ahead of the strike, praised the deal struck by DPS and the teachers union on Thursday.\n\n\u201cDenver\u2019s kids are the biggest winners in today\u2019s agreement,\u201d he said in a statement, \u201cand I think everyone is relieved that the strike is over and students and teachers will be back in school working together to build a brighter future for themselves and our community.\u201d\n\nMore than 2,600 Denver educators have hit the streets this week, along with supporters and some of their students, in the name of fair wages.\n\nThe issue at the core of the pay dispute, and 15 months of failed negotiations, is a compensation system called ProComp with a complicated history dating back to the 1990s.\n\nDenver\u2019s teachers union has been looking to secure the district\u2019s educators better and more reliable pay increases \u2014 rather than the bonuses at the heart of DPS\u2019s incentive-based ProComp system \u2014 as those teachers advance through their careers.\n\nThe district wanted to ensure any system was financially sustainable in the future.\n\nEven prior to this week\u2019s resumption of bargaining, the two sides had reached a point where they both proposed the same starting base salary for teachers: $45,800 a year. But other areas of contention remained, namely the DPS reliance on bonuses tied to working in high-poverty schools or student achievement.\n\nNegotiations heat up\n\nAs the Jan. 18 expiration of the ProComp contract grew closer, bargaining sessions between Denver Public Schools and the Denver Classroom Teachers Association heated up, with some ending in tears and squabbles, with representatives of both sides exhausted and frustrated.\n\nThe union voted on Jan. 22 to authorize a strike after its negotiations with DPS failed to secure a new contract governing educator compensation through the ProComp system. At the time, the two sides were about $8 million apart in their respective compensation proposals.\n\nOnce the union authorized a strike, DPS officials formally asked Polis to intervene, a move that delayed any strike until the state government weighed its options. The governor ultimately declined to step in \u2014 something that could have further delayed a strike by up to 180 days.\n\nAfter Polis made his decision last week, union officials declared they\u2019d strike on Monday, setting the stage for a final burst of bargaining. Representatives of DPS and the teachers met on Friday night and much of Saturday afternoon.\n\nSaturday\u2019s 11th-hour bargaining session grew increasingly contentious as union representatives rejected a new DPS proposal that would cut 150 central office jobs in an effort to free up $20 million to help with teacher pay. But it also increased incentives to teachers working in high-poverty schools, which has been a sticking point with the union.\n\nThe union representatives walked out on DPS negotiators Saturday night, announcing they would not meet with the district against until Tuesday \u2014 and that the strike would begin Monday.\n\nThe district and union returned to the bargaining table on Tuesday following a day of picketing and student walkouts in support of their teachers. The two sides met for more than 12 hours at the Denver Central Library, trading proposals and meeting in private to go over them.\n\nFollowing Tuesday night\u2019s session, Cordova expressed optimism, saying, \u201cWe can certainly see a pathway forward.\u201d\n\nCordova and Henry Roman, the union\u2019s president, followed up with a joint statement saying the two sides had \u201cworked in good faith to find common ground.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe exchanged proposals that are moving us closer and are hopeful that we will get to an agreement soon,\u201d they said. \u201cHowever, we need a little more time to resolve the outstanding issues.\u201d\n\nWednesday\u2019s negotiation session hit the ground running with the district responding to the union\u2019s late Tuesday proposal. As DPS unveiled its latest plan, teachers in the audience \u2014 who normally chant protest songs during breaks and occasionally heckle the district during bargaining talks \u2014 clapped and snapped their fingers in approval.\n\nThe union said it didn\u2019t have questions about the district\u2019s proposal, which came closer to the union in ways educators were able to move across their pay scale and earn professional development credits that could contribute toward their salary.", "title": "Denver Public Schools, union reach tentative agreement to end city\u2019s first teachers strike in 25 years", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Denver']"}, {"id": 229, "city": "['Denver']", "url": "https://www.denverpost.com/2019/08/04/denver-urban-farming-growing/", "text": "It was 8:15 Tuesday morning and the greenhouse was just waking up for the day.\n\nSpurred by an electrical panel that serves as its brain, its roof vents had popped open, letting in the cool, morning air.\n\nMeanwhile, the human staff of Altius Farms was already busy doing its work.

Altius is farming in the heart of Denver at 2500 Lawrence St. Its 7,000-square-foot greenhouse sits atop (and helps supply) chic sushi restaurant Uchi and is the visual centerpiece of sustainability-focused condo project S*Park.\n\nThe greenhouse is a shimmering glass example of the growing urban farming trend that is now setting down deeper roots in Denver, both in new projects like the soon-to-be-completed Lakehouse tower near Sloan\u2019s Lake and in historic city anchors like Larimer Square.\n\nS*Park was a Denver Housing Authority property before Westfield Co. bought the land it sits on and two other parcels for $7 million. Part of the deal required Westfield to preserve a community garden on the property. The company has done that. Herbert, formerly in the Air Force Reserve, is looking for a fellow veteran to tend to that outdoor plot which was planted earlier this summer. Westfield has also gone beyond that directive by bringing in Altius as one of the marquee tenants in the 91-unit community.\n\nWestfield partner Jonathan Alpert said the goal at S*Park was to find tenant businesses that matched with its sustainable design and mission. Other businesses on the block include a juice bar, a yoga studio and a forthcoming bakery.\n\nAltius plays more than one role there.\n\nThe development is dotted with metal tubs residents can use as their own garden beds, with Herbert and crew offering help with cultivation techniques. Altius is establishing a community-supported agriculture or CSA program where S*Park residents and people from across the metro area can subscribe and share in some of what\u2019s harvested as long as they are willing to come pick it up.\n\n\u201cI think all of the communities we build and are involved in are focused on what\u2019s next,\u201d Alpert said. \u201cThat was always the goal, to make it easy for people to live this lifestyle in the heart of the city.\u201d\n\nFor Christi Turner, S*Park\u2019s focus on sustainability is no fringe perk. Turner, who is renting a studio unit owned by a friend, is the founder of Scraps, a bike-powered compost pick-up service focused on the heart of Denver. S*Park provides her with easy access to her customers and proximity to like-minded businesses like Altius.

Where Altius is a startup \u2014 S*Park is its first urban farm, though another, larger project is in the works, Herbert said \u2014 Agriburbia has been involved in urban farming for a decade, working on projects across the U.S. and other countries. Redmond believes Lakehouse, where a rooftop farm was part of the plan from the beginning, is the first project of its kind in the country.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not designed to feed everybody in the building. It\u2019s designed to educate everybody. It\u2019s designed to be part of a broader wellness program,\u201d Redmond said. \u201cThe main thing was to get food growing on a brand new building and to make it part of the culture. It was a joyous occasion when we harvested radishes there last week.\u201d\n\nUrban farming has already risen to prominence in some coastal cities, aided, in the case of trend standard-bearer San Francisco, at least by tax subsidies. But real estate trend watchers expect it to goes mainstream across the country as people get more in tune with where their food comes from and demand more fresh, healthy options.\n\nIn a trends report published in November, researchers with global real estate services firm Cushman & Wakefield wrote, \u201cWe expect indoor cropping operations to be a major growth industry in the years ahead.\u201d Projects mentioned in the report include a 26-tower indoor garden at Chicago\u2019s O\u2019Hare International Airport supplying herbs, greens and more to airport restaurants that serve upward of 10,000 people every day. Indoor farming options are viewed as particularly positive because of their low water use, and year-round production, per the report.\n\nIn Denver, Cushman & Wakefield broker Joey Trinkle is on the lookout for industrial space to accommodate Castle Rock company Farmbox Foods. Farmbox converts old shipping containers into self-contained mobile hydroponic and aquaponic farms. It wants access to rail so it can send it products to any metro area where it might find clients, Trinkle said.\n\nWith competition for industrial space in Denver fierce right now, Trinkle said he isn\u2019t aware of many other urban farming startups looking for space. The big players in the industrial market from a food perspective remain online retailers looking to speed grocery delivery to customers and meal-in-a-box delivery companies like Blue Apron.\n\n\u201cI think we may start to see more sort cues of that sort of thing shifting into Denver,\u201d he said, \u201cbut none that I am familiar with at this point.\u201d\n\nOne of the most storied blocks in Denver \u2014 historic Larimer Square \u2014 is embracing urban farming. Earlier this summer, property manager Urban Villages cordoned off the roof of the block\u2019s six-story parking garage on Market Street, built garden boxes and planted 100 plus varieties of plants including more than 50 types of vegetable. It eliminated more than 90 money-making parking spaces in the process.\n\nThe company partnered with Larimer Square owner Jeff Hermanson in 2018 to unveil controversial plans to build new, tall buildings along the square, with aims to bring affordable housing and a hotel to the block. Those plans, which would require City Council sign off because Larimer Square is a protected historic district, are up in the air but rooftop gardens, also part of that initial proposal, was something Urban Villages CEO Grant McCargo decided could not wait.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a global food crisis. The world doesn\u2019t know it,\u201d said McCargo, who also heads up Urban Villages sister company Bio-Logical Capital and recently helped bring the eco-friendly Slow Food Nations festival to the square.\n\nMcCargo said the challenges brought on by climate change mean people need to be growing food everywhere, including on rooftops downtown. \u201cThis is not a for-profit venture up here,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is for our education so we can plan for the reimagination (of Larimer Square.)\u201d\n\nThe operation is being managed by Mike Spade, a New York City native who previously worked on a rooftop farm atop a hospital building at his alma mater, Stony Brook University. The roof is open for public tours on weekdays, with Saturdays being added soon, Spade said. He is exploring additional possibilities for public education and agrotourism on the roof. All food grown there is being given away.\n\nUrban agriculture is not a new concept in Denver. The nonprofit Denver Urban Gardens manages dozens of community gardens across the metro area where people can rent plots. In the Elyria-Swansea neighborhood, GrowHaus is nearing its 10-year anniversary. That nonprofit operates a hydroponic and aquaponic farm to stock its fresh food market (where prices are set on a sliding scale) and fill subscription food boxes as it strives to support a community-driven, neighborhood-based food system that is accessible to people of all income levels.\n\nBut things are clearly growing too new levels. Earlier this year, the nonprofit Focus Points Family Resource Center was awarded a $100,000 state grant to plan future community gardens in the Elyria-Swansea and Globeville neighborhoods. Colorado State University is preparing to build a food and agriculture innovation center as part of its three-building campus at the National Western Complex. While it could never replace traditional farming and rural food production in Colorado or elsewhere, Tom Vilsack, the former U.S. secretary of agriculture and Iowa governor now advising CSU on its National Western project, said urban farming does have a role to play in the future.\n\nIn part, \u201cit provides opportunities for community development, it provides business opportunities and opportunities for job growth,\u201d Vilsack said.\n\nKayla Birdsong, executive director of GrowHaus, is all for more locally grown produce. With more people moving into Denver all the time, there are that many more people who need, fresh healthy food. But as entrepreneurs and for-profit businesses get in on the act \u2014 each of which competes with her nonprofit organization \u2014 she hopes operators will continue to look for ways to give back, whether it be donating extra food or providing jobs in the neighborhood like GrowHaus does.\n\n\u201cThere is a responsibility in the business community that is in it for profit to very intentionally map out their road to contributing to their communities directly and ensuring that they are actively working towards equitable food access, especially in neighborhoods that struggle so much with food insecurity every day,\u201d she said.", "title": "Denver urban farming trend grows from a Sloan\u2019s Lake condo tower to a Larimer Square parking garage", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Denver']"}, {"id": 230, "city": "['Baltimore']", "url": "https://wtop.com/local/2019/09/investigation-urban-poor-hit-hardest-as-the-planet-heats-up/", "text": "In Baltimore and around the world, in communities rich and poor, downtown and in the suburbs, weather disasters loom. And experts are using language ever more dire.\n\nBALTIMORE (AP) \u2014 Heat radiates from the asphalt and concrete that cover the streets, the sidewalks, the alleys, even the tiny yards behind the homes in the East Baltimore neighborhood of McElderry Park. Trees are scarce. And air doesn\u2019t move much when it comes up against block after block of rowhouses.\n\nSo as a dangerous 11-day heat wave tormented the city in July, the hottest month ever recorded on the planet, fewer and fewer residents were going outside.\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t even put your head out the door,\u201d said Tammy Jackson, 48, on a day when the temperature outside hit 100 degrees Fahrenheit and 92 degrees in her home. \u201cThis is too much. Oh Lord, this is too much.\u201d\n\nBut it is going to get worse. In McElderry Park and around the world, in communities rich and poor, downtown and in the suburbs, weather disasters loom. And experts are using language ever more dire.\n\n____\n\nThis article was provided to The Associated Press by the University of Maryland\u2019s Howard Center and Capital News Service. To read a full version of this four-part series go to: https://cnsmaryland.org/interactives/summer-2019/code-red/index.html\n\n____\n\nAverage annual temperatures in Baltimore have gone up more than 3 degrees over the last century, nearly twice as much as the rest of the country.\n\nMore and more people, including Del. Robbyn Lewis, who represents parts of East Baltimore, are replacing the words \u201cclimate change\u201d with stronger language.\n\n\u201cWe are,\u201d she said, \u201cin an emergency.\u201d\n\nCities, crowded and paved-over, already feel the impact, with poorer air quality and streets, highways and bridges damaged by storms. But certain neighborhoods will continue to feel the effects of extreme temperatures more than others.\n\nResearchers at Portland State University in Oregon and the Science Museum of Virginia have mapped these areas, called urban heat islands, and data shows that temperatures here and in surrounding neighborhoods can run 8 degrees hotter than in communities that have more trees and less pavement. McElderry Park, which despite its lyrical name offers little green space, is one of these.\n\nResidents in the hottest areas have higher rates of chronic illnesses affected by heat, including asthma and COPD. In hot weather, emergency medical calls for some chronic conditions increase. The rate of emergency medical calls for cardiac arrest and congestive heart failure, for example, nearly double when the heat index hits 103 degrees.\n\nHouseholds in the city\u2019s hottest areas have lower incomes, which means the residents don\u2019t have the resources to move out.\n\nThis is true across the country. In a majority of the country\u2019s most populous cities, people with lower incomes typically lived in the hottest areas, an investigation by journalists from NPR and the University of Maryland found.\n\nSacoby Wilson, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Health, says people in low-income neighborhoods walk more, ride more buses and drive fewer cars, so they contribute less to climate change. And yet they are more vulnerable to dying in extreme heat.\n\n\u201cEnvironmental justice and climate change,\u201d Wilson said, \u201care inextricably linked.\u201d\n\nRowhouses, Baltimore\u2019s signature architecture, trap heat and stay hot even when the heat eases on summer nights. Crime rates are higher, so many people won\u2019t put an air-conditioning unit in a first-floor window for fear of break-ins.\n\nThe problems are not new. Many stem from historical segregationist zoning and lending policies that for decades limited where black citizens could live.\n\nDuring an 11-day July heat wave, Baltimore\u2019s health department put out press releases advising citizens to drink water, cut back on outdoor activities and find relief in designated air-conditioned cooling centers. Inside the rowhouses, even those with an air-conditioning window unit, the heat simmered.\n\nReporters from the University of Maryland\u2019s Howard Center for Investigative Journalism and Capital News Service placed sensors that record heat and humidity inside several homes in McElderry Park and nearby neighborhoods. Those sensors recorded temperatures that reached as high as 97 degrees and heat index values of 119 degrees.\n\nIn some homes, those readings showed that it was hotter inside than outside.\n\nAt 7 p.m. Friday, the heat index in Baltimore hit 103 degrees. Inside the bedroom Stephanie Pingley\u2019s niece shares with one of Pingley\u2019s three sons, it was 13 degrees hotter, with a heat index of 116 degrees. All of her boys have asthma.\n\nBy Saturday, the heat index inside the second-floor apartment of Michael Thomas and Alberta Wilkerson hit 112 degrees. A fan pushed hot air around. Thomas, 61, has emphysema. Wilkerson, 49, has had a heart attack.\n\n\u201cJust living through it,\u201d Thomas said.\n\nOn Sunday, Solomon Simmons, who is retired from a job at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, went to Hope Community Church, where he is a deacon. \u201cWe had trouble getting the church cool,\u201d he said.\n\nSimmons, 71, will not put an air-conditioning unit in a first floor window facing the street \u201cbecause of security.\u201d But especially for children, older residents and people coping with chronic diseases, air conditioning is the answer.\n\nTammy Jackson, who has asthma, said she had to stop cooking dinner one July evening when the heat made it hard for her to breathe. The next day, she told her husband, \u201cBaby, I can\u2019t cook until I get AC.\u201d\n\nTwenty people have died of heat-related illnesses in Maryland so far this year, three of them in Baltimore, according to data through Aug. 28.\n\nHistorically, the Baltimore area has averaged about six days a year when the heat index exceeded 100 degrees, according to new research from the Union of Concerned Scientists and the University of Idaho.\n\nIf no action is taken to reduce carbon emissions, by mid-century that figure will rise to more than 37 days annually, according to the researchers.\n\nAs temperatures in Baltimore reached 100 on July 20, most everyone around the city was staying inside. \u201cThis is the quietest the block ever been,\u201d Tammy Jackson said. \u201cI can\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\nBut city life continued despite the heat. A team of paramedics was called to an East Baltimore block when a resident found a man she didn\u2019t know passed out on her front steps.\n\nThe paramedics revived the man, who apparently had overdosed, with a dose of Narcan. He stood up and wandered off, rejecting advice he go to the hospital.\n\n___\n\nNPR reporters Meg Anderson, Nora Eckert and Sean McMinn and University of Maryland reporters Jake Gluck, Jane Gerard, Roxanne Ready, Theresa Diffendal and Sean Mussenden contributed to this story.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 The Associated Press.

The insights reveal some striking trends: Crime declined when tree canopy coverage went up. Temperatures spiked in areas with fewer trees, and with more trees, housing values increased.\n\nWith concern growing about climate change and rapid worldwide urbanization, city forests have emerged as one solution to a host of social and environmental challenges.

What the headlines don\u2019t often share is that the city is a model for green management, one that has gained attention as a successful urban forest experiment.\n\nFrom his headquarters office, Erik Dihle drives into what has become one of the most monitored forests in the United States.\n\nHe begins to point out the trees: There is a tulip poplar, as big as the ones George Washington planted at Mount Vernon. There are the blossoming cherries, with a cotton-candy display that rivals their famous compatriots down the road at the Tidal Basin in Washington, D.C. And there is a white oak, Maryland\u2019s state tree, with its branches gnarling horizontally for yards.\n\n\u201cThis is a good-size one,\u201d he says, getting out of his truck to pace the area of shade created by the tree\u2019s canopy. \u201cI\u2019d be surprised if it was less than 150 years old.\u201d\n\nA few blocks away, someone lays on a horn, and traffic begins to move along one of this city\u2019s main arteries. Construction vehicles beep as they repair an old municipal reservoir. And Mr. Dihle jumps back into his truck, ready to show more trees.\n\nMr. Dihle\u2019s forest is in the city. He is the arborist and the head of forestry for the city of Baltimore, which means he monitors all the trees here \u2013 those growing in shady parks, in metal grates along busy streets, in backyards, and in relatively untouched forest patches dotting the municipality. Together, these trees make up what is called the city\u2019s \u201curban forest,\u201d a type of ecosystem that is gaining attention at both the national and international levels among everyone from environmentalists to politicians, social justice advocates to corporations.\n\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff 'Between the tree canopy and the urban forestry here we are making a difference,' says Erik Dihle, arborist for the city of Baltimore. 'It all ties together. ... It ties into social equity, into climate adaption, everything.'\n\nWith concern growing about climate change and rapid worldwide urbanization, city forests have emerged as one widely touted solution to a host of social and environmental challenges. Municipalities from Barcelona, Spain; to Melbourne, Australia; to Chicago have put urban canopy coverage at the center of their long-term strategic plans. Community groups focusing on planting, maintaining, and saving trees have blossomed across the U.S. In 2015, the World Economic Forum\u2019s Global Agenda Council on the Future of Cities named increasing green canopy coverage as one of its top 10 urban initiatives.\n\nYet at the same time, the U.S. Forest Service, which in the past decade has also upped its focus on urban forests, has found that American cities are losing trees \u2013 and quickly.\n\nA Forest Service report published last year found that across the U.S., populated areas lost about 175,000 acres of trees per year between 2009 and 2014, or approximately 36 million trees per year. Forty-five states had a net decline in tree cover in these areas, with 23 of those states experiencing significant decreases. Meanwhile, urban regions showed a particular decline, along with an increase in what the researchers call \u201cimpervious surfaces\u201d \u2013 in other words, concrete.\n\nBut not, it turns out, in Baltimore.\n\nHere, the net tree canopy coverage has increased. Not by a lot, Mr. Dihle is quick to point out \u2013 only from 27% of the city\u2019s land coverage to 28% \u2013 and not because Baltimore hasn\u2019t lost trees. It has. But overall the tree canopy here has grown, which means that Mr. Dihle has found himself presiding over one of the more successful efforts in the U.S. to preserve and improve the urban forest.\n\nIt\u2019s become an improbable green model for cities around the world.\n\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff A tree stands in front of colorful row houses in the Reservoir Hill neighborhood of Baltimore. The city is a leader in mapping and protecting urban forests.\n\nThe intersection of trees and urban living\n\nTrees have been in cities, of course, for centuries. Documents from early New England settlements include rules and regulations about how residents should make use of trees growing on town commons. Many municipalities appointed tree wardens to make sure everyone followed the law. Even the modern concept of urban forestry has been around since the 1960s, when officials in the Johnson administration looked toward nature, and trees in particular, to help revitalize urban landscapes that they perceived to be crumbling.\n\nBut in recent years, scientists say, demographic trends have shifted attention toward the urban forest in a new way.\n\nAcross the world, there is a rapid and increasing movement of people from rural areas to cities. In 2009, the United Nations estimated that 3 million people worldwide moved to a city every week. By 2015 more than half of the world\u2019s population lived in urban areas, according to the U.N., with the number of city dwellers expected to grow from 3.9 billion to 6.7 billion by 2050.\n\nThe same is true in the U.S. More than 80% of Americans live in urban areas, even though cities account for only 3.6% of the country\u2019s landmass.\n\nAt the same time, new technology has let researchers better understand the urban ecosystem \u2013 not just how trees thrive or fail in a city, but how they intersect with humans.\n\n\u201cThey impact work productivity, wildlife habitats, air pollution removal, carbon sequestration, energy use,\u201d says David Nowak, senior scientist with the U.S. Forest Service who authored the recent national report on tree canopy loss. \u201cWe might as well work with the forests. Nature is giving us this amazing resource. ... We should be smart about this whole process and use nature to make our lives better.\u201d\n\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Trees are absent in front of mostly vacant row houses in the Old Goucher neighborhood, a low-income, high-crime area in Baltimore. Statistics show a correlation between the presence of trees and crime \u2013 areas with fewer trees have higher crime rates.\n\nMuch of the understanding of how, exactly, trees affect everything from climate to criminal justice stems from a technological breakthrough pioneered in Baltimore.\n\nFor decades, scientists recorded their data on paper, filling notebooks and filing cabinets. With the advent of computers, foresters were able to tabulate and analyze the information in a new way. By the 1990s, satellite imagery allowed governmental agencies such as NASA to produce visible images of Earth and to show on various scales where trees existed.\n\nBut there was a limit to those pictures, explains Morgan Grove, a scientist with the U.S. Forest Service who has worked in Baltimore since 1999. Because the data were recorded in pixels, not physical parcels, it was difficult to identify, say, the owner of a particular tree, or to compare what was happening from one city block to another.\n\nIn 2006, though, the Forest Service, working with researchers from the University of Vermont\u2019s spatial analysis lab, put together a new type of land cover map in Baltimore using a combination of aerial imagery, light-reflecting technology, and high-resolution landowner data. This novel approach not only allowed a closer look at trees, it also let scientists synchronize forest maps with other information that was also newly computerized and manipulable \u2013 everything from health records to census figures, crime statistics to property values.\n\n\u201cNow we can talk about trees and how they relate to other systems,\u201d Mr. Grove says. \u201cOur ability to combine data systems in novel ways \u2013 we couldn\u2019t do that 30 years ago.\u201d\n\nThe insights revealed some striking trends. Crime declined when tree canopy coverage went up. Temperatures spiked in areas with fewer trees, an effect known as a \u201cheat island,\u201d and with more trees, housing values increased.\n\nWith parcel-by-parcel data, city officials could see precisely where trees had been removed and where canopy had increased. They could zoom in on a particular block, or even a house, and see which trees existed there as well as the age, health, and size of the stock. They could also determine how much carbon sequestration, cooling effect, and crime mitigation any particular tree gave a city. And from there, researchers could put a dollar figure on a tree, an approach that fit a larger trend of environmentalists trying to show the value of natural resources in monetary terms.\n\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff 'Once you take a tree down, you replace it with another tree. The main goal is to increase the tree canopy in the city,' says Lawrence Wynter, an urban forester in Baltimore.\n\nCities around the country and world began implementing the technology and started to notice additional patterns. In London, for instance, officials found that in areas with greater tree canopy coverage residents took markedly fewer prescription antidepressants. One neighborhood in Chicago found that a tree initiative saved each resident nearly $100 in heating and cooling costs. In New York City, advocates armed with statistics about the financial impact of trees launched a hugely ambitious \u2013 and ultimately successful \u2013 effort to plant 1 million trees in the city within 10 years. Today, scientists in New York are using tree maps to show areas most in need: places where trees could help cool neighborhoods heavily populated with elderly, minority, and impoverished residents.\n\nAround the world, as scientists mapped more and more trees, they understood better how urban forests affect everything from land use to natural disaster mitigation.\n\n\u201cBaltimore was the first place where we did the whole city,\u201d Mr. Grove says. \u201cNow we have done the entire Chesapeake Bay watershed. We\u2019ve done the whole Northeastern U.S. It would cost some money, but it\u2019s possible to do the entire U.S. Which [would be] transformative.\u201d\n\nBaltimore, an improbable green model\n\nBaltimore is perhaps an unexpected model for green management. The city has not been building a reputation for governmental effectiveness recently: During the first week of May, Mayor Catherine Pugh resigned amid corruption allegations, while a week earlier a former city police officer was sentenced to nine years in prison for helping run a drug gang with other officers. National press about Baltimore, when there is any, tends to focus on the negative \u2013 the violent crime rate, the ingrained poverty, the struggles of its police force and school system.\n\nBut what the headlines don\u2019t often share is Baltimore\u2019s long-standing environmental focus. Sitting on the Chesapeake Bay, the city is headquarters for numerous researchers and environmental organizations studying and protecting the country\u2019s largest estuary. It was this work that led to the city\u2019s leading role in urban ecology.\n\nIn the late 1990s, scientists were trying to figure out how to reduce the amount of nitrogen in the bay. For years, agricultural runoff and urban pollution had been despoiling the ecosystem. Because of other research done in more rural areas, scientists believed that one solution was to plant trees alongside streams and inlets. But when they started testing, explains Mr. Grove, they discovered that, for a number of biological reasons, a better way to reduce nitrogen in the Chesapeake Bay was to plant trees throughout Baltimore.\n\nSoon, the National Science Foundation took interest in the work and funded what would end up being a 20-year ecological study in the city. It was one of the first big investments in urban ecology, Mr. Grove says, and the roots of the tree map initiative.\n\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff 'There\u2019s a mythology that people in urban environments don\u2019t like nature,' says Katie Lautar, executive director of Baltimore Green Space.\n\nNow Mr. Dihle, the city arborist, uses that tree map regularly. Along with the age, location, and species of trees, his department can harness the technology to note which of the city\u2019s 2.6 million trees need pruning, whether any are sick, and which neighborhoods are due for tree maintenance.\n\nThis way, he says, \u201cwe make sure those trees are not falling down in a storm, not becoming a nuisance to the neighborhood. ... We don\u2019t wait for it to be a complaint.\u201d\n\nNot only does this keep residents happy but it also maintains canopy coverage. Large, older trees have far more leaf span, and thus ecological impact, than newly planted trees.\n\n\u201cWe all love the new tree plantings,\u201d Mr. Dihle says. \u201cWe like to get our picture taken and there we are with the shovels and the schoolchildren all around. But when I got here the concern was the mortality rate: how many [of the new trees] are still alive four or five years later.\u201d\n\nUrban forest crusader\n\nMr. Dihle arrived in the city eight years ago. He had just retired from the U.S. Department of the Army, where he was a civilian in charge of managing the 12,000-tree Arlington National Cemetery. Some people were surprised when they heard that Mr. Dihle was planning to spend his retirement working for Baltimore, and in a position that, as Mr. Grove says, requires him to be able not only to cut down a tree and cut up a tree, but also to \u201cbe one of the most patient people in the world. And deal with disasters.\u201d\n\nBut with the laid-back vibe of his California upbringing, Mr. Dihle responds to questions about this with a shrug and a smile.\n\n\u201cI think I can make a difference,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd between the tree canopy and the status of urban forestry here, we are making a difference.\u201d\n\nHe moved to a neighborhood close enough to bike to forestry headquarters, the entrance of which is now graced by a sculpture of Dr. Seuss\u2019 Lorax wearing hiking sandals. Mr. Dihle says he found a city far different from what the headlines and reputation suggested. Baltimore had not only a deep scientific base, he says, but also great neighborhoods, a revitalizing downtown, and the sort of community activism that makes environmental innovation possible.\n\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff A tag on a willow oak in Wilson Woods indicates that it has been inventoried as part of a local effort to preserve the city\u2019s forested areas.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re at the forefront of a lot of green infrastructure,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have a lot to champion.\u201d\n\nAcross from his office desk is a stuffed raven \u2013 a reference to either hometown poet Edgar Allan Poe or the professional football team, depending on one\u2019s inclination \u2013 and a rubber rat, the tongue-in-cheek city mascot. Nearby are bumper stickers and posters for many of the city\u2019s environmental nonprofits. One of Mr. Dihle\u2019s jobs is to coordinate these different organizations. Together they work under the \u201cTreeBaltimore\u201d umbrella and use the city\u2019s tree map data to coordinate tree plantings and maintenance, neighborhood cleanups, and various other initiatives.\n\nThere is Blue Water Baltimore, which works to restore the quality of the city\u2019s various waterways. The Baltimore Orchard Project helps plant fruit trees in community gardens around the city. And Baltimore Green Space both works as a community land trust and helps preserve \u201cforest patches\u201d \u2013 usually small, and often overlooked, swaths of woodland that dot cities.\n\nAppreciation for a precious urban resource\n\nSpringfield Woods is not on Google maps. But walk to the end of Springfield Avenue, or across the street from the low slung, red brick Maplewood Apartment complex on St. Georges Avenue, and it is there: a cool bit of forest in the historically African American neighborhood of Wilson Park on the northwest side of Baltimore.\n\nButch Berry has spent most of his life going into Springfield Woods. When he was a kid in the 1960s, he remembers playing there, often by the stream that still babbles through the trees. When he came back to the family home in the early 2010s, after working as a cartoonist in Los Angeles, he was drawn to it again.\n\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Baltimore resident Butch Berry stands in a clearing in Springfield Woods, a patch of forest he and other neighbors help maintain.\n\nBut by then the woods were different. People dumped trash at the edge of the 3.5 acre parcel. A handful of homeless people had made a campsite in the middle. Poison ivy had snarled the underbrush. Mr. Berry asked around about whether anyone in the neighborhood association was doing anything to keep up the woods. Eventually, he started just picking up trash himself.\n\n\u201cI figured, what are they going to do \u2013 arrest me for picking up litter?\u201d he says with a laugh.\n\nLater, he reached out to Baltimore Green Space, to see if the group might help him take care of Springfield Woods. He had heard of the organization because it had recently gotten involved in trying to save another forest patch, Wilson Woods, a few blocks away.\n\nAs Katie Lautar, the group\u2019s executive director, describes it, area residents had contacted Baltimore Green Space because they heard that a landowner planned to mow down a vacant acre of old hardwood trees that residents had long used. Until then, Baltimore Green Space had mostly focused on community gardening projects.\n\nBut the idea of a city forest was intriguing. It was a situation, Ms. Lautar says, where people simply didn\u2019t see a natural resource in front of them.\n\n\u201cSometimes folks have, in the wider environmental world, a block about thinking of nature in urban spaces,\u201d she says. \u201cI say that as someone who grew up in Baltimore. I got my master\u2019s in environmental education and came back and I had never noticed these spaces.\u201d\n\nAfter a number of meetings with residents, who asked to know about the mini forests, she reached out to scientists who could help study the ecological impacts of forest patches and explore how people use them. The group discovered that not only did the forest patches provide important habitats for native species and significant cooling effects for surrounding homes, but they often played an important role in neighborhoods.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a mythology that people in urban environments don\u2019t like nature,\u201d Ms. Lautar says. The truth is that people use and love the woods. Their research found that the vast majority of some 80 forest patches in the city showed signs of human stewardship \u2013 trails, benches, or places where people had weeded. Or there was a person, like Mr. Berry, who had started picking up trash.\n\nMs. Lautar decided to use Baltimore Green Space\u2019s community activism model to protect these mini forests. Today, the group supports neighborhood \u201cforest stewards\u201d who take the lead in caring for woods.\n\nOn one recent morning, for instance, Charles Brown was working on the edge of the remaining half acre of Wilson Woods. Mr. Brown, a retired cab driver, comes by every few days to work on the trail, pull out invasive vines, or plant new seedlings.\n\nMelanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Federal Hill Park, which is filled with trees, overlooks the harbor in Baltimore.\n\n\u201cI used to drive by this every day and didn\u2019t notice it,\u201d he says. Now, it\u2019s one of the places in his neighborhood that gives him joy. \u201cIt\u2019s peaceful. You get a sense of accomplishment.\u201d He pauses and gives a wry smile known to gardeners everywhere. \u201cIf you ever finish anything.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Mr. Berry\u2019s Springfield Woods has become a showcase for urban forest patches. Since Baltimore Green Space began its partnership with him, volunteers from around the neighborhood and beyond have come into the woods to pull out the poison ivy, build trails, and haul out trash.\n\n\u201cWe found everything in here from a vacuum cleaner to an old gun,\u201d Mr. Berry says.\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. By signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy\n\nNow there are benches and clearings and a sign at the edge of the forest welcoming visitors. Mr. Berry and Baltimore Green Space have hosted events in the woods, including an edible hike, in which participants cook food harvested from the forest. When the group recently organized a \u201chaunted woods\u201d evening, more than 90 people attended. There is still trash, but much less of it, and Mr. Berry has watched as the same neighbors who once used the woods as a dump now yell at people throwing litter from their cars.\n\n\u201cBetween the tree canopy and the urban forestry here we are making a difference,\u201d says Mr. Dihle. \u201cIt all ties together. ...

Only a few attendees turned belligerent, hurling profanities and shaking their fists at the law enforcement officers. Several organizers called on the aggressors to back off, and tensions were defused.\n\nOn several occasions, the protesters were asked to kneel on the street, in honor of Floyd and others who died in police custody.\n\nA counter-demonstration of sorts took place overhead, as a single-engine airplane towing a banner circled the protesters in three-minute intervals. The banner read: \u201cWe love the police.

Following political blowback and the indictment of the St. Louis County executive who would have run the merged government, backers withdrew the proposal. But the problems that prompted it\u2014regional demographic and economic malaise, fiscal distress, and segregation\u2014aren\u2019t going away. Attempts to shake up the region\u2019s governance are likely to continue.\n\nSt. Louis is a rare \u201cindependent city\u201d\u2014not located within a county, that is, but existing as its own separate entity. Baltimore and some cities in Virginia are also organized this way, but few others. St. Louis was once part of St. Louis County. In 1876, however, city officials, unhappy with the county government, managed to push through a secession in which a newly enlarged city was carved away from the county. Practically speaking, the independent city of St. Louis was equivalent to a combined city-county government. In 1950, its peak population year, St. Louis was the eighth-largest city in the United States, with a population of 856,796, which even today would make it our 18th-largest municipality\u2014bigger than Seattle, Denver, or Boston. Its land area of 62 square miles exceeds those of San Francisco and the District of Columbia. For a long time, independent St. Louis thrived, and separation from the county looked like a smart move.\n\nBut after 1950, St. Louis fell into steep decline. Its population has shrunk to 302,838, a drop of 65 percent\u2014worse than Detroit\u2019s population loss. The region has stagnated, too; the population of the larger metro area fell slightly last year.\n\nOnce a major regional business center, St. Louis has seen a dramatic erosion of civic standing. Local giants like Anheuser-Busch, McDonnell-Douglas, and Ralston Purina were bought out and reduced their local presence. TWA was acquired by American Airlines, which eliminated its hub in St. Louis. Southwestern Bell (now part of a reassembled AT&T) moved to Texas. As Brian Feldman documented in Washington Monthly, St. Louis once had a thriving professional-services industry in sectors such as advertising that served national clients; today, its services firms mostly have local clients. True, St. Louis retains several Fortune 500 companies and a large financial-services industry base, boasts an elite private school in Washington University, and remains a center of plant sciences, as well as being part of a major region of almost 3 million people, with significant economic activity and serious cultural assets\u2014and the St. Louis Blues hockey team just won the Stanley Cup for the first time. Nonetheless, the city is clearly much less prominent than during its postwar heyday.\n\nRegional stagnation has exposed many other civic issues, such as heavy segregation and jurisdictional fragmentation. St. Louis County is dotted with 91 municipalities, most very small, and many fiscally distressed. A number have turned to abusive ticketing practices to raise funds. The county\u2019s problems blew up in Ferguson in 2014, where the police shooting of Michael Brown led to weeks of unrest. While state and federal investigations found the shooting justified, the resulting attention revealed many serious problems with how St. Louis suburbs were conducting business.\n\nMany observers believe that reorganizing local government is necessary. Some have advocated that the city of St. Louis rejoin the county and become an ordinary city again. Others argue for a full consolidation of government between the city and county, pointing to merged city-county governments like Nashville and Indianapolis as positive examples. Urban planners have long viewed regionalized government, including city-county mergers, as a holy grail of good governance.\n\nBetter Together, a plan created by local leaders and heavily funded by local billionaire Rex Sinquefield, would have recombined St. Louis city and county and merged their governments. The existing St. Louis municipalities would have continued to exist as \u201cmunicipal districts\u201d but would lose authority over police, courts, roads, and economic development, as well as chunks of their revenue streams. Fire and school districts would stay independent. The plan was touted as a money-saver that would generate significant efficiencies, allowing the elimination of the local earnings tax, a long-time Sinquefield priority. Backers planned to implement the merger through a citizen-initiated amendment of the Missouri state constitution, to be voted on statewide.\n\nMany aspects of this plan, which directly targeted abusive municipal police and courts, were well designed. Knowing that any kind of government merger is always hugely controversial, the planners took a light hand with their changes, not attempting to abolish existing municipalities completely.\n\nBut problems abounded. The projected savings were almost certainly a mirage. Unlike in corporate mergers, in government combinations municipal employees rarely lose their jobs or take pay cuts. In fact, the opposite is more likely\u2014that wages and benefits would increase. Indeed, backers pledged in advance not to lay anyone off. The plan to implement a statewide vote also gave opponents an opening to criticize the plan as undemocratic. And complaints arose from some minority-group leaders, worried that their electoral clout might be reduced, as well as from some city advocates, fearing a takeover by the much larger suburban voting base. The county executive, in fact, was slated to be the transitional mayor. That proved the plan\u2019s undoing, after he was indicted.\n\nGood reasons exist to question a city-county merger for St. Louis. These reorganizations consume immense civic time and attention that could be devoted to other priorities. The merger wouldn\u2019t save money. And unlike mergers in Indianapolis and Nashville, which happened more than 50 years ago, this plan would not combine an older city with growing suburbs, but rather, join an older city to suburbs that are themselves old and stagnant. To the extent that new suburban growth is occurring in St. Louis, it\u2019s farther out, in places like St. Charles County.\n\nNevertheless, merger talk continues. Backers have already said that they plan to resurrect the idea. St. Louis clearly faces regional demographic and economic challenges as well as acute problems with its micro-suburbs in St. Louis County. While a merger would not be a silver bullet, it might disrupt the status quo in a way that opens new possibilities. Whatever it decides to do, St. Louis needs to do something.\n\nPhoto by Michael B.

The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency has been developing it here for decades for defense purposes. Now, as it prepares to break ground on its $1.75 billion western campus just north of downtown, city government and business leaders are making a major push for the NGA to anchor a burgeoning industry.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s put the flag in the ground there.

In 2023 and 2025, that conference \u2014 along with its 4,000 attendees \u2014 will come to St. Louis.\n\nCity officials say it will be a major opportunity to sell businesses and talent on St. Louis.\n\nBy the numbers\n\nLoading...\n\nThe local economic impact of the geospatial industry is $4.9 billion, with nearly 11,000 people directly employed in the sector, according to figures recently calculated by the St. Louis Development Corporation.\n\n\u201cGeospatial has a strong root system here in St. Louis, with the NGA being the real anchor for us,\u201d said SLDC Director Otis Williams.\n\n\u201cBut there are a number of industry types and organizations that are already here. There are a significant number of jobs that are already here.\u201d\n\nThe NGA has about 3,000 workers at its current campus in south St. Louis. The federal agency also creates new jobs through contract work.\n\nEsri, which provides geospatial intelligence software and consulting to commercial agriculture companies and local governments, announced plans last month to double its workforce by the end of the year. That would bring its total workforce to 80 employees, split between its offices in St. Charles and in the Cortex district in Midtown. Another 40 jobs could be added next year.\n\nWhile Esri has a dedicated team that works with the NGA, this new hiring push is for the \u201ceverything-else market,\u201d said Matt Harman, head of the Esri Professional Services team in the Midwest.\n\nWhat\u2019s unique about the growth of the geospatial industry is that it intersects with nearly every business sector, according to AllianceSTL Senior Vice President Jim Alexander.\n\nHis newly formed economic development organization sees itself as the touchpoint for all new businesses looking to call St. Louis home. It\u2019s also focused heavily on recruiting those that may have never considered locating in Missouri, or the Midwest for that matter.\n\nIn order to tap into the high growth potential he sees for geospatial, Alexander says his group needs to start building coalitions with other industry sectors that are increasingly using the technology.\n\n\u201cThink of things like precision agriculture. So we need to bring those folks to the table. Utility companies, financial services, health care \u2014 all of these individual sectors are going to be relying more and more on geospatial to grow their businesses,\u201d Alexander said, adding that St. Louis is in a unique position to bring these kinds of industries together.\n\n\u201cI see the geospatial sector as holding really great promise for our region because we\u2019re the home of NGA West \u2014 no one else can make that claim.\u201d\n\nBuilding an ecosystem\n\nWhile the NGA may be the anchor, it can\u2019t build an industry alone. The federal spy agency is beginning to open up its blackbox to startups and researchers that can help push the envelope on innovation.\n\nBy the end of the year, T-Rex will debut what it\u2019s calling \u201cGeosaurus\u201d on its fourth floor. The Bayer-funded innovation space aims to bring together intelligence from the NGA, advanced IT startups and academic researchers and students studying the field, according to T-Rex Executive Director Patty Hagen.\n\nT-Rex\n\n\u201cSo you have data science, data management, agile development, open-source development, artificial intelligence, machine learning \u2014 every aspect of advanced IT is encapsulated or incorporated into geospatial industry and technologies.\u201d Hagen said. \u201cSo it\u2019s a great hook for a lot of the things we\u2019re doing here.\u201d\n\nShe sees potential not only for IT startups but businesses and city governments of all kinds.\n\n\u201cThere are incredible usages for location intelligence that can better inform both agriculture and conservation, efforts around climate change that will be important for all of our communities and for the world as we move forward,\u201d she said. \u201cAll of that kind of intelligence is highly needed now.\u201d\n\nThe geospatial industry is growing at a rapid clip. Globally, it\u2019s forecasted to become a more than $400 billion industry by 2020, according to the 2018 Geobuiz report.\n\nThat\u2019s what makes it an investment worth the time and energy of so many public and private officials, Hagen said. It\u2019s a long-term bet that the geospatial industry will spur not only technology advancements \u2014 but economic growth in the region, too.\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t really a great example of anything like this happening before in the nation, where there is a very advanced technology, and a federal agency lands a brand-new campus in what has been an underserved area in St Louis,\u201d she said. \u201cI think this is going to be studied for a long time to see what will happen to our community as this plays out over the next few years.\u201d\n\nGood Life Growing\u2019s Hillis will be watching closely as the industry blossoms in St. Louis. He said the push for geospatial innovation is a good thing, but he also has reservations about what role St. Louis residents will get to play.\n\n\u201cMaps can be tools for persuasion, and so it\u2019s very important that it is developed here within the area,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time, as it develops, how can it do so hand in hand with the local community that is there?\u201d\n\nFollow Corinne on Twitter: @corinnesusan\n\nSend questions and comments about this story to feedback@stlpublicradio.org", "title": "St. Louis Maps Effort To Become Magnet For Geospatial Industry", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['St. Louis']"}, {"id": 245, "city": "['Las Vegas']", "url": "https://www.archpaper.com/2019/09/bleutech-park-las-vegas-smart-city-controversy/", "text": "\u201cWe\u2019re working on a project that will blow your mind\u201d is the first thing one sees when visiting the website for Bleutech Park, a Las Vegas \u201cengineering firm\u201d with the tagline \u201cThe future of infrastructure.\u201d The firm is responsible for pitching what was anticipated to be the Las Vegas Valley\u2019s $7.5 billion smart city, revealed earlier in August.

It was expected to break ground this December and take six years to complete, despite the fact that many of the technologies promised in the proposal are still in their infancy (and commentators on AN\u2018s original article voiced similar suspicions).\n\nAs it turns out, the Miami Herald has been reporting on LeGrand\u2019s alleged transgressions since July 2017 when she first attempted to use an allegedly \u201cfake\u201d engineering firm, Bleu Network Inc., to score a $33.3 million construction contract with Homestead for a similar urban venture. She was then arrested, booked into Miami-Dade County Jail, and later filed a lawsuit against the city. In December 2017, she was charged again for wage theft, after allegedly failing to pay her employees hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nWhile the Miami-Dade charges are set for trial next month, that didn\u2019t stop LeGrand from posting bail, relocating, and attempting an even grander undertaking in Las Vegas. From the beginning, the advanced technology seemed to promise lofty sustainability goals. Such goals included creating tech that would make its \u201cown off-the-grid energy\u201d powered by the sun, wind, and even footsteps; \u201csupertrees\u201d that would support a 95-percent reduction in water consumption; as well as entire building facades functioning as solar panels.\n\nTom Letizia, a spokesperson for Bleutech, told Commercial Property Executive, \u201cWe hope to inspire other developers to commit to sustainability in a whole new way for our future and to put benefits ahead of costs.\u201d Over email correspondence, Letizia delivered a statement to AN from LeGrand: \u201cThe Miami Herald story was a total misrepresentation.

What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. Its reputation stays longer. Stag parties to high rollers, eloping lovebirds to drunken partygoers, it\u2019s the city that feels like an eternal festival, and one easily pigeonholed by anyone the slightest familiar with Sin City. Slots, poker and debauchery; bright lights to scorching sun; sleepless nights; and fat Elvis.\n\nIf cities were people, Las Vegas would be the archetypical rock and roll bad boy. The tabloids and the tears. It is brilliant and beguiling, inimitable and irresistible, but it is a city of one dimension. One reputation. Isn\u2019t it?\n\nIn 1972, Yale architecture tutors Denise Scott Brown and Robert Venturi\u2014alongside teaching assistant and co-author, Steven Izenour\u2014would shake the architectural world to its foundations with their groundbreaking publication, Learning From Las Vegas: the Forgotten Symbolism of Architectural Form. Boldly bumping heads with modernism, it would serve as a sort of blueprint for the no-holds-barred style of postmodernist design that has enjoyed a renaissance of late. Whisking 13 Yale students out to the Mojave Desert for a 12-week excursion, the progressive thinkers would document the wild and wonderful kitsch that was the Strip at the time.\n\nOften seen as the exact opposite of what studious architects would create, Vegas offered inspiration for a new generation tired of the constraints of modernist design. Much of what was documented in the book has since disappeared, but the essence they discovered endures. \u201cWhat will happen to the Strip when the tastemakers take over,\u201d they wrote. Nearly 50 years later, it\u2019s clear they needn\u2019t have worried. \u2018Miami Moroccan\u2019, \u2018Bauhaus Hawaiian\u2019 and \u2018Hollywood Orgasmic\u2019 were some of the \u2018styles\u2019 they noted on their trip, and Las Vegas is as off the wall today as ever. Could they have imagined a vast replica of Venice, complete with canals and gondolas? A 541-foot recreation of Paris\u2019s Eiffel Tower?\n\nWhilst Las Vegas might serve as a filterless vision of childlike architecture, a \u2018what if we let teenagers loose on urban planning\u2019 for poker players and partygoers, the arrival in 2009 of MGM\u2019s CityCenter hinted at a distinct shift in long-standing traditions of bad taste. A vast $10 billion complex of almost 17 million square feet, shy it is not, but it harnesses what has become known as \u2018the Bilbao effect\u2019; on account of Frank Gehry\u2019s monumental Guggenheim museum transforming the fortunes of the once-gritty Spanish city. Here in Nevada, the development called upon starchitects such as Daniel Libeskind and Norman Foster, its leisure and retail spaces bringing more to the city than more expansive nuos.\n\nAs well as big-hitting architecture, you\u2019ll also find public artworks from names like Jenny Holzer, Henry Moore, and Claes Oldenburg\u2014the Aria Fine Art Collection a treasure trove of contemporary art spread across an outdoor campus. Having all but dropped the CityCenter branding in favour of Aria, the development\u2019s centrepiece property, the concept remains the same. Connecting adjacent MGM properties Park MGM and the Bellagio by the Aria Express tram system, the project gives the Strip the \u2018centre\u2019 it was always missing, bringing a kind of order to the urban planning chaos that Scott Brown and Venturi found.\n\nOver at the hotel known by its dancing fountains, you\u2019ll find more culture in the shape of the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art, which is currently hosting Aftermath of Obliteration of Eternity, one of Yayoi Kusama\u2019s iconic Infinity Mirrored Rooms, alongside Narcissus Garden, an installation by the Japanese visionary that has been reinstalled in various settings since its conception more than 50 years ago.\n\nOn the other side of CityCenter, Park MGM offers another alternative vision of Sin City. A partnership between Sydell Group and MGM Resorts International, the resort\u2014formerly the Monte Carlo Resort and Casino\u2014is a social hub that brings the urbanity one might associate with New York or London to Vegas. The top floors deliver \u2018boutique\u2019 to the city, with the group\u2019s noted NoMad hotel arriving with subtle decadence. Informed by the grandeur of old-world European casinos, NoMad Casino is a refined space to play roulette, blackjack or poker underneath a Tiffany glass ceiling, craft cocktails heightening your confidence as the Rat Pack spirit returns and Vegas\u2019s glory days are recalled.\n\nChef Daniel Humm and restaurateur Will Guidara of New York\u2019s lauded three Michelin-starred Eleven Madison Park have created the restaurant and bar concept at NoMad; the Martin Brudnizki-designed Primrose takes its cues from 1950s South of France; and gourmet food truck pioneer Roy Choi brings mouthwatering casual dining to the resort in the shape of his Korean BBQ joint, Best Friend. It\u2019s not only about the style at Park MGM, there is plenty of substance to back it up.\n\nWith art and culture, fine dining and European flair, changing perceptions of Las Vegas around the infamous Strip, changes are abound in downtown too. A resident of the city, serial internet entrepreneur Tony Hsieh has ploughed huge amounts of money into developing the part of the city often left behind by the frenetic growth of the mega-resorts; most notably into The Las Vegas Arts District, an emerging neighbourhood gentrified in a bid to encourage artists to flock to the city, and the fabrication of businesses owned by locals as opposed to large corporations. Those looking for a side of culture for their weekend of gambling and debauchery today have more than the four miles of Strip to look past.\n\nThe Arts District, or the 18b (on account of it occupying 18 blocks of Downtown Las Vegas), is growing in popularity for its monthly block party and art walk, \u2018First Friday\u2019, which has seen food trucks and live music serving as a backdrop for artists showing their works off at a variety of open air and indoor galleries including The Arts Factory and ArtSquare; a hip establishment that\u2019s home to design stores, designers studios, wellness spots, and food and drink outlets. Debuting in 2013, Life Is Beautiful is a music and arts festival that transforms 18b, leaving a lasting legacy in the form of murals from the international street art elite.\n\nThe festival\u2019s ongoing collaboration with arts house Justkids this year saw creatives including Andr\u00e9 Saraiva, RETNA, and Egle Zvirblyte beautifying the 18 blocks\u2014with previous years hosting the likes of D*Face, Shepard Fairey, and Banksy. Acts such as Arcade Fire, Florence + The Machine, The xx, and Justice have kept the music flowing, whilst the culinary lineup sees more than 70 local and regional restaurants and bars, noted chefs and mixologists, food trucks and fine dining experiences. Comedians and talks from passionate internationally-renowned thought leaders complete the exhaustive Life Is Beautiful experience.\n\nWith its distinct bohemian vibe, downtown is also home to Freemont Street\u2014the \u2018original\u2019 Vegas, home to classic and pleasingly worn casinos like the handsome Golden Nugget. A far cry from the mammoth gaming experiences that surround the Strip, but its old-fashioned charm has seen it become a firm favourite with players, and it hosts one of the best poker tournaments in Vegas\u2014the gleefully garish bright-lights chaos of the Freemont Street Experience surrounding it, the Nugget and neighbouring casinos offer an unexpected slice of apple pie Americana.\n\nWith its kitsch neon, 1,500 ft canopy complete with \u2018Viva Vision\u2019 screen made up of 12.5 million LEDs, and slot-inspired zip line, there\u2019s much of the mania that ignited the fire inside the Yale architecture students here, but for the complete experience one must head a little less than a mile north, where one of the world\u2019s most unconventional museums awaits.\n\nWorth suffering the stifling desert heat for, the one-of-a-kind Neon Museum is dedicated to saving and preserving vintage neon signs, the 1996-founded partnership between the Allied Arts Council of Southern Nevada and the City of Las Vegas today an independent non-profit organisation located on Las Vegas Boulevard and Bonanza, exhibiting iconic signs restored to glory as the flux of the Strip has cast them aside. An unconventional museum in two parts, the defunct and decommissioned signs of Las Vegas now make their way to the Neon Boneyard\u2014looking more like a scrapyard for crapped-out motors minus the usual pair of mongrels on a chainlink leash keeping out the skiprats.\n\nTake a walk through a dilapidated but fascinating collection of signs dating back to the 1930s, marvel at the former lobby of the La Concha Motel, designed in the early 1960s by Paul William Revere, restored and transplanted to the museum as its unorthodox visitors centre. It\u2019s a reminder of the speed at which the cultural landscape shifts here; while high-rollers may be concerned with how not to bankrupt in Las Vegas casinos, here you can witness a rare fragility of the casinos themselves. Nothing is sacred in Sin City. As is the case with everything here, the Neon Museum delivers big for those curious of counterculture, and affirms that the city\u2019s reputation is one shifting with time.\n\nOverseen by a 40-foot-tall fire-breathing praying mantis\u2014originally built for the Burning Man festival and capable of shooting flames six storeys high\u2014the Downtown Container Park houses a selection off offbeat shops, restaurants, bars, and The Dome; an immersive 4K-visual entertainment experience that cocoons viewers with 14 million pixels in a series of ultra-HD, 360-degree imagery. Opening the same year Life Is Beautiful debuted, the open-air culture and retail centre is as close to intimate as you\u2019ll find in Las Vegas, and a project with community at its core. It is also a lasting example of the impact culture has had on this part of the city\u2014how Tony Hsieh\u2019s art-led vision for a downtown revival may manifest itself over time.\n\nWith grassroots art and culture shifting the landscape of Las Vegas\u2019s downtown, Park MGM reigniting the grandeur and glamour of old, and monumental architecture projects occupied by big-name contemporary art, changes are underfoot here in Sin City. Reviews of online casinos show that everything from security and trust to graphics and customer service are at an all-time high, it\u2019s natural that the world\u2019s most famous gambling capital needs shift its position.\n\nThe \u2018tastemakers\u2019 may not have taken over just yet, for it is still as bafflingly offbeat and idiosyncratic as ever, but the influence of hip neighbourhoods from London to Los Angeles has seeped in. Neon and kitsch remain in the \u2018entertainment capital of the world\u2019, poker and profligacy persist, but counterculture is guiding Las Vegas in a new and surprising direction. One dimensional?

Main St. in downtown Las Vegas. (Las Vegas Review-Journal)\n\nThe Las Vegas City Council on Monday approved a $616 million general fund spending plan for the coming fiscal year that accomplishes two key goals: It funds dozens of new public safety positions while staving off a structural deficit.\n\nThe final budget also keeps intact a $5 million surplus projected during a review of the tentative plan in April.\n\nIt will be used to fully fund a third wave of hiring for city marshals, staff 13 positions at Fire Station 103, hire eight administrators in the Department of Public Safety and provide the city\u2019s share of 62 new Metropolitan Police Department employees, including 40 police officers.\n\nMetro\u2019s request for staffing, which the city shares with Clark County, fell by $2.7 million since last month, enabling the city to contribute more money to capital improvement projects, according to Chief Financial Officer Gary Ameling.\n\nDespite attention to public safety, the spending plan does not fund initiatives for homelessness, the council\u2019s other high-priority issue, leaving officials to continue searching for money elsewhere.\n\nAmeling estimated the city would spend $35 million on homelessness for fiscal year 2020, excluding capital funds, but less than 10 percent of it is expected to be directed toward outreach. Much of the cost is associated with law enforcement, fire services and the court system, according to Monday\u2019s presentation to the council.\n\nCouncilman Bob Coffin pointed to the failure this legislative session of a city-sponsored bill to generate new funding for fighting homelessness through a sewer surcharge and real estate transfer taxes. The bill was later amended to create a working group to address homelessness instead.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t listen to us in Carson City,\u201d Coffin said. \u201cThey gave us the cold shoulder.\u201d\n\nWhile the city\u2019s final budget also showed healthy $20 million-plus reserves, it also revealed that more work needs to be done to beat back the likelihood of sinking into deficit spending by as early as fiscal year 2022.\n\nCity expenses are growing at 4.1 percent, outpacing the 3.5 percent revenue growth, meaning that the practice of freezing non-critical jobs to save money is expected to continue. Las Vegas has left 82 positions unfilled to save $8 million thus far, but the goal is to save $10 million, Ameling said.\n\nAdding to the caution, the city\u2019s reliance on property tax and consolidated tax revenues, including sales tax, is particularly precarious in the event of a likely economic slowdown because both sources are sensitive to fluctuations.\n\nStill, both tax streams continue to fare well, projected to rise by 5.8 and 5 percent, respectively, in the coming fiscal year.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very exciting time,\u201d Ameling said of the city\u2019s booming economic development. \u201cBut we\u2019re keeping an eye on it because we\u2019re not quite sure how it\u2019s going to play out.\u201d\n\nContact Shea Johnson at sjohnson@reviewjournal.com or 702-383-0272.

Today, there are about 500 miles citywide and an additional 200 miles in other parts of the Valley.\n\nCar culture, funding restrictions on cycling infrastructure and the sprawling nature of the Valley have historically created challenges for urban cycling. But as Southern Nevada grows in population and road biking becomes more normalized, the region\u2019s cities and Clark County are adopting more bike-friendly policies and infrastructure, albeit incrementally.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building it little by little,\u201d said Marco Velotta, a senior management analyst in the City of Las Vegas\u2019 Planning Department.\n\nThe efforts seem to be bringing more cyclists out of the shadows. The number of people carrying bicycles onto Regional Transportation Commission buses has been steadily increasing in the past several years, RTC data shows. In May, the agency counted about 56,000 bicycles on buses, and officials continue to observe \u201cwell-utilized\u201d bike racks around the Las Vegas Strip, said Ron Floth, bicycle and community outreach coordinator for the RTC.\n\nCyclists range from children biking to school (particularly in more residential, higher-income neighborhoods) to millennials to aging baby boomers, Floth said. Some cycle primarily to commute, others for leisure and exercise, and others because bicycles are their primary or most reliable form of transportation.\n\n\u201cPeople [are] riding from transit to their final destination, which is work. We\u2019re seeing quite a bit of that,\u201d Floth said.\n\nWithin the city limits, affluent Summerlin seems to have the largest biking population and the most bike lanes, some of which were created by the Howard Hughes Corporation that owns and manages the master-planned community, according to Velotta. Also-affluent Henderson is similarly known for its high concentration of bike lanes and bike paths.\n\nA major goal in the region now is to make biking as equitable as possible, in part by expanding bike infrastructure into all neighborhoods and communities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to make sure an area like Summerlin has facilities, and that\u2019s important, but we want to make sure we hit places like Downtown and Wards 1, 3 and 5 in the center of the city,\u201d Velotta said.\n\nChanging the culture\n\nDespite a growth in bike infrastructure and bike riders, cyclists and planners acknowledge that the region has a long way to go to protect cyclists and instill a share-the-road mentality throughout the Valley, especially among drivers.\n\n\u201cWe still need to do more on the encouragement part and the enforcement part,\u201d Velotta said.\n\nCyclist injuries and fatalities at the hands of drivers remain common; four cyclists have been killed so far this year in Clark County, according to the Nevada Office of Traffic Safety.\n\nTo reduce fatalities and collisions, many cyclists would like to see stronger enforcement of a Nevada law requiring drivers to maintain a three-foot distance from cyclists when passing them on the road. Although the three-foot law has been in place for years, drivers who hit cyclists (and therefore have automatically broken the law) still often get off scot-free, said Heather Fisher, president of the Summerlin-based bike shop Las Vegas Cyclery.\n\nMany drivers don\u2019t even know that the law exists, and lax enforcement doesn\u2019t help, Fisher added.\n\n\u201cIt just needs to be promoted through the DMV, through signage, or anywhere we can get the word out,\u201d she said.\n\nFisher has lived and biked in the Valley since 1992 and now lives in Blue Diamond, a more rural and potentially safer enclave for cyclists compared with heavily trafficked areas such as Downtown Las Vegas.\n\nDowntown, for its part, has some of the strongest cycling infrastructure in the area, including highlighted green bike lanes and access to the RTC\u2019s bike center and bike share program. But cyclists often agree that it is still one of the most hostile areas, mostly because of the amount of vehicular traffic it gets.\n\n\u201cWhen you get into some of the more high-traffic areas closer to Downtown, people seem to be less [bike]-friendly. People are in a hurry, and maybe they don\u2019t expect [cyclists] there,\u201d said biker and North Las Vegas resident Mary Margaret Williams.\n\nIt\u2019s a problem no longer unique to Downtown, as population and traffic continue to rise rapidly. Even though there are more cyclists on the road than there were 10 years ago, there are also more drivers, many of whom are more distracted than ever before, said biker Sean Tyrone.\n\n\u201cThere are \u2026 more close calls, more accidents and more deaths, and 99% of them are because of driver inattention,\u201d said Tyrone, who is also chief operating officer of Las Vegas Cyclery.\n\nTyrone used to commute for years from east Las Vegas to Green Valley. That bike route is a lot more problematic today, he said.\n\n\u201cI had a lot of close calls [before], but nothing like what I\u2019ve seen and experienced personally in the last five years,\u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that growth cannot be accomplished in a way that helps cyclists, Fisher noted. For example, the Southern Nevada Regional Bicycle Coalition is pushing for developers to start including bike lanes whenever they build new housing. The City of Las Vegas\u2019 2050 Master Plan will also include a greater emphasis on multimodal transit, including cycling.\n\nFunding for cycling infrastructure has always been a challenge when it comes to getting more bike lanes onto the streets. The Las Vegas Planning Department\u2019s budget for bicycle infrastructure is still a tiny fraction of the rest of the budget, but it is becoming more of a priority, Velotta said. Other departments\u2014such as Public Works, Parks and Recreation, and Operations and Maintenance\u2014are also beginning to embrace cycling-friendly policies, he said.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we\u2019re including more and more buffer lanes, and that is now kind of the default, it just shows that there\u2019s more of a commitment there to making complete streets possible,\u201d Velotta said.\n\nPouring money into the issue isn\u2019t a guarantee the region will become more bike-friendly, but if the money goes toward installing cycling infrastructure and signs, it can at least help drivers prepare to see cyclists and understand how to interact with them, Williams said. She acknowledged that cyclists must understand how to interact with drivers safely as well, something the RTC has been promoting through bike safety programs and educational workshops.\n\nAs a cyclist, the key to safety is to stay with traffic, utilize hand signals and use a bike light at night, which is required under Nevada law, Floth said. Although biking on sidewalks is permitted in most of Clark County with the exception of North Las Vegas, cyclists are safer when they act like motor vehicles and go with the flow, Floth emphasized.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we talk to cyclists about all the time is to ride predictably,\u201d he added. \u201cThat way, motorists know what they\u2019re going to do.\u201d\n\nIn the coming years, Fisher hopes that the region will recognize not only the health, environmental and recreational benefits of cycling, but also how becoming a cycling city could propel Las Vegas into the future.\n\n\u201cYou go to other cities and there\u2019s bike lanes everywhere and bike paths everywhere,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cThey do that to attract the newer, younger tech-y job market to their cities, and to diversify. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to have to do here.\u201d\n\nPlanners seem to have a similar vision.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come considerably far over the past decade,\u201d Velotta said. \u201cWe really have seen a physical transformation as a result. But we still have a lot of work to do.\u201d\n\nThis story originally appeared in the Las Vegas Weekly.", "title": "Las Vegas cyclists feel growth \u2014 and growing pains \u2014 as region becomes more bike friendly", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Las Vegas']"}, {"id": 250, "city": "['Portland']", "url": "https://www.oregonlive.com/news/2019/08/northwest-portland-homeless-navigation-center-opens-in-lauded-public-private-partnership.html", "text": "A homeless shelter funded in part by private sector donations opened Monday as part of a summer push to remake Portland\u2019s shelter system.\n\nThe Harbor of Hope River District Navigation Center was the brainchild of developer Homer Williams. He raised about $3 million from Columbia Sportswear CEO Tim Boyle and other private donations to cover the $3.5 million construction costs for the giant tent-like structure.\n\n\u201cWe have in our city a humanitarian crisis,\u201d Williams said at the unveiling. \u201cToday, this is a step on a very, very long journey.\u201d\n\nThe shelter can serve up to 100 people at a time and will be open all hours, all days. Nonprofit Transition Projects will operate the shelter. People interested in staying there must make reservations through Transition Projects.\n\nSeveral officials praised the shelter as an example of a successful public-private partnership, with Mayor Ted Wheeler calling it \u201cone of the most ambitious\u201d to date to combat the growing homeless population.\n\nHowever, it wasn\u2019t originally envisioned to be a partnership.\n\nWilliams, and his nonprofit Harbor of Hope, initially promised that the shelter and its services would be entirely paid by the private sector.\n\nHarbor of Hope broke ground last April on land donated by Portland\u2019s urban renewal agency, which will retain ownership of the land. The city waived permit fees.\n\nBy the time Williams raised the $3.5 million estimated to complete the project, the cost had doubled.\n\nThe Joint Office of Homeless Services, which is funded by both the city and county, agreed to contribute the first year\u2019s operating budget, which will pay for staff, programming and day-to-day needs at the shelter. Officials estimate that to cost at least $1 million.\n\nThe \u201cnavigation center\u201d model is an adaptation of what San Francisco and other cities have done. It combines traditional shelter space with intensive help from service providers to help the people who stay at the shelter get into permanent housing as quickly as possible. It also has laundry facilities, showers and other amenities.\n\nBy the time it opened Monday, the idea is less novel than when proposed. This summer, the Joint Office unveiled the Laurelwood Center, which will house up to 120 women and couples, as well as provide on-site social services.\n\nOfficials noted Monday that the new openings and restructuring of the shelter system is intended to bring more spaces in line with that model.\n\nEarlier this summer, Lilac Meadows, a 40-room family shelter on Southeast Powell Boulevard, opened in a former motel.

(AP) \u2014 Portland police are mobilizing to prevent clashes between out-of-state far-right groups planning a rally here and the homegrown anti-fascists who oppose them as America's culture wars seep into this progressive haven.\n\nSaturday's rally \u2014 and the violence it may bring \u2014 are a relatively new reality here, as an informal coalition of white nationalists, white supremacists and extreme-right militias hones its focus on Oregon's largest city as a stand-in for everything it feels is wrong with the U.S. At the top of that list are the masked and black-clad anti-fascists who turn out to violently oppose right-wing demonstrators as soon as they set foot in town.\n\n\"It's Portlandia, and in the public mind it represents everything these (far-right) groups are against,\" said Heidi Beirich, director of the Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups. \"It's progressive, and even more offensive to them, it's progressive white people who should be on these guys' side.\"\n\nThe groups know they will get a headline-grabbing reaction from Portland's so-called \"antifa,\" whose members have issued an online call to their followers to turn out to \"defend Portland from a far-Right attack.\" Portland's Rose City Antifa, the nation's oldest active anti-fascist group, says violence against right-wing demonstrators is \"exactly what should happen when the far-right attempts to invade our town.\"\n\nPortland leaders are planning a major law enforcement presence on the heels of similar rallies in June and last summer that turned violent, and the recent hate-driven shooting in El Paso, Texas. None of the city's nearly 1,000 police officers will have the day off, and Portland will get help from the Oregon State Police and the FBI. Mayor Ted Wheeler has said he may ask Gov. Kate Brown, a Democrat, to call up the Oregon National Guard.\n\n\"There's no winning for the cops in a situation like this. There just isn't,\" Beirich said. \"This is hard-core stuff, and I don't think you can be too cautious.\"\n\nExperts who track right-wing militias and hate groups warn that the mix of people heading to Portland also came together for a Unite the Right rally in 2017 in Charlottesville, Virginia, which ended when a participant rammed his car into a crowd of counterprotesters, killing one person and injuring 19.\n\nThe rally is being organized by a member of the Proud Boys, who have been designated by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a hate group. Others expected include members of the American Guard, the Three Percenters, the Oathkeepers and the Daily Stormers. American Guard is a white nationalist group, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, while the Three Percenters and the Oathkeepers are extremist anti-government militias. The Daily Stormers are neo-Nazis, according to the center.\n\nPortland's fraught history with hate groups adds to the complex dynamic.\n\nMany of today's anti-fascists trace their activist heritage to a group that battled with neo-Nazis in Portland's streets decades ago, and they feel this is the same struggle in a new era, said Randy Blazak, the leading expert on the history of hate groups in Oregon.\n\nWhite supremacists murdered an Ethiopian man, Mulugeta Seraw, in Portland in 1988. And by the 1990s, Portland was known as Skinhead City because it was the home base of Volksfront, at the time one of the most active neo-Nazi groups in the U.S. As recently as 2007, neo-Nazis attempted to gather in Portland for a three-day skinhead festival.\n\n\"When I'm looking at what's happening right now, for me it's a direct line back to the 1980s: the battles between the racist skinheads and the anti-racist skinheads,\" Blazak said. \"It's the latest version of this thing that's been going on for 30 years in this city.\"\n\nPolice, meanwhile, have seemed overwhelmed by the cultural forces at war in their streets.\n\nAt the June rally, masked antifa members beat up a conservative blogger named Andy Ngo. Video of the 30-second attack grabbed national attention and further turned the focus on Portland as a new battleground in a divisive America.\n\nRepublican Sens. Ted Cruz, of Texas, and Bill Cassidy, of Louisiana, introduced a congressional resolution calling for anti-fascists to be declared domestic terrorists, and President Donald Trump echoed that theme in a tweet last month. Portland's City Hall has been evacuated twice due to bomb threats after the June 29 skirmishes, and Wheeler, the mayor, has been pilloried by critics who incorrectly said he told police to stand down while anti-fascists went after right-wing demonstrators.\n\n\"I don't want for one minute anyone to think that because we're being thrust into this political show, that I or the public have lost confidence in (police officers') ability to do what we do,\" said Police Chief Danielle Outlaw, who is regularly heckled as she leaves City Hall by those who feel the police target counterprotesters for arrest over far-right demonstrators.\n\nPolice have noted the violence in June was limited to a small area of downtown Portland despite three different demonstrations that lasted more than five hours, with hundreds of people constantly on the move. They also made two arrests last week in a May Day assault on an antifa member that became a rallying cry for the city's far-left.\n\n\"We'll be ready for the 17th here in little Portland, Oregon,\" Wheeler, the mayor, told The Associated Press. \"But at the end of the day, the bigger question is about our nation's moral compass and which direction it's pointing.\"\n\nBlazak, the Oregon hate groups expert, said he worries the extreme response from a small group of counterprotesters is starting to backfire. Many in the city oppose the right-wing rallies but also dislike the violent response of antifa, which provides social media fodder for the far-right.\n\n\"The opposition is playing right into the alt-right's hands by engaging with them this way,\" he said.\n\nJoe Biggs, organizer of Saturday's rally, said the attack on Ngo made him decide to hold the event with the goal of getting antifa declared a domestic terrorist organization. Biggs said those coming to Portland have been told not to bring weapons or start fights, but they will defend themselves if attacked.\n\nBiggs toned down his online rhetoric after the El Paso shootings and urged followers coming to Portland to keep a cool head. He says he is not racist \u2014 he has a toddler daughter with his Guyanese wife \u2014 but wants to show the world antifa's violent tactics.\n\n\"That group of antifa there in Portland needs to be exposed for who they are,\" Biggs said in a phone interview with The Associated Press. \"And guess what? They should be scared.\"\n\nEveryday Portlanders, however, are feeling more frustrated than scared by the protests that bring their city to a standstill. A 5K race scheduled for Saturday along the waterfront was moved at the last minute to avoid any violence, and an Irish bar that's a city institution canceled an amateur boxing event that draws 500 spectators. Other businesses plan to close on one of the last weekends of the city's peak tourist season.\n\n\"People are nervous, people are hesitant to go anywhere near that area, and I don't blame them,\" said Aaron Montaglione, owner of Terrapin Events, which is putting on the 5K race. \"It's affecting everyone.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Gillian Flaccus on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/gflaccus\n\n___\n\nThis version corrects the spelling of Mulugeta Seraw's last name.", "title": "Risk of Clashes at Rally Mobilizes Portland, Oregon, Police", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "['protest', 'police']", "annot_city": "['Portland']"}, {"id": 252, "city": "['Portland']", "url": "https://pamplinmedia.com/pt/9-news/433358-342481-mayor-most-protests-arent-violent-city-isnt-lawless", "text": "Mayor: Most protests aren't violent, city isn't 'lawless'\n\nPortland Mayor Ted Wheeler addresses misperceptions about Portland during news conference.\n\nPortland played host to more than 200 protests and political demonstrations last year, but only a small fraction turned violent.\n\nThat's according to Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler, speaking during a 30-minute press conference on Monday, July 8. They were his first public remarks since a slew of three local rallies devolved into ugly street fighting on June 29, grabbing international attention.\n\nNoting the \"global shellacking\" and deluge of death threats sent to his office, the mayor pushed back against what he deemed a misinformation campaign circulating about the Rose City.\n\n\"I want to address the perception that Portland is somehow a lawless city,\" Wheeler said. \"People who live here, people who know Portland, know that is simply not true.\"\n\nHe then laid some of the blame on the president of the Portland Police Association, Daryl Turner, who sent out a July 1 news release calling on Wheeler to \"remove the handcuffs from our officers.\" The claim was widely repeated online, and was sometimes attributed directly to the Portland Police Bureau, rather than the rank-and-file union Turner represents.\n\n\"He crossed a line,\" Wheeler said of Turner.\n\nSaying he wants lots of options on the table, Wheeler declined to explicitly endorse the proposal floated on July 3 by Police Chief Danielle Outlaw, who called for a law making it illegal to wear a mask while committing crimes. Outlaw also suggested changes to a law that prevents authorities from filming a political rally unless a crime is occurring.\n\nInstead, Wheeler announced plans to seek input from business leaders, civil rights advocates and the community at large as he mulls new strategies to address protest violence, which he said was less prevalent now than when he took office two-and-a-half years ago.\n\n\"I don't believe Chief Outlaw and I are in a position to singularly or independently resolve this question without the community,\" Wheeler said.\n\nThe Portland Police Bureau is preparing an after-action report regarding the June 29 demonstration that should be completed within 10 days. Wheeler said he held a \"brainstorming\" session with Billy J. Williams, the U.S. attorney for the District of Oregon, as well.\n\nThe mayor and his advisers may not have much time to implement new ideas, whatever they may be. The right-wing Proud Boys already have set the date for their next demonstration here on Saturday, Aug. 17 \u2014 an event sure to draw a swarm of counter-protesters.\n\nBut here's one idea that won't be revisited: Wheeler's protest safety ordinance, which was voted down by the City Council 3-2 last year. Wheeler says the votes haven't changed.\n\nCommissioner Chloe Eudaly, one of the no votes, sat silently in the audience during much of the press conference.\n\nYou count on us to stay informed and we depend on you to fund our efforts.

The 35-story tower project, which will also include offices and condominiums, is testament to the rapid growth the city has experienced in recent years. It also embodies the cultural shift sweeping through this once blue-collar town. A street- level food hall will be built where some 40 food carts stood only weeks earlier.\n\nWhen the property manager, City Center Parking, announced that it was evicting the food carts in Portland\u2019s largest, oldest, and most iconic street food epicenter, giving owners just 30 days to move out, city officials scrambled to find the businesses a new home. Cart owners and their employees \u2014 said to be at least 200 people strong \u2014 organized and community leaders rallied around them. After weeks of proposed temporary solutions, the city has finally found space for the carts and the businesses will be back up and running soon.\n\nBut this happy ending follows a very tense and trying few months that should serve as a cautionary tale for any city undergoing an influx of new residents and business investments, where lower-income, immigrant, and other vulnerable populations are displaced by successive waves of people attracted to the very culture those populations helped create.\n\n\u201cThese food carts sprung up in a bad economy so that the lot owners could get an additional revenue stream,\u201d said Keith M. Jones of Friends of the Green Loop, a public space advocate who worked closely with cart owners and city officials through the eviction and relocation process. \u201cNow land is at a premium, so these lots are going to start disappearing and getting developed. The future of food carts in Portland is grim.\u201d\n\nPortland has decided that food carts \u2014 which, unlike food trucks, are immobile unless towed \u2014 are an indelible part of the city\u2019s culture, but the saga of relocating more than three dozen businesses on short notice, and working with a largely immigrant community who speak many languages, suggests that cities would benefit from planning ahead to decide which cherished institutions will be ushered through change, and how that will happen.\n\n\u201c[The city] is trying to save the food carts,\u201d says cart owner Richard Tran. \u201cThe tourists come here and they look for the food carts.\u201d\n\nA brief history of the pod\n\nThe Alder Street food cart pod began when a few culinary upstarts began renting space along the edges of a downtown parking lot in the 1990s. Over the years, their numbers grew, encircling parked cars and enticing passing office workers with the smells of curries, tacos, kebabs, stir-fry, and pizza. The model spread to other downtown lots, then beyond the urban core, and eventually to other cities.\n\nIn a state where roughly 10 percent of all residents are foreign-born, and over 12 percent have at least one immigrant parent, food carts play an important role in helping new citizens forge autonomous futures. \u201cFood carts have become a part of the DNA of Portland, not to mention our tourism industry and local economy,\u201d said city Commissioner Chloe Eudaly in a statement on the Gofundme page Jones set up to help fund the transition. \u201cMany of the Alder Street carts are owned by immigrants and people of color, and as we continue to face an affordability crisis, we have to start addressing the displacement of small businesses as well as residents.\u201d\n\nPortland has become a popular tourist destination in no small part because of its food cart pods \u2014 functionally permanent installations of individual eateries that are more affordable to open and operate than a standard brick-and-mortar restaurant. But that popularity also drove up real estate prices.\n\nA shuffling of priorities\n\nIn October 2018, developers cleared a smaller food cart pod directly across from Alder Street to make way for a Marriott Moxy hotel, inspiring a coalition of foodies and urban design activists to propose a development-proof plan for housing carts on city streets. Talk of a \u201c culinary corridor\u201d faded quickly from the news, but it has this year resurfaced with a vengeance.\n\nPaperwork for the Ritz-Carlton development was filed in 2018, and some cart owners began moving to other pods when they heard. Others sold their carts in situ to aspiring chefs who were either unaware of the hotel, or brazen enough, to risk investing in prime street food real estate in hopes of establishing themselves in the time that remained.\n\nLei (who goes by one name) is a good example. He left the military and spent $20,000 to open Eggy Pocket in September 2018, a month after his parents came to the U.S. on short notice. \u201cThey worked for restaurants in China,\u201d he said. \u201cAfter they came here, they don\u2019t speak English, so the food truck is small investment and we can make some money \u2014 slowly. But it works pretty good.\u201d\n\nFood carts run on tight margins, however, making it difficult for most owners to save up for unexpected expenses or gaps in income. In the last days before eviction, while his parents served customers their popular cr\u00eape-like bings, Lei worried over their future, as well as his wife and one-year-old. Eggy Pocket supported everyone.\n\nThe family plans to spend the next few months looking for a new spot downtown. \u201cIf nothing comes up then we\u2019ll take the next step, probably find a job or sell the food truck,\u201d he said.\n\nAlthough intentions for the tower construction were public, the project\u2019s timeline remained vague until recently. Several cart owners and those helping with their relocation have accused the lot\u2019s management company, City Center Parking, of keeping the information from them in order to continue collecting rent for as long as possible, but the company did not respond to requests for comment from Civil Eats.\n\nThere are 37 other food cart pods listed throughout Portland, but with more than 500 carts operating at any given time space has become rarified and rents are climbing\u2014particularly downtown.\n\nSarhan, who also goes by one name, has located his business, Noah Halal, on a corner of Alder Street for the past six years. He found a new location for his cart four blocks away in a nearby pod, although he is worried about how the new spot would impact his late-night business. \u201cI have two uncles that own food trucks [in Portland]; they\u2019ve been there longer than we have, so we know a lot of people,\u201d he said.\n\nThe cart owners who hadn\u2019t secured a future home careened toward the end of June without a plan to haul their carts off the property or anywhere to take them.\n\nChef Sam Mouzon has been running carts at Alder Street for the past several years, and opened a barbecue cart two years ago. He accepted an invitation to move his cart across town, behind a martial arts studio where another cart is current parked. The change suits his eventual desire to open a brick-and-mortar restaurant, but he worries about his neighbors, especially those who are new to the U.S.\n\nFor established citizens like Mouzon, securing loans, dealing with tow-truck companies, and signing new leases isn\u2019t likely to be as difficult as it is for many of his neighbors. \u201cIt\u2019s not exactly easy for several of the food cart owners here,\u201d he said. \u201cFor a lot of them, it was a challenge just to get into [the Alder Steer pod].\u201d\n\nA temporary site is proposed\n\nKeith Jones and the Portland Bureau of Transportation officials began meeting regularly with owners at Alder Street in the wake of the eviction notice. On June 24, exactly one week before the lot was vacated, the city announced a proposal to relocate 37 carts to a nearby city park through the end of the tourist season.\n\nBut this temporary site would not be ready in a week\u2019s time. Money was needed. Permits were needed. Water and electrical hookups would need to be installed. The neighbors would have to agree.\n\nUnlike food truck owners, food cart owners cannot simply drive their businesses off the lot and park in a driveway until a new pod opens. Thirty-some carts in various states of disrepair would need to be relocated multiple times. All of it would cost money, and at a time when cart owners were facing a gap in revenue.\n\nBoping Wong, originally from Guangzhou, China, opened Asian Fusion Bowl in 2017 after years of working in Portland restaurants. When she spoke with Civil Eats in late June, she had heard about the temporary site idea, but had no confirmation that she would be allowed to park there and no plan to move her cart. Wong thought that it would be in the city\u2019s best interest to help owners relocate to keep everyone off the unemployment rolls and food stamps.\n\n\u201cWe live month to month, paycheck to paycheck,\u201d said Mouzon. \u201cNo one\u2019s getting rich out here. You can make a living, but the labor costs are going up. [Our customers don\u2019t] want to pay more; everybody likes carts because it\u2019s cheap food.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s never a good time for a small business owner to have to close shop, but for the food carts in a city with long, rainy winters, summer offers an opportunity to make up the difference.\n\n\u201cThese are the most important months for us. July is double the income of October, \u201d said Khalid Saad, who emigrated from Baghdad in 2008 and opened his first cart soon after. In its current location, Baghdad Iraqi Grill has been serving downtown workers and visitors mesquite chicken shawarma for four years. Alder Street\u2019s legendary status and proximity to Portland\u2019s hotels brings in a booming tourist trade over the summer.\n\nSaad said he liked the location of the proposed nearby temporary site because his regular customers would still be able to find him. \u201cI\u2019ve been in downtown for nine years, I don\u2019t want to move out,\u201d he said.\n\nThe clock winds down\n\nAnxious but hopeful, owners and their employees kept serving customers. But as time passed without any official word, rumors filled the void, as did a polyglot game of telephone. Many people held onto faith that the city would come through with a solution\u2014some had heard that the city was paying to tow everyone to new locations.\n\n\u201cSo far, I don\u2019t have any information,\u201d said Ling Chen, who began serving up her family-recipe sheng jian bao in the spring of 2018, after years as a stay-at-home mom. \u201cI\u2019m just waiting.\u201d But she held on to optimism because, as she put it, \u201ceveryone knows Portland for food carts.\u201d\n\nOthers grew cynical and worried that when summer faded, cart owners would be abandoned to their own fates. Property owners from the outskirts of town dropped off flyers offering to buy the carts or rent spaces in the culinary hinterlands. City Center Parking employees handed out warnings that any cart left on the lot come July 1 would be towed at the owner\u2019s expense.\n\nRichard Tran was considering to packing it in and selling the truck. He had started Rolls Plus Grill eight years ago, paying $14,000 for a seven-year-old cart after being laid off from Nike. \u201cI like to cook,\u201d he says. \u201cI cooked when I was in Vietnam when I was 16 years old. I cooked for my family, my cousin\u2019s family.\u201d\n\nOn June 28, three days before the eviction, Prosper Portland, the city\u2019s development agency, announced that it had donated the parking lot of a derelict post office to store carts for at least six months. Keith Jones launched a Gofundme campaign to pay for towing. Jones also arranged Mandarin, Thai, Arabic, and Spanish translators to speak with cart owners at a meeting the night before to curtail any further confusion.\n\nTow trucks arrived to begin clearing the tightly packed parking lot the next day, and a game of reverse Tetris ensued. Many carts had been at Alder Street for years, neglected by successive owners. Tires were flat and axles were busted. The towering Boom Cr\u00eapes slipped off its cinderblock foundation while being jacked up for new wheels, rattling the two employees still inside serving customers.\n\nThere was relief, but also sadness. A man dismantling the awning of Aybla Grill said that he\u2019d been there for 16 years. Young Kim of 1 Bento Korean BBQ had spent the past 13 years selling kalbi short ribs done in his grandmother\u2019s style alongside his wife and one longtime employee. By Sunday night, the last day before eviction, carts had been towed by two companies at a cost of $7,500.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s great that we have a safe place to store our cart,\u201d Lily Chen, a full-time student whose father Qing worked at their Hua Li House, wrote in an email. \u201cBefore, we were not sure how we were going to tow it, and where to store it. Our last resort was towing it home to our driveway. It\u2019s generous of Prosper Portland to help us with this!\u201d\n\nCart owners like Chen were uncertain how long they could wait before finding another way to make a living. \u201cMy dad has been cooking for a long time, and he loves it. He loves being able to interact with our customers, even though there may be a communication barrier,\u201d she writes. \u201cHe also does it because both my sister and I are in school, and tuition is costly.\u201d\n\nJones says he\u2019s hoping to put together a group of volunteers to help repair the carts. \u201cSo when they do move they\u2019ve got a fresh coat of paint and they\u2019re ready to get started from scratch.\u201d\n\nWhile the carts have idled outside the vacant post office, Jones, Qing Chen, and others began addressing a long-ignored problem. Alder Street had become a pod organically, without the modern infrastructure that later pods had built in. Many vendors had been allowed to operate in open violation of many city codes, from unlicensed awnings hanging over sidewalks to wastewater running along the ground to open storm drains. When the carts opened again they would have to be street legal from all four sides.\n\nBut it still remained to be seen when the carts would reopen. The temporary site around two blocks of city park fell through on July 10, which Jones said city officials attributed to neighbors. Jones was concerned that too much infrastructure would be required for a short-term location. Two carts left storage within the first week of July to re-open in other existing pods, and as a last resort, Jones was prepared to begin placing carts individually or in small groups on whatever property he could find.\n\nA solution appears\n\nLast week, the city announced that a new pod would be constructed at Ankeny Square, a disused public park three blocks from Alder Street. Individual carts will sit on city streets, with potential seating in the square. The new location came about through the collaboration of the Portland Bureau of Transportation, the Bureau of Parks and Recreation, and the Friends of the Green Loop. The latter group secured permits from both bureaus and will serve as a landlord to the cart owners. The Gofundme campaign Jones started is collecting funds to pay for infrastructure, and the business association Travel Portland contributed a lump sum of $25,000 to get things started.\n\nBut this solution won\u2019t solve the city\u2019s larger problems. As Portland\u2019s population swells, many more of the parking lots these carts began populating in hodgepodge fashion decades ago will most likely be developed. Lot after lot will eventually close and those carts will need new homes. The other pods around the city can\u2019t absorb them all. And some of those have already become imperiled by land sales.\n\nBut the forthcoming Ankeny Square pod may be the first phase of the long-discussed \u201cCulinary Corridor.\u201d Keith Jones originally began working with food cart owners when early plans for the corridor included stretches of Portland\u2019s proposed Green Loop, a six-mile, car-free urban trail plotted along both sides of the Willamette River, which separates downtown from most of the residential neighborhoods.\n\nTime will tell how quickly the Ankeny Square pod will be up and running. Many of the remaining carts may have to move elsewhere just to make a living while the details get worked out.\n\nAt the heart of the change are big questions about the city\u2019s priorities. How important are small businesses to Portland\u2019s leaders? Are low-barrier opportunities for new immigrants a priority? Is Portland, a city that has long trafficked in its own quirkiness, becoming too slick to make space for the kinds of operations that put it on the map? What will remain?\n\n\u201cI got involved with Culinary Corridor and that\u2019s my angle here,\u201d said Jones. \u201cBut then I realized that there are so many players involved in this, on the private side and the public side. No one was talking to each other. I thought, \u2018These are people\u2019s lives and businesses, so we\u2019ve got to get organized.\u2019\u201d\n\nCorrection: The subhead has been corrected to reflect that the city of Portland did not shut down the Alder pod; developers did.\n\n\u2022 Will Portland\u2019s Development Boom Leave Room for Its Food Carts?

In exchange, Portland gets access to a massive dataset that mirrors how people actually move throughout the city and its surroundings.\n\nThe purpose is to regularly query, for example, timely insights into what worker commutes entail, what the impacts of Uber and Lyft are on traffic congestion, and how many cyclists use protected bike lanes such as those along high-trafficked areas like Governor Tom McCall Waterfront Park.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be looking to Replica to explore a number of questions about major issues in our region like equity, safety, and congestion,\u201d said Eliot Rose, technology strategist at Portland\u2019s Metro, one of the three agencies chipping in to pay for the $457,000 project also funded by TriMet and Portland\u2019s Bureau of Transportation.\n\nOne might expect such an effort to entail surveillance cameras, sensors, or other physical tracking devices, but that\u2019s not what this is about.

Both Sidewalk Labs and Portland Metro confirmed that no sensors, beacons, cameras, IoT devices or WiFi hotspots or WiFi kiosks will be used or installed as part of the firm\u2019s partnership in Portland.\n\nStill, there are questions about the specific origins of the data used in Replica.\n\n\u201cIf a city is going to use a system, it has a responsibility to have full transparency about where all of the data is coming from, how it is being deidentified and to what level, and if that data is reused again or stored by Replica or Sidewalk or passed to its parent company,\u201d said Pam Dixon, executive director of Oregon-based nonprofit World Privacy Forum. \u201cThere\u2019s too much that we don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nTo assess how transportation options affect low-income worker commutes, Replica may include demographic information such as deidentified credit- and census bureau data to estimate age range, race, gender, household size and income-levels. Portland\u2019s own data showing vehicle, bicycle and pedestrian counts, TriMet transit ridership data, and estimates from Metro\u2019s own travel model can also be added.\n\nHere\u2019s how Replica explains its data collection procedure:\n\nDe-identified mobile location data: We use de-identified mobile phone location data to generate travel behavior models \u2014 basically, a set of rules that represent how a person makes choices on where, when, why, and how to travel. Synthetic population generation: Separately, we use aggregate demographic information to create what planners call a \u201csynthetic population\u201d. This is a virtual population that is statistically representative of the real population. Computer simulation: We then give each person in the virtual population a travel behavior model and use computer simulation to generate a week of activities\u2013helping us confidently replicate trip patterns across a city or metro area.\n\nIn an effort to understand how people travel to and from Portland throughout the region, the Replica system will encompass Multnomah, Clackamas, Washington, and Clark Counties.\n\nOther cities including Chicago and Kansas City will also test Replica.\n\nPros and cons of a synthetic city population\n\nSome say they like this synthetic population approach because it provides a reflection of what\u2019s likely happening on city streets, arguably without the privacy invasions associated with surveillance and identifiable information. It\u2019s especially attractive when compared to how governments historically gather commuter information through studies that generate static data with a limited shelf-life.\n\nNow, the argument goes, they can skip the study and tap the replicated database to gauge the impact of a new light rail line or a street closure.\n\n\u201cThis is all information that we would otherwise have to collect by sending people out into the field to do counts and surveys, which is very expensive and time-consuming,\u201d said Rose.\n\nImportantly, with location data from mobile devices in people\u2019s pockets, they can track movement patterns of walkers, bikers, skaters and others not traveling in more-trackable vehicles. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen any tools that have offered the kind of information Sidewalk Labs is offering regarding pedestrian and cyclist mobility,\u201d said Rose.\n\nThe city will not receive any actual mobile location data through the pilot; rather, it accesses an online platform that allows staff to query and filter data based on the simulated population.\n\nDespite the privacy-safe assurances, data privacy and security experts question whether mobile location data, even when deidentified, is safe from re-identification if leaked, hacked or obtained by law enforcement. Others worry about the consequences of predictive modeling or machine learning techniques that determine with high levels of accuracy whether a simulated person might visit a particular location at a particular time.\n\n\u201cPeople who are moving within cities need to be able to trust that their data is truly de-identified and will never come back at them \u2014 for example, through a judicial process or law enforcement process \u2014 and would not be used against them in a discriminatory or unfair manner,\u201d said Dixon.\n\nAccording to a Portland Bureau of Transportation spokesperson, the contract with Sidewalk Labs prevents law enforcement or any entities other than Metro, PBOT or TriMet from accessing Replica software or data. But lots of data-related questions remain; rules dictating access to the information used to build the synthetic models, or the data reflecting their behavior, are unclear.\n\nPortland City Council voted to use the Replica software in December. The city now awaits an initial dataset from Sidewalk Labs that it will test against criteria the three agencies have devised, possibly by July. If it passes muster, it will begin paying 12 cents per resident to access the software for a year, receiving refreshed data each quarter.\n\nRose said the city is testing whether Replica can be used to identify people. \u201cIf we find that it can, we intend to terminate the agreement,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Portland City Council intended to vote on a privacy resolution requiring the city to ensure transparency and accountability in its data use and collection on Wednesday, but the vote was postponed.\n\nHow Replica got its start\n\nResearch partially funded by AT&T and the State of California Department of Transportation conducted at UC Berkeley and presented in a 2017 paper offers a glimpse into the origins of the Replica system. \u201cOne of our goals is to enable activity based travel demand models that use cellular data to create synthetic agent travel patterns without compromising the privacy of cell phone users,\u201d states the paper.\n\nOne of the researchers involved in the study, Alexei Pozdnoukhov, currently serves as director of research at Sidewalk Labs. Another researcher on the project mentioned his internships at Sidewalk Labs and AT&T in his dissertation.\n\nNot only was the research funded by AT&T, it employed data from the company, as confirmed by a Sidewalk Labs spokesperson. The paper notes the research employed anonymized and aggregated Call Detail Record logs \u201ccollected in Summer 2015 by a major mobile carrier in the US, serving millions of customers in the San Francisco Bay Area.\u201d CDR logs feature various details of mobile calls including time, duration, completion status, source number, and destination number. AT&T did not respond to requests to comment for this story.\n\nSeveral companies pool mobile location data over time to build models for things like ad targeting, marketing insights, or to help municipalities plan development. Those data providers rarely reveal where the information comes from.\n\nSidewalk Labs is not alone in its apparent use of raw cellphone data, which is made available to businesses directly from telcos as well as through third party data firms.\n\nA New York Times article this past December revealed how dozens of companies sell anonymous smartphone location data to advertisers, retailers, and even hedge funds, without the knowledge of individual users.\n\nSidewalk Labs launched in 2015 but has already drawn heat in conjunction with its highly-scrutinized partnership with a Toronto revitalization group aiming to turn the Quayside waterfront neighborhood into a \u201cglobal hub\u201d of \u201curban innovation.\u201d\n\nDespite introducing prototypes of heated hexagonal paving systems and \u201cbuilding raincoats\u201d that protect sidewalks from the elements, the plans for Toronto mostly remain a mystery. Local activists there express concerns about Sidewalk\u2019s lack of meaningful community engagement, as well as its proposal to fund Toronto land development and garner tax revenue through a controversial bond scheme.\n\nAll of the stakeholders have an interest in this data so it needs to be managed with the input of all of the stakeholders.\n\nIn April, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association filed a lawsuit against Waterfront Toronto and Canadian government entities, arguing that \u201cthe process that resulted in the Quayside agreements was not transparent, reasonable or accountable.\u201d Sidewalk Labs has also spurred criticism for its efforts to guide government policy for city data management.\n\nQuestions around city data use, ownership and security are immensely important. But the Sidewalk Labs partnership in Toronto also demonstrates the need to ensure that citizens can participate in decisions regarding technology use that ultimately affects government policy.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a different level of responsibility for municipalities,\u201d said Dixon. \u201cAll of the stakeholders have an interest in this data so it needs to be managed with the input of all of the stakeholders.\u201d\n\nWhether Portland city residents are aware of and understand the Replica project is questionable. When asked about government outreach involving Replica, PBOT pointed to the City Council\u2019s public hearing on the issue and a Civic Data Forum hosted in January by Smart City PDX, the city\u2019s group overseeing emerging tech projects in Portland. That event was intended to \u201cfoster engagement with and outreach to diverse stakeholders in the community impacted by data collection,\u201d according to the Smart City PDX website.\n\nThough it does not oversee the Replica project, Smart City PDX was created to guide Portland\u2019s data and technology investments. Smart City PDX Manager Kevin Martin admitted the city could do a better job of communicating the value proposition for tech projects such as Replica to residents.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s on us to really figure out how we better communicate,\u201d he said. \u201cHow innovations around data and technology can make your life better and how you need to work with us to make sure that things that happen with data and technology don\u2019t make your life worse.\u201d", "title": "Portland quietly launches mobile location data project with Alphabet\u2019s controversial Sidewalk Labs", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Portland']"}, {"id": 255, "city": "['San Antonio']", "url": "https://therivardreport.com/san-antonio-urban-design-paves-a-path-toward-widespread-obesity/", "text": "San Antonio\u2019s built environment does not support physical activity, promoting lifestyles that lead to obesity and a number of health problems. The inclusion of a micromobility lane for bikes and e-scooters as a part of the Broadway Street redevelopment project \u2013 a project supported by Mayor Ron Nirenberg \u2013 could be a catalyst for urban design that promotes public health. But the benefits can only be reaped if every zip code is included, starting with the most disadvantaged.\n\nResearch has found land use mix, minutes in a car, and distance walked as significant indicators of Body Mass Index (BMI) across all gender and ethnic groups, underscoring the importance of urban design. However, the urban design of San Antonio discourages physical activity, prioritizing drivers over walkers or bikers. Without protected bike lanes, well-maintained sidewalks, and reduced vehicle lanes, San Antonio scores 131.2 on the Pedestrian Danger Index in comparison to the national average of 55.3.\n\nAccording to the Active Living Council of San Antonio, 75 percent of Bexar county adults do not meet the 150-minute moderate-to-vigorous weekly physical activity requirement as cited by the Center for Health Statistics. While individual choices play a part, we must understand individual choices in the context of environment.\n\nIn Bexar County 65.7 percent of our adults and 32 percent of our adolescents are overweight or obese. What is even more alarming, is that the prevalence of obesity in Bexar County is disproportionately concentrated in the inner city (inside loop 410) and Southwest and Southside school districts. Not coincidentally, these areas, including zip codes 78202 and 78207, experience the city\u2019s highest concentrations of low-income and uninsured individuals.\n\nHealth care, however, is only one factor contributing to good health and its impact is limited. Decades of compelling research suggests that social determinants such as physical environment, socioeconomic status, education, and social networks play an overwhelmingly important role in explaining our health status.\n\nYet, the zip codes with the most to gain from multimodal streets are not being included. While the road north of Interstate 35 to Hildebrand Avenue is included in these plans, the mile leading south into downtown from Interstate 35 extending access to 78202 is not. The obesity rate in San Antonio cannot be expected to change if intervention is not applied to areas experiencing the highest prevalence. All San Antonio citizens should get easy access to health-promoting neighborhood conditions that support us in reaching and maintaining healthy BMI, but we need to start with neighborhoods that need the most support.\n\nIt\u2019s time we get serious about our health and the implementation of non-motorized linkages between residential, commercial, and employment areas as one important approach to improving the health of all San Antonio residents. Promoting active living spaces is important because evidence from Texas studies shows that school-based intervention promoting biking for students and parents has resulted in significantly increased recreational activity. Implementing urban design that promotes physical activity will simultaneously foster safety, equality, social cohesion, economic vibrancy, clean air, and employment in San Antonio.\n\nSan Antonio has already implemented an effective model of social and environmental change for public health. More than a decade ago, neighborhood groups, business associations, and residents joined together to support a tobacco ban in public areas. Preventing health risks attributed to obesity in the same way tobacco was identified as a leading cause of preventable disease must be a priority of San Antonio. Tobacco limits imposed from 2010 to June 2019 prioritize the health of those under 21 with limited restrictions of civil liberties for adults who choose to smoke. Our children deserve the same environmental protections from obesity as they do from tobacco.\n\nThe obesity epidemic will require changes social, economic, and built environments; the choice is to modify our society to accommodate obesity or health. Obesity intervention requires a social change from the individual to the collective. When we choose to value our health as well as our health care, we will collectively reap the physical, economic, and social benefits of health equity.", "title": "San Antonio Urban Design Paves a Path Toward Widespread Obesity", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['San Antonio']"}, {"id": 256, "city": "['San Antonio']", "url": "https://sanantonio.culturemap.com/news/city-life/07-09-19-urban-farm-grows-in-san-antonio-food-desert-garcia-street/#slide=0", "text": "A new urban farm is taking shape on San Antonio\u2019s East Side, designed to help fight food insecurity in an area where many residents lack access to fresh, healthy produce. On June 12, San Antonio Housing Authority, San Antonio College\u2019s William Sinkin Eco Centro, and Compost Queens gathered to break ground on the Garcia Street Urban Farm at 218 Garcia St.\n\nThe 4.1-acre urban farm will be one of the largest of its kind in San Antonio, and will serve as an educational and food production hub in a food desert. (Food deserts are classified as neighborhoods where most residents live more than one mile from the nearest supermarket.)\n\n\u201cToday, we celebrate a community resource that will address food insecurity and provide educational opportunities to help residents learn about healthy choices,\u201d David Nisivoccia, SAHA president and CEO, says in a press release.\n\nThe farm will grow a variety of crops, and contain a medicinal garden, pollinator gardens, a chicken coop, a picnic area, and an educational center. Project organizers focused on water and soil conservation in designing the farm in order to make it sustainable and to reduce flooding and drainage runoff.\n\nThe fruits and vegetables grown at Garcia Street Urban Farm will be offered to area residents, who will also be provided the chance to rent their own space to grow produce.\n\nResidents will be able to \u201cpay\u201d for their plot by contributing a portion of their harvest to the neighborhood, volunteering on the farm, or promoting healthy food options and urban farming to community members.\n\nFollowing 10 years in planning, this urban farm is part of SAHA\u2019s Choice Neighborhoods Critical Community Initiatives plan funded through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development\u2019s Choice Neighborhoods Implementation Grant.\n\nSAHA and other local partners have spent the last few years working to redevelop the former Wheatley Courts public housing complex into a mixed-income, high-quality community to revitalize this part of the East Side.\n\n\u201cIt takes one item of a neighborhood to be improved, to improve the entire block. It\u2019s a chain reaction,\u201d says Zuleika Morales-Romero, director of HUD\u2019s San Antonio field office.\n\nOnce farm construction is finished this fall, the Eco Centro will manage the farm in collaboration with Compost Queens. Eco Centro is a community outreach center for environmental sustainability. Compost Queens is a local compost recycling program that turns food waste into nutrient-rich soil.\n\nThis collaboration, project partners say, will result in opportunities for community members to engage in volunteerism, and to educate each other about healthy eating habits and urban agricultural research.\n\nThere\u2019s been an uptick in urban farming around San Antonio; some advocates feel urban farms such as the Garcia Street project can also spark employment opportunities in that more people will be compelled to launch similar farms elsewhere or become certified in urban agriculture and teach others best practices.\n\nThe Garcia Street farm isn't the only initiative underway to reduce food insecurity in San Antonio. District 3 City Councilwoman Rebecca Viagran recently launched a pilot program to invite corner stores to carry fresh fruits and vegetables at affordable prices.\n\nA handful of stores thus far have enrolled in the program, which currently focuses on the city\u2019s South Side. But local leaders hope it\u2019s successful so that more stores citywide, especially in low-income areas, will load up on fresh produce to increase people\u2019s immediate access to healthy, affordable, locally grown food.", "title": "New neighborhood urban farm crops up on San Antonio's East Side", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['San Antonio']"}, {"id": 257, "city": "['San Antonio', 'Austin']", "url": "https://www.texastribune.org/2019/08/13/whos-helping-homeless-more-austin-or-san-antonio/", "text": "*Correction appended\n\nJust a couple of months ago, Steve Harrell got a ticket just for sitting in downtown Austin. It was around 4:30 p.m. and he was among a group of other people experiencing homelessness when a police officer approached, pointed at him and issued the citation, he told officials at an Austin City Council meeting last month.\n\n\u201cThere has to be a better way,\u201d he said at the meeting.\n\nTwo weeks later, the law that got him the ticket was changed when the City Council reformed three municipal ordinances criticized for criminalizing homelessness.\n\nLying or sitting down in public is no longer prohibited as long as people don\u2019t block access to spaces. Simply asking for money is no longer illegal, though aggressive confrontations are. And sleeping in some public spaces (excluding parks and City Hall) is no longer banned, unless it is deemed to endanger someone\u2019s health or safety \u2014 or if it impedes the \u201creasonable use of a public area.\u201d\n\nDebate over the changes went until 2:20 a.m the day of the final vote. Some residents and business organizations, like the Austin Downtown Alliance, worried the updates would make the streets dirtier or make it more unsafe for some to walk at night.\n\n\u201cUntil you actually have safe places identified [for homeless people to stay], we don't understand why you're changing the ordinance,\u201d said Kimberly Levinson, vice president of the Downtown Austin Neighborhood Association.\n\nBut many people who showed up supported the measure. The council approved two of the ordinances unanimously and the camping ordinance passed with a 9-2 vote. The debate could have ended there. But it didn\u2019t.\n\nIn yet another episode of the ongoing fight between cities and the state, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott threatened to override the ordinances. Saying that \u201cthe horror stories are piling up,\u201d he shared a tweet that wrongly linked a car accident to a group of people experiencing homelessness running into traffic.\n\nLater, when asked by The Texas Tribune in a press conference about possible solutions to the issue, he pointed to the approach taken by San Antonio\u2019s largest homeless organization.\n\n\u201cThere are so many options that are available that are superior to people camping out on Congress Avenue,\u201d Abbott said. \u201cProbably the best template for this is a strategy that's been developed in San Antonio that I urge all communities to take a look at as the possible best practice. It's called Haven for Hope because what it does \u2014 it does not ignore the homeless; it helps the homeless be placed on a pathway toward recovery and improvement in their lives.\u201d\n\nBut while one of Haven for Hope\u2019s chief approaches to combating homelessness has helped keep people with nowhere else to go out of the city\u2019s downtown, experts say it doesn\u2019t follow what the evidence \u2014 or even what the federal government \u2014 suggests to help people find stable housing.\n\n\"Many of them would be downtown\"\n\nLatest in the Homeless in Texas series\n\nJust 10 minutes away from the Alamo, west of San Antonio\u2019s downtown, Haven for Hope\u2019s massive 22-acre campus is dedicated to taking care of people experiencing homelessness. Before Abbott referenced the group\u2019s approaches as an example for the state, he gave it the Governor\u2019s Volunteer Award in 2017.\n\nWith an annual budget of approximately $20 million, Haven for Hope serves around 1,700 people on any given day, according to CEO and President Kenny Wilson. Around 80% of people who seek help for homelessness in San Antonio come through Haven for Hope\u2019s $100 million campus, which has dormitories for men, women and families and an open sleeping area called the Prospect\u2019s Courtyard.\n\n\u201cThis is primarily people from the streets that can come in and stay with us one night or a year,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cAnd in both places, anyone who stays at Haven, they have access to good food, three great meals a day, hot meals, laundry, medical care and clothing.\u201d\n\nBrenda Mascorro is the executive director of the South Alamo Regional Alliance for the Homeless, the regional planning body in Bexar County that coordinates housing and services funding for homeless families and individuals. She said Haven for Hope\u2019s shelter and collaboration with 184 nonprofit partners is a critical part of San Antonio\u2019s response to the issue.\n\n\u201cThe benefits of Haven for Hope are vast,\u201d she said.\n\nWilson said 5,000 people have gone through Haven for Hope\u2019s \u201ctransformational program,\u201d where people experiencing homelessness are given personalized help finding places to live.\n\n\u201cWe follow them, and after a year about 90% of them are still in their home,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nBut not everyone agrees with the organization\u2019s approach. Program participants can be asked to take a urine test or a breathalyzer if alcohol or drug use is suspected. If people are intoxicated or high, they can\u2019t enter the campus until they are sober. Once sober, they will meet with a treatment team to discuss the situation and analyze if treatment is needed.\n\nThis approach contradicts the current trend in homelessness services, which instead aims to find housing \u2014 despite conditions like alcoholism or drug use \u2014 and then focus on solving other problems through support services. This is what experts call the \u201chousing first\u201d model.\n\nIn the last two decades, dozens of studies have quantified what many say is the model\u2019s positive impact. The American Journal of Public Health published a study in 2004 that found around 80% of people helped through the housing first model remained housed after two years.\n\nAt the same time, research suggests that model saves taxpayers by cutting the costs of jailing or providing health care to people experiencing homelessness. A study published in 2006 found that in Denver, the approach led to a decline in emergency room visits that saved $31,545 per program participant. And incarceration days and costs were reduced by 76%.\n\nThe model is used elsewhere in Texas, including in Houston, which has been successful in cutting its rate of people experiencing homelessness. And the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has adopted it as policy since George W. Bush\u2019s administration. Current HUD Secretary Ben Carson supports it, and the agency considers its use a priority.\n\n\u201cWhile it might be more expensive because you are providing housing, it ends up saving money,\u201d said Gary Painter, director of the Homelessness Policy Research Institute at the University of Southern California. \u201cIt is at least [as] cost effective as the other model and also certainly much more effective\u201d in terms of keeping people housed, he said. \u201cIf you get an outcome that is far more better without more costs, why wouldn\u2019t you do it?\u201d\n\nWilson, with Haven for Hope, said that his organization partially relies on the housing first approach, through services offered by the organization\u2019s partners. But he added that \u201cthere is no one way to solve homelessness.\u201d He said that he has seen people get sober, find a place to live and then relapse.\n\n\u201cThe downside of just saying, \u2018Get people in a house,\u2019 is their needs are so profound, so deep, so lengthy,\u201d Wilson said.\n\nBut some people disagree with another aspect: having one massive shelter for a major city. The national trend is to have multiple smaller shelters.\n\n\u201cHaven for Hope is a big shelter with a big budget, but it does not end homelessness,\u201d said Robert Friant, managing director for the Corporation for Supportive Housing, a New York-based organization that finances and consults on homelessness and housing. \u201cShelters don\u2019t end homelessness. We need affordable housing. And what I\u2019m conveying is evidence based. Homes end homelessness.\u201d\n\nThe Texas Homeless Network, the non-profit that coordinates homeless efforts across the state, values the work done in Haven for Hope, but emphasized that the goal is to find permanent housing for everyone experiencing homelessness.\n\n\u201cMany communities have had success with ending homelessness for special populations but housing was the key piece. Houston, Austin, San Antonio, and most recently Abilene, have all effectively ended Veteran homelessness by securing housing and placing people in those units quickly. We know this can be replicated in other areas and with other subpopulations but we need housing,\u201d the organization said in a statement.\n\nIn San Antonio, the number of people experiencing homelessness has remained more or less stable since the subprime mortgage crisis ended. Although the annual count is hardly a precise census, it does underscore that San Antonio hasn\u2019t been able to decrease its homeless population the way Houston has.\n\nStill, San Antonio has seen a visible change in the city\u2019s urban core.\n\n\u201cHomelessness in downtown San Antonio has dropped about 80% since San Antonio Haven for Hope opened,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cWe're near downtown, as I said, and we have 1,700 people here. I often wonder where would they be if they weren't here. And many of them would be downtown and on the River Walk, in front of the hotels.\u201d\n\nMultiple shelters and permanent housing\n\nSince the approval of Austin\u2019s reworked ordinances, Downtown Austin Alliance workers have seen the number of encounters with people sleeping or lying in public areas in the business district rise from 2,000 to 4,000 a month, CEO Dewitt Peart said at a forum organized by KUT radio earlier this month.\n\nBut at the same KUT event, Mayor Steve Adler strongly defended the policy.\n\n\u201cWe haven\u2019t created any more people experiencing homelessness over the last month. Now they are more visible,\u201d Adler said, \u201cbut it is still the same person that needs a place to stay.\u201d\n\nThe mayor said previous versions of the ordinances were costly to the city at a time when market-driven housing prices are rising for residents.\n\n\"I am tired of wasting taxpayer dollars not addressing this situation and just moving people around that are trying to comply, but living in a city where it is impossible,\" Adler said.\n\nAustin\u2019s approach has been to steer funds toward multiple shelters and permanent housing before addressing other issues like substance abuse.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so expensive to shelter people without having the resources to get them out and back to housing and to the community,\u201d said Ann Howard, who recently stepped down as executive director of Austin\u2019s Ending Community Homelessness Coalition to run for the Travis County Commissioners Court. \u201cIt really comes down to money: Those huge campuses become intractable.\u201d\n\nCity officials will discuss opening one shelter in each City Council district. In June, the council approved the construction of a new center in South Austin.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a housing focused center, that people go through and not to,\u201d council member Ann Kitchen said at the KUT forum. \u201cIt\u2019s a safe, welcoming place to live and be connected to services to help them get to permanent housing.\u201d\n\nAustin plans to spend $15.3 million of the city\u2019s next budget in homelessness relief. That includes money for rental assistance, legal aid and the new shelter that the city recently approved.\n\nAnd the local homeless organizations are also partnering for a \u201cpay for success\u201d project, a new approach in Texas through which financial institutions, foundations and a health-focused organization would fund housing and assistance for 250 individuals that have been in and out of jails and hospitals. The success of the interventions will be measured with data related to recidivism, the amount of emergency room visits and how many individuals remain housed. If it is successful, investors get their money back. This way, the financial risk of the intervention doesn\u2019t fall on the government.\n\n\u201cRepublicans and Democrats can work together on it because it's fiscally conservative for the government, since it shifts the risk\u201d away from taxpayers, Howard says. \u201cThe hope is that if the data proves that this permanent supportive housing helps, then we expect that governments will fund this and let go of funding things that they don't have data for or that don\u2019t prove out.\u201d\n\nLara Korte contributed to this report.\n\nDisclosure: Steve Adler, a former board member of The Texas Tribune, has also been a financial supporter of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.

Ask a Texas state trooper\n\nThe proposal\u2019s goal \u201cis to reduce the number of weapons that could fall into the hands of bad actors or mentally unstable persons through illegal gun transfers, theft or accidental means,\u201d according to a memo from the council members.\n\n\u201cTo my way of thinking, if we get one gun off the streets that saves the life of one person, then that is invaluable,\u201d Courage said.\n\nOnce the city buys guns, it would take them out of circulation by destroying them.\n\nAndrews-Sullivan did not comment Monday.\n\nThe two council members plan to announce details of their proposal Tuesday.\n\nThe two proposed the buyback program about three weeks after a gunman fatally shot 22 people at an El Paso mall. Last year, another gunman killed eight students and two teachers at Santa Fe High School near Houston. A third gunman killed 26 people at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, about 35 miles southeast of San Antonio, in 2017.\n\nThe council members hope the program, if passed, will help prevent homicides, mass shootings, suicides and instances of shooting deaths in domestic abuse cases.\n\nAlthough interest in gun buyback programs usually ticks up in the wake of mass shootings, several studies have failed to show that buybacks prompt decreases in gun violence.\n\nOn ExpressNews.com: San Antonio lawmaker rolls out gun reforms as City Council calls for special session on firearms\n\nFor example, a 2002 study found that buyback programs in Milwaukee County in Wisconsin didn\u2019t turn up the kinds of guns usually used in homicides and suicides. Another study, analyzing Seattle\u2019s 1992 buyback program, was inconclusive about whether it meaningfully curtailed violent crime and deaths caused by firearms.\n\nCourage acknowledged those studies\u2019 findings but said he hopes the program will generally improve public safety even if it doesn\u2019t cause crime rates to drop. Those with \u201ccriminal tendencies\u201d won\u2019t likely sell guns to the city, he said.\n\n\u201cIf they have those tendencies, whether they turn in a gun to us or not, they\u2019ll find their way,\u201d Courage said. \u201cBut they won\u2019t find their way with the guns that we take.\u201d\n\nWhether the city would pay cash or use some other method for buying the guns remains to be seen, Courage said.\n\nThe Fort Worth Police Department gave out $50 gift cards rather than cash during its buyback program in 2017, according to a report by Texas Standard and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting. The idea is to prevent people from turning around and buying more guns.\n\nSan Antonio police officers seized 736 firearms last year from criminals, according to a Police Department budget presentation last week \u2014 a figure Courage said he hopes the voluntary buyback program matches.\n\nPolice spokesman Jesse Salame did not immediately have figures available showing how many guns the department destroyed or sold in that time frame.\n\nOn ExpressNews.com: Texas lawmakers take up background checks, \u2018straw\u2019 purchases after El Paso mass shooting\n\nSan Antonio has had at least one gun buyback program in the past two decades. The San Antonio Housing Authority spent more than $36,000 \u2014 including about $11,000 in funds from the Housing and Urban Development Department \u2014 to purchase about 430 guns in 2000.\n\nSo far, the proposal has gotten buy-in from at least three other council members \u2014 Ana Sandoval, Adriana Rocha Garcia and Manny Pel\u00e1ez \u2014 who signed onto the proposal last week.\n\nAt least one legislator has proposed a statewide gun buyback program. State Rep. Roland Gutierrez, D-San Antonio, included a $10 million gun buyback program in a series of proposed gun reforms he rolled out earlier this month.\n\nJoshua Fechter is a staff writer covering San Antonio city government and politics.

The team is also building upon the strategy of SmartSA : to leverage new and emerging technologies and data to improve the quality of life for all San Antonians. SmartSA partners include CPS Energy, the San Antonio Water System (SAWS), the San Antonio River Authority (SARA), and VIA Metropolitan Transit.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe City of San Antonio, in collaboration with our SmartSA partners, is driving forward a smart city 3.0 model that prioritizes community input regarding challenges that our constituency faces every day. We acknowledge that we can\u2019t tackle these issues alone, which is why we are excited about partnerships like the one we now have with UTSA via the MetroLab network. Their expertise and energy will help ensure we remain inclusive, forward-thinking, and even more impactful in this space of urban innovation,\u201d said Brian Dillard, chief innovation officer for the City of San Antonio.\n\nRecent projects include the delivery of the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan (CAAP) of which UTSA scholars helped co-author. This was a project undertaken by COSA, CPS Energy, UTSA and the Texas Sustainable Energy Research Institute to integrate environmental stewardship and social equity. This included establishing a baseline inventory for greenhouse gases, developing future emission scenes, identifying mitigation strategies, assessing impacts throughout the city, and creating an implementation plan. This plan is currently under review by the San Antonio City Council and is open to public comments from city residents.\n\nAnother successful project was the \u201cUnder 1 Roof\u201d program, which replaces worn and damaged roofs for disadvantaged homeowners and installs light-colored shingles and a radiant barrier. The goals were not only to address life/safety issues and improve health outcomes but also improve energy efficiency and reduce utility bills, while demonstrating the benefits of cool roofs for builders and residents. The program also offset the urban heat island effect by selecting homes that were clustered together. For each roof that was installed, data (utility, attic and roof temperatures) was collected and analyzed to assess the effectiveness of the program, which saw reductions in energy usage and cost savings to the homeowner.\n\nDesignated by the San Antonio City Council, the first Innovation Zones have been established in three key areas of the city: Brooks in the Southeast, the South Texas Medical Center in the Northwest, and Downtown. These zones will be used as proving grounds to test various types of smart city technology which could include: autonomous vehicles, smart streetlights, and various sensors. The goal is to address issues identified by local residents and stakeholders, prioritizing sustainability, access to services, and mobility.\n\nThe next project will hone in on the Digital Divide in San Antonio. The National Digital Inclusion Alliance found the city ranks 42nd out of 186 cities with 37.5% of household lacking access to broadband internet at home. The long term goal is to improve access and training opportunities to ensure citizens have the ability to interact with various digital platforms, for improved communication and better services for future implementations and ensuring all voices are represented and captured. The plan includes a way to share the data collected in a meaningful way via an accessible platform available to all stakeholders including residents.\n\nThe City of San Antonio will continue to work with their partners and the community to identify and define the issues, expand the aforementioned projects, and seek third-party funding through grants and awards. UTSA will be pulling experts from all colleges and disciplines where applicable with an emphasis on working with researchers from the College of Public Policy; Architecture, Construction & Planning including its Center for Urban and Regional Planning Research; Engineering; and the future School of Data Science.\n\n\u201cOver the past decade, UTSA has focused on research pertaining to sustainable communities and critical infrastructure, everything from water studies to low impact development, from smart grids and smart cities to sustainable economic development.

And, of course, it\u2019ll take time.\u201d\n\nOn ExpressNews.com: Details of proposed Hays Street Bridge land swap revealed\n\nThe proposal covers a J-shaped, 3.7-square-mile area that stretches from Interstate 10, encompasses neighborhoods directly north of downtown and the Pearl and runs along Broadway, stopping just north of the University of the Incarnate Word (UIW).\n\nAmong the potential land uses envisioned by a 21-member planning team \u2014 made up of neighborhood leaders, land developers and local education officials \u2014 are two \u201ccatalytic projects\u201d along San Pedro Avenue. One would overhaul the corridor over the next two decades from a car-friendly environment dominated by fast-food restaurants and gas stations to one more amenable to pedestrians.\n\nA mixed-use \u201cgateway\u201d with apartments, townhomes and ground-floor retail would take up three blocks along San Pedro south of Marshall Street \u2014 an area currently dominated by fast-food restaurants and a QuikTrip gas station. Roughly a half mile north, VIA Metropolitan Transit\u2019s 30.6-acre site at 1021 San Pedro \u2014 in addition to its offices and bus maintenance operations \u2014 could include residences, retail and a trail connecting San Pedro Springs Park and Fredericksburg Road.\n\nSan Pedro isn\u2019t the only midtown thoroughfare targeted for a potential makeover. The planning team identified Flores Street, Fredericksburg Road and Main and McCullough avenues just north of downtown as possible mixed-use \u201cgateways\u201d that would be prime spots for office, retail and residential development in the coming years.\n\nOn ExpressNews.com: Financial troubles mount for owner of closed Viva Tacoland\n\nThe city is also preparing for development along the lower Broadway corridor near the Pearl and northward along Brackenridge Park toward Witte Museum and UIW. The plan designates the preferred future use of land south of Hildebrand Avenue along Broadway as mixed-use.\n\nAnd the entertainment district on St. Mary\u2019s Street \u2014 home to bars and live music venues like Paper Tiger and Limelight \u2014 would remain concentrated north of Josephine Street while the city encourages the establishment of more restaurants and retailers along the strip that operate during the day. City policy would support residential development along the half-mile stretch of St. Mary\u2019s between Interstate 35 and Josephine.\n\nThe document directs city officials to adopt policies that bolster the area\u2019s existing jobs base in the education, health care and service industries anchored by UIW, San Antonio College and Metropolitan Methodist Hospital and the St. Mary\u2019s and Fredericksburg arts and entertainment districts.\n\nThe proposed plan mostly limits mixed-use development to main thoroughfares, away from residential areas in Tobin Hill, Five Points, Mahncke Park and Westfort \u2014 and discourages zoning changes in those neighborhoods. But the proposal also urges more housing options in the Midtown region for students, families and seniors at affordable rates.\n\n\u201cI think you have to be mindful of what\u2019s there and the fact that we have to provide the housing, but also respect the longtime residents who are there, who live there, who have been there for a while,\u201d White said.\n\nOn ExpressNews.com: It\u2019s getting more expensive to own a home in Texas\n\nBut some members of the planning team that drafted the Midtown document are skeptical that the proposed strategies would help neighborhoods maintain their character and prevent displacement of residents with deep roots.\n\nNot part of the discussion was how desired development outlined in the proposal would impact property values in areas that are already seeing those values skyrocket, said Mike Austin, a representative of the Tobin Hill Community Association.\n\n\u201cThe residential aspect of Tobin Hill is going to be diminished over years,\u201d Austin said. \u201cIt\u2019s just going to be difficult for people to afford.\u201d\n\nAlso unclear is how the proposal\u2019s strategies would affect the area\u2019s low-income residents, including senior citizens who live in facilities between McCullough and San Pedro, said Graciela Sanchez, director of the Esperanza Peace & Justice Center. Sanchez said she fears the proposal\u2019s emphasis on mixed-use, inspired by the Pearl, will ultimately homogenize the area.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a space that\u2019s not meant for me and I don\u2019t feel that it is mine,\u201d Sanchez said of the Pearl. \u201cIf that is the vision for the rest of the city or for other regions, it changes what San Antonio is about.\u201d\n\nJoshua Fechter is a San Antonio-based staff writer covering real estate, economic development and philanthropy.

The former Union Pacific Railyards spans 244-acres just north of downtown Sacramento, California,\u2014the largest urban infill site in the country\u2014and is currently being eyed for several large-scale projects.\n\nBuilt in the 1860s, the site served the western terminus of a 1,912-mile-long stretch of rail line that extended from Council Bluffs, Iowa, to the Oakland Long Wharf in San Francisco Bay. Old, existing brick buildings used as maintenance shops in the yard\u2019s heyday still exist on the massive industrial plot and serve up sour views for drivers along Interstate 5 or passengers on flights headed into the nearby airport.\n\nSacramento has long had a difficult relationship with the Railyards\u2014environmental remediation has been ongoing for decades\u2014but recent investment in the adjacent Downtown Commons district has brought in significant interest in revamping the underused land next door. For example, the Golden 1 Center, a new high-tech arena for the city\u2019s NBA franchise, the Sacramento Kings, finished up construction in 2016 and has spurred the introduction of new hotels and businesses in the area.\n\nAround the same time the venue was completed, the local city council approved a planning entitlement submitted by Downtown Railyard Ventures, a subsidiary of the development group, LDK Ventures, that bought the Railyards in 2010 for $18 million. The ambitious company has a masterplan to make the Union Pacific return to its roots as a central hub of activity and innovation.\n\nIn the next several decades, The Railyards, as the project is formally being marketed, will become a mixed-use urban landscape made to attract local residents, tech workers, and tourists. In total, there\u2019s set to be 30 acres of green space, 70,000 square feet of retail, up to 10,000 residential units, 5 million square feet of office space, a 1,000-room hotel, and a mass transit hub with a new Amtrak station.\n\nPreservation will be a key component of redevelopment on the site\u2014unlike at Hudson Yards\u2014with the partial reuse of the \u201cCentral Shops\u201d buildings and the old Southern Pacific Sacramento Depot. It\u2019s suspected that this area will become some sort of tech district for the city. In addition, three major architectural projects already in the works will anchor the initial phase of development.\n\nBy far the biggest and most-talked-about development coming to Sacramento is a new, $250 million soccer stadium for a future MLS franchise. The city has been in talks to upgrade its own team, Republic FC, to major league status now that it\u2019s secured long-term funding from billionaire businessman Ron Burkle. The proposed development would include a 20,000-seat sports and entertainment arena situated on 14-acres of the Railyards\u2019 northeastern corner, as well as a surrounding 17-acres of commercial buildings and retail.\n\nVisuals for the project have already been revealed by architecture and infrastructure engineering firm HNTB and feature a square-shaped, open-air bowl with red inverted triangles that wrap and protect a 360-degree canopy. Fans will have unencumbered views of the surrounding city from anywhere around the pitch.\n\nHousing is planned in between the arena and an upcoming 900,000-square-foot hospital by Kaiser Permanente. The healthcare giant announced in January that it had purchased 18 acres of land to build a state-of-the-art medical facility on the northwestern edge of the Railyards that will open in 2025 and offer services to the thousands of people who live downtown.\n\nOther structures slated to come online include a light rail stop, two six-story office and retail buildings by RMW Architecture & Interiors, as well as a 175,000-square-foot museum. On the southernmost portion of the Railyards, there will be a 17-story complex housing the Sacramento County Courthouse.

And while trendy farmers markets and the \u201ceat local\u201d movement have had a part in perpetuating food inequities, a number of organizations in the California capital are working to expand access to healthy eating. The city itself has issued a call for proposals to revitalize its abandoned tree nursery so that more residents can grow their own healthy food and learn job skills related to farming while they\u2019re at it.\n\n\u201cThe biggest thing about urban agriculture, like scaling up from personal, is land access,\u201d says Chanowk Yisrael, a farmer working half an acre of land in the South Oak Park neighborhood of Sacramento. \u201cEven though we\u2019re the farm-to-fork capital,\u201d Yisrael says, \u201cmost of that is more for the commercial side. You\u2019re talking about fine dining and foodies and those types of things.\u201d\n\nYisrael and his wife, Judith, own the Yisrael Family Farm, which runs a program called G.O.O.D.: Growing Our Own Destiny. According to its website, the Yisrael farm has helped 40 people establish gardens in their yards over the past few years. The farm also offers classes on healthy eating habits and gives tours to introduce children and adults to the growing process from seeding to weeding and harvesting. Yisrael says that his neighborhood has a few acres of abandoned lots that could be used for gardening and farming. The challenge, he says, is that most of these lots don\u2019t have water, and utility hookups can cost up to $6,000.\n\nThe Sacramento region\u2019s Center for Land-Based Learning helps with land access and has educated high-school students from 27 counties in California about the food system and sustainable agriculture. In 2010, the organization expanded to work with adults thanks to funding allocated in the 2008 farm bill. After a seven-month farmer training program, participants move on to a business incubator.\n\n\u201cWe, as a nonprofit, lease land, and then we kind of set it up so that it\u2019s all ready to be farmed,\u201d says Mary Kimball, the Center\u2019s executive director. The organization takes care of irrigation systems, washing facilities and storage structures. Additionally, it provides the new farmers with equipment. The Center doesn\u2019t cover all their costs, but the support helps farmers to get started.\n\n(Courtesy Alchemist Community Development Corporation)\n\nMany of these incubator sites, Kimball says, are in food deserts, and many of the farmers who go through the training come from cities. Five farm sites, she says, are in West Sacramento where \u201cthey don\u2019t have access, not just to food, but to fresh fruits and vegetables, healthy food.\u201d\n\nWith its most recent graduating class, which completed the course in mid-September, the Center for Land-Based Learning has trained 150 farmers, and Kimball says 65 percent of those graduates continue to work in agriculture-related fields.\n\nBeing able to grow your own vegetables, however, shouldn\u2019t be a prerequisite for getting access to healthy food. That\u2019s one reason why Alchemist Community Development Corporation, which has a community garden with 15 plots in the Oak Park area of Sacramento, runs a program to boost residents\u2019 buying power at farmers markets. Shoppers using CalFresh (SNAP benefits) get a 100 percent match when spending on fresh fruits and vegetables. In other words, spend $10 and get $20 worth of healthy eats. According to Sarah Dillon of Alchemist, the organization distributed $20,000 in matches across the 11 farmers markets in the Sacramento region in August 2019.\n\nThe city of Sacramento, meanwhile, is eyeing residents interested in cultivating their own food as it seeks proposals for transforming a 5-acre vacant tree nursery into a farming center in the Mangan Park neighborhood. Jennifer Venema, of the city\u2019s sustainability office, says she expects five to 10 farmers could work the land. Venema says they hope to receive proposals that embrace a range of activities, from food growing to training and more.\n\n\u201cIt means people in the neighborhood have access and can come in and grow things or buy things, and we really want to include learning and educational opportunities,\u201d Venema says. \u201cHaving land is the big barrier for a lot of the small-scale, ag entrepreneurs. But having land is just one step. There\u2019s a lot to getting that land ready.\u201d\n\nIn addition to echoing Yisrael\u2019s caveat about water access, Venema points out that vacant land often needs toxic substance remediation. The tree nursery, for example, took some time to be ready for the call for proposals in part because it is near a now-defunct gun range, and the ammunition needed to be removed to ensure that the soil wouldn\u2019t transmit toxins to the food grown there.\n\nVenema says that, although the funds will require approval by the city council, the expectation is that Sacramento will invest approximately $200,000 to revitalize the site. \u201cThe goal is to get someone that\u2019s self-sustaining once we get the site prepared,\u201d Venema says.\n\nUPDATE: This article was changed to add information about Alchemist CDC\u2019s match for CalFresh recipients, and to clarify that Center for Land-Based Learning covers only some of the startup costs for farmers.", "title": "Making Sacramento the \u201cFarm-to-Every-Fork\u201d Capital", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Sacramento']"}, {"id": 264, "city": "['Sacramento']", "url": "http://beyondchron.org/the-housing-crisis-hits-sacramento/", "text": "by on\n\nCity Must Respond to Loss of Affordability\n\nI\u2019m doing two talks about Generation Priced Out: Who Gets to Live in the New Urban America in Sacramento on September 10 addressing the city\u2019s affordability crisis. My timing is fitting, as Sacramento now reflects a new urban America where long affordable housing is no more.\n\nAfter decades in which the Bay Area\u2019s rising rents and home prices did not reach the state capitol, the affordability crisis has hit Sacramento hard. The days of cheap Sacramento rents are gone, and now the city must aggressively work to preserve its racial and economic diversity.\n\nAccording to an article last week in the Sacramento Bee, rents in the city have risen 45% in the past seven years. This vaulted the city from the 45th most expensive metro area to the 11th.\n\nFortunately, Sacramento tenant advocates aggressively responded to the crisis by collecting 44,000 signatures to qualify a rent control and just cause eviction measure for the March 2020 ballot. This led the City Council to make a deal whereby the ordinance campaign would be dropped in exchange for the Council passing its own just rent control and just cause eviction law. The big difference is that the Council\u2019s law limits annual rent increases to 6 percent plus inflation (which will likely mean a total of roughly 9% in the next year) while the ballot measure capped rent hikes at 5%.\n\nTo give some perspective, a ballot measure I co-authored in San Francisco in 1992 limits rent increases to 60% of inflation. San Francisco tenants have typically paid only 1-2% rent hikes since our Prop H initiative passed (I discuss the Prop H campaign in The Activist\u2019s Handbook).\n\nSacramento tenants will likely pay almost four times higher annual rent increases than those in San Francisco. But San Francisco rent control started with a 7% annual increase, and higher increases took effect if the tenant failed to file a petition challenging the illegal hike. So one could say that Sacramento\u2019s negotiated deal puts tenants in a better place than San Francisco tenants were in 1979.\n\nIt\u2019s also true that the passage of AB 1482 would put Sacramento tenants in close to the same position they gained from striking the rent control deal. That will increase pressure on the City Council to reduce rent hikes locally.\n\nStudents at Sacramento State University, where I\u2019ll be speaking at the University Library at 3pm, have been hit particularly hard by rising rents. Sacramento State Dean of Students Beth Lesen told the Bee in the article above, \u201cWe\u2019re starting to look at things that we haven\u2019t looked at before because we really just need our students to be housed. None of us ever expected to be in the business of finding affordable housing for students when we got into higher education.\u201d\n\nHer comments will surprise those who attended college in the greater Bay Area or Los Angeles, but they show how quickly longtime affordable Sacramento began pricing students out. It reminds me of what happened to another state capitol, Austin, Texas, as seemingly overnight it shifted from affordable to slackers to unaffordable to all those without high-paying jobs.\n\nSacramento\u2019s Challenge\n\nIn November 2018, Sacramento passed Measure U, a 1/2 cent sales tax increase. Longtime housing activist Cathy Creswell, a member of the Measure U Advisory Committee, urged the new funds to be used for housing. \u201cThe growing crisis highlighted in this report must compel the city to make significant new investments in the development of affordable homes, especially for renters of modest means, and to provide safe and stable homes for people experiencing homelessness.\u201d\n\nSacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg agreed with Creswell. He stated in May that \u201cMeasure U gives us the opportunity to have a real Housing Trust Fund that will allow us to help bridge the funding gap for projects that will address the severe shortage of affordable housing for our residents,\u201d Steinberg said. \u201cThank you to the Sacramento Housing Alliance for recommending a comprehensive approach to this statewide crisis, of which a local funding source is a key piece.\u201d\n\nBut as Los Angeles showed, passing funding measures for affordable housing does not end opposition to specific projects. Long affordable cities often have a hard time adjusting to new housing realities. And they worsen the crisis by refusing to take necessary actions to boost affordability.\n\nConsider the Sacramento City Council\u2019s unanimous rejection in September 2018 of a 24-unit 100% affordable project, the Luther Garden Apartments. The project was planned for a vacant field in a low-income neighborhood.\n\nWhy did the Council reject it? Check out the CBS news story on \u201cthe housing solution the city rejected.\u201d\n\nThe member representing the area said \u201cno doubt we need housing. But we need the right kind of housing.\u201d Why was a 100% affordable project in a city facing skyrocketing private market rents not the \u201cright kind\u201d? According to one council member the 24 units made it \u201ctoo dense.\u201d\n\nThe real reason? The project was in a neighborhood zoned for single-family homes only. And those homeowners did not want tenants living in their neighborhood (one opponent said the area lacked appropriate \u201cservices\u201d for seniors.\u201d\n\nThe council\u2019s vote preceded Measure U but reflects a deeper sense of denial about the city\u2019s changed affordability future. As Austin, Culver City, and so many other longtime affordable areas show, Sacramento\u2019s days as the affordable alternative to the Bay Area are gone. But that does not mean the city cannot steadily expand housing options for the working and middle-class and work to get federal and state assistance for low-income residents who need such help.\n\nI wrote Generation Priced Out to address precisely the situation Sacramento finds itself in today. And I look forward to talking about solutions to the city\u2019s affordability crisis in two events on September 10: 3pm at the CSUS University Library in an event I am doing for the Friends of the CSUS Library. And at 5pm at Avid Reader on Broadway.\n\nI hope those concerned about Sacramento\u2019s future can join us.\n\nRandy Shaw is Editor of Beyond Chron.

Any opportunity we have to push back on the 85th percentile rule, we should take.\u201d\n\nThe \u201c85th percentile rule\u201d is the way current law requires that speed limits be set, a backwards method with the sole goal of preventing speed traps rather than improving safety. The rule tends to force cities to raise speed limits if they want to enforce them, and makes it very difficult to lower them.\n\nExcept in school zones. The California Vehicle Code allows a local jurisdiction to establish a speed limit as low as fifteen miles per hour:\n\nwhen children are present\n\non local residential streets, within 500 feet of a school\n\nwhen the maximum speed on nearby streets is thirty miles per hour\n\nand when the road is no more than two lanes wide.\n\n\u201cLowering speeds near schools is another big step towards our Vision Zero goal,\u201d said Hansen. \u201cAddressing vehicle speed is one of the clearest ways we identified to reduce traffic deaths and serious injuries. I\u2019m proud of our Public Works Team for this big win for our kids.\u201d\n\nSacramento has a high rate of traffic-related injuries, and\u2013according to the California Office of Traffic Safety 2016 rankings\u2013the highest number of speed-related injuries and deaths in the state. The city\u2019s Vision Zero plan specifically calls out high speeds as a major factor in traffic-related injuries and fatalities.\n\nA NHTSA study\u2013one of many such\u2013found that fatality and serious injury rates increase substantially as travel speeds rise. It\u2019s bad enough when a child is hit by a vehicle traveling less than 20 mph, but once a vehicle\u2019s speed reaches 21, the rate of serious or fatal injuries doubles.\n\nStatewide, school zones generally have a 25mph limit, unless otherwise indicated. The Sacramento City Council\u2019s action will add new 15-mph speed limit signs on 225 street segments near 124 city schools.\n\nJennifer Donlon-Wyant, an active transportation planner with the city of Sacramento, was part of the team that submitted the proposal to the city council for approval. \u201cThe city of Sacramento is committed to implementing our adopted Vision Zero actions,\u201d she said, \u201cand will take bold citywide actions like reducing our speed limits in all eligible school zones to 15 miles an hour.\u201d\n\nMorning drop-off times can bring heavy traffic to schools. One of the Vision Zero plan\u2019s long-term goal is reducing the amount of vehicle traffic, and one way to get there is to make it safer for everyone who is not in a car. Reducing speed limits is the first step.", "title": "City of Sacramento Reduces Speed Limits Near Schools to 15 mph", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "['street_safety']", "annot_city": "['Sacramento']"}, {"id": 266, "city": "['Sacramento']", "url": "https://cal.streetsblog.org/2019/06/12/city-of-sacramento-approves-free-transit-pass-program-for-all-students/", "text": "City of Sacramento Approves Free Transit Pass Program for All Students\n\nNote: GJEL Accident Attorneys regularly sponsors coverage on Streetsblog San Francisco and Streetsblog California. Unless noted in the story, GJEL Accident Attorneys is not consulted for the content or editorial direction of the sponsored content.\n\nBeginning in October, all students in grades K through 12 who live in or go to school in the city of Sacramento will be able to get a free pass on all Sacramento Regional Transit District (SacRT) buses and light rail. The program will last for a year, during which time it will be evaluated and potentially renewed.\n\nThe City of Sacramento will provide $1 million from its general fund to offset any potential revenue losses to SacRT. The general fund is supported in part by Measure U, a one-cent sales tax that has been approved and extended by city residents. The city invests some of that funding in an equity investment fund, for safety, housing and youth services and programming.\n\nA transit pass program for students falls squarely in that pocket. The pass could potentially be used by 100,000 students, although SacRT estimates student ridership will likely rise to about 40,000 daily riders.\n\n\u201cIt will make a big difference n the lives of young people and their communities,\u201d said Sacramento City Councilmember Jay Schenirer, who championed the program. \u201cThis is an important investment in our neighborhoods, in our young people, and in our economy.\u201d\n\nAttendance problems and chronic absenteeism, he said, is frequently due to difficulties getting to school. Reducing those issues could help increase funding to schools from the state, since it is based on Average Daily Attendance. \u201cIt\u2019s a win for SacRT, for the schools, for economic development\u2013it\u2019s absolutely good for young people to be able to get where they\u2019re going,\u201d said Schenirer. \u201cAnd it\u2019s good for the climate too. We could make a significant dent in vehicle miles traveled if we can reduce the number of school trips.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd if we can create lifetime public transit riders, investing this money now will pay off over time, once these kids become adults and know that riding transit is a good way to get around.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt will make a big difference in the lives of young people and their communities.\u201d\n\nOther cities have been creating similar fare-free programs. The city of L.A. just announced free passes for students on DASH buses, though not Metro. Other areas, notably San Francisco and Alameda County, have created programs to offer free transit to low-income students, but have found that the administrative costs of proving eligibility can be onerous.\n\nTwo years ago, Merced offered free rides to all transit riders during the month of August, and saw ridership spike. Colleges in many cities throughout the state have created student transit pass programs, which provide deeply discounted transit passes that have been found to benefit both transit agencies\u2013who gain a reliable source of revenue and increases in ridership\u2013and riders, who can hop on transit without having to scrounge for money for each ride.\n\nOver the course of several recent legislative sessions, Assemblymember Chris Holden tried to create a statewide student transit pass program. But his attempts found tepid support in the legislature, with even less interest in providing funding. The latest student transit pass bill, A.B. 17, was vetoed by then-governor Jerry Brown, who said a \u201cfuller discussion\u201d was needed before a statewide program could be created.\n\nThe reason many of these programs are not more widespread could come down to disagreements over funding. Most of the ones listed above are funded under the Low Carbon Transit Operations Program, which gets money from cap-and-trade and is a rare potential source of funding for operations. Holden\u2019s bills were stymied by this question of money, although he argued that a statewide transit pass program would be an appropriate use of cap-and-trade funding.\n\nMeanwhile the city of Sacramento sees huge potential rewards from its investment. \u201cWe think that next year, once we see the results from the program launch, we will see a regional expansion,\u201d said Schenirer. \u201cMy goal is to make it countywide, which would make logistics simpler, and also settle some equity considerations.\u201d Under the current program parameters, students who live outside the city but go to school inside Sacramento are eligible for the passes, but their neighbors at nearby schools do not.\n\n\u201cBut what I learned pretty early,\u201d said Schenirer, \u201cis that if you only look at transit as a social service, you will fail. But if we can look at this as a way to enhance ridership, we can get young people started early and it will pay off in the long run.\u201d\n\nThe list below, of potential benefits from student transit pass programs, comes from a legislative analysis of A.B. 2222, one of Assemblymember Holden\u2019s first tries at a statewide program.\n\nStudent transit pass programs have been found to:", "title": "City of Sacramento Approves Free Transit Pass Program for All Students", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Sacramento']"}, {"id": 267, "city": "['Orlando']", "url": "https://www.orlandoweekly.com/Blogs/archives/2019/06/03/city-of-orlando-officially-bans-single-use-plastics-and-polystyrene-on-city-property", "text": "click to enlarge Photo via Adobe Images\n\nSingle-use plastics and polystyrenes are now a thing of the past in Orlando's city-owned and operated spaces.The Orlando City Council unanimously signed off on a policy Monday that bans the use of items such as plastic straws, bags and utensils, and Styrofoam ice chests and cups, at city parks and venues including the Amway Center, Camping World Stadium and the Dr. Phillips Center for the Performing Arts.The policy \u2013 a part of the city's Community Sustainability Action Plan \u2013 is the first of its kind in Florida, the commissioners claim.

The group will work with community partners to examine the ways that the city government, as well as private employers, can ensure that survivors of domestic violence have the capacity to heal, find shelter, and remain safe without the threat of losing their income and employment.According to the Cleveland-based Domestic Violence and Child Advocacy Center (DV/CAC), domestic violence-related concerns result in the loss of eight million days of work in the United States each year. Worse, up to sixty percent of domestic violence victims lose their jobs because of the disruptive nature of domestic violence.Melissa Graves, the CEO at the DV/CAC, can easily recount several instances in which the workplace can become a barrier for a survivor\u2019s recovery. Individuals might miss work in order to seek medical attention, relocate to a new home or shelter, or to rearrange their financial situation. However, beyond these already significant burdens, Graves told Scene that survivors may need time off to ensure their child\u2019s safety and to access legal protections. They may even need to stay away from their job out of fear that the abuser will visit that location.Yet, the federal government does not provide protections to ensure that domestic violence survivors can retain their jobs while taking the time they need to recover. Instead, states and individual cities must endeavor to create and implement policies that help protect these individuals and their loved ones.For Zone, this effort is deeply rooted in his prior experiences. As a personal bailiff in the domestic relations court, Zone assisted hundreds of survivors in their efforts to navigate the legal system. \u201cI saw how barriers to having safe protection often impeded the ability of the judiciary from ensuring that there was safe protection for all individuals,\u201d Zone told Scene.However, while Zone\u2019s history connected him to the issue decades ago, it was a grassroots group that provided the catalyst for this current effort. Several students at the Cleveland Marshall College of Law spent their summer researching local policy issues as a core component of a graduate course. A few students in the class decided to take on the issue of safe leave. After reviewing data that highlighted the need for greater employment protections for survivors of domestic violence, the students were dedicated to producing legislation to resolve this issue.In a conversation with Scene, Lucia Lopez-Hisijos, one of the students involved in the project, explained that she first learned about an unpaid safe leave policy and believed it was a valiant effort the city should take on. While it would secure employment for people who took time off, it did not resolve the income concerns of survivors.Then, she learned that Philadelphia, New York and the entire state of New Jersey had adopted paid leave policies. After drafting some potential legislation, the students and their professor, Joseph Mead, approached Zone for his support. The Monday night resolution was a direct outcome of this work.Mead, an assistant professor at both the law school as well as the Levin College of Urban Affairs, is excited about the progress and told Scene that the effort was student-led and student-driven. \u201cOver the summer, my students mixed passion, talent, and hard work to make a compelling case for safe leave policies,\u201d said Mead. \u201cWe are looking forward to continuing to work with City Council and our community partners to study safe leave policies and other policies to support survivors.\u201dStill, there is significant work to be done to bring any policy to fruition. Zone hopes that there will be movement on this effort by the end of the year and will look to community stakeholders, including those within the nonprofit and private sectors, to help develop this work.The resolution mentions other cities that have adopted policies to protect domestic violence survivors, such as Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Chicago, Minneapolis and St. Paul. The law students based their original suggestions on the Philadelphia legislation, which requires that all employers with ten or more employees must provide paid leave that can be used for safety concerns. Zone hopes to collaborate with large, local employers as well as the Council of Smaller Enterprises to build support for this effort.And yet, while a local policy would be a big win for the city, relying on individual cities to adopt policies would undoubtedly lead to an unequal distribution of access. Would the Beachwoods and Solons of the state be likely to adopt these practices? Perhaps not. In additional to local policies, a state level policy would likely provide additional, much needed protections.Safeguards like those that State Representative Janine Boyd (D-Cleveland Heights) has been advocating for since she arrived at the statehouse. Along with her efforts to promote a state-wide paid leave program, Boyd is working at the state-level to provide additional protections for survivors of domestic violence.

But a fresh set of data released Thursday by the U.S. Census Bureau provides a stark reminder that the recovery hasn\u2019t been for all.\n\nPoverty rates for both Cleveland and suburban Cuyahoga County remain worse than they were before the recession of 2007-09. This is especially true for child poverty.\n\nOverall, a third of Cleveland\u2019s residents live in poverty. Worse yet, poverty is the life for more than half the city\u2019s children.\n\nCountywide, about 216,000 people are in poverty - roughly 92,000 in the suburbs and 124,000 in the city.\n\nFor a single person, this means an income of less than $13,064. The poverty threshold for a single parent with two children is $20,231.\n\nA suburb-by-suburb breakdown is not possible, because the new estimates the Census Bureau released are only for places of at least 65,000 people. But a cleveland.com analysis of what was released found 1-in-9 suburban residents in the county are in poverty, including 1-in-7 children.\n\nThough there have been improvements in recent years (poverty rates topped out at 39.2% in the city and 11.1% in the suburbs in 2014), the latest estimates show poverty is still worse than in 2006, the year before the start of the recession.\n\nCleveland\u2019s overall poverty rate for 2018 is 33.1%, up from 27% in 2006. For children, it is 50.5%, up from 41.9%.\n\nIn suburban Cuyahoga County, the overall rate of 10.9% in 2018 is up from 9.3% in 2006; suburban child poverty stands at 14.8%, up from 13% in 2006.\n\nThe poverty rate for the suburbs overall in Cuyahoga County is 10.8%, including 14.8% for children, according to new estimates for 2018 from the Census Bureau.\n\nNationally, among the places of at least 65,000, only four cities have higher poverty rates than Cleveland, the new estimates say.\n\nThey are Camden, New Jersey (40.9%); Flint, Michigan, (34.7%), and Detroit (33.4%), plus the college town of Bloomington, Indiana (33.8%). Rates in college towns can be higher because of student housing.\n\nOther data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics help explain the local economic trends. Though Cuyahoga County\u2019s unemployment rate is down from where it was at the start of the recession in December 2006, there are now 36,000 fewer jobs in the county since then, according to the BLS, and some employed people are working for less.\n\nOverall, Cuyahoga County\u2019s poverty rate is 17.7%, according to the new estimates, in comparison to 15.5% in Franklin County (Columbus area) and 15.4% in Hamilton County (Cincinnati area).\n\nSeven Ohio counties of at least 65,000 residents have higher poverty rates \u2013 Athens (32.3%), Scioto (22.9%) and Ross (20.6%) in southern Ohio, plus Jefferson (20%), Lucas (18.6%), Trumbull (18.5%) and Ashtabula (17.8%).\n\nThe lowest countywide poverty rates are just outside large, urban areas \u2013 Delaware near Columbus at 4.1%, Warren near Cincinnati at 5%, and Geauga and Medina near Cleveland at 5.1% and 6.8%, respectively.\n\nSummit County, which includes Akron, is at 11.7%. Other countywide poverty rates in Greater Cleveland are 14.6% for Lorain County, 11.2% for Portage and 6.9% for Lake.\n\nMedian household income ranges from $99,881 in Delaware County to $36,944 in Athens County.\n\nIn Greater Cleveland, median household income was reported at $82,784 for Geauga, $75,786 for Medina, $65,835 for Lake, $64,550 for Portage, $58,876 for Summit, $58,613 for Lorain, and $49,910 for Cuyahoga.\n\nRich Exner, data analysis editor for cleveland.com, writes about numbers on a variety of topics.

City employees and their families will then be invited to take the Seven-Day Rescue Challenge and eat a heart-healthy plant-based diet for one solid week, with a full menu of resources, recipes and online coaching.\n\n\"Heart attacks are the number one cause of in-the-line-of-duty deaths for firefighters and it ranks fifth for police officers,\" said Esselstyn. \"If our men and women on the front lines are at the highest risk for coronary disease, we want to equip them with the tools - and the delicious foods - needed to reduce their risk and help them be not only fit for duty, but fit for LIFE.\"\n\nParticipants will receive before-and-after biometric screenings to measure weight, blood pressure, cholesterol and fasting blood sugar. The challenge aims to demonstrate measurable improvement in as little as one week, with typical results including weight loss and cholesterol level and blood pressure improvements.\n\n\"We have abundant evidence that consuming a whole-food, plant-based diet is the best way to reduce and, in some cases, reverse symptoms of chronic disease, including obesity, hypertension, high blood sugar and elevated cholesterol,\" said ACLM President Dexter Shurney, MD, MBA, MPH, FACLM, DipABLM. \"This challenge is an excellent on-ramp for individuals to learn what's possible by changing their lifestyle and how their fork drives day-to-day wellbeing.\"\n\nAs part of the challenge, participants can attend the world premiere screening of \"The Game Changers\". Executive-produced by James Cameron, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jackie Chan, the film documents the explosive rise of plant-based eating in professional sports, mixing real-time, groundbreaking science with cinematic stories of struggle and triumph. The film features some of the strongest, fastest and toughest athletes on the planet, with additional EPs including Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton, top-ranked tennis player Novak Djokovic, and nine-time NBA All-Star Chris Paul.\n\n\"Our hope is that 'The Game Changers' will help the people of Pittsburgh put some dangerous myths about meat and protein to rest,\" said the film's producer James Wilks, \"while helping them understand that a plant-based diet is the healthiest and strongest way to eat.\"\n\nAfter the seven-day challenge, participants will be coached by the Engine 2 team for 10 weeks to help each person adapt the lifestyle to his or her needs, monitor results and track improvement. Three-month screenings also will be conducted to study the long-term effects of the campaign.\n\nFor more information about the Challenge visit www.HeartofaHeroPgh.com .

Move somewhere else, and you\u2019re unlikely to have a drastically different experience than you do here.\n\nBut if you\u2019re a Black Pittsburgh resident, your health, education and employment prospects trail those of just about any other comparable U.S. city, according to Pittsburgh\u2019s first report assessing inequality across both race and gender.\n\n\u201cWhat this means is that if Black residents got up today and left and moved to the majority of any other cities in the U.S., automatically by just moving their life expectancy would go up, their income would go up, their educational opportunities for their children would go up as well as their employment,\u201d said study co-author Junia Howell, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Pittsburgh.\n\nThe report, conducted by a team of Pitt researchers, was released Tuesday by Mayor Bill Peduto\u2019s office and the city\u2019s Gender Equity Commission.\n\nExamining data related to health, education, poverty and employment, the research team created a new tool \u2014 the Index of Ranked Livability \u2014 to assess how race and gender groups compare to one another in Pittsburgh and to those same groups in other cities. The team compared Pittsburgh to nearly 90 other U.S. cities with both substantial white and Black populations.\n\nFor example, the report found that Pittsburgh\u2019s rate of infant mortality for Black babies is more than six times higher than it is for white babies \u2014 13 deaths per 1,000 births compared to two deaths per 1,000 births. The report also found a significant wage gap among adults. Black and other non-white women earn between 54 and 59 cents for every dollar a white man in Pittsburgh makes.\n\n\u201c[T]he reality is that if we don't reckon with the inequality in Pittsburgh and that it's much greater than the vast majority of cities in the U.S., we are not only not making the city livable for our Black residents but all of us,\u201d Howell said.\n\nAt a press conference Tuesday afternoon, Peduto reflected on the city\u2019s maternal and infant mortality rates among Black women and babies and called for change.\n\nThe report found that maternal mortality among Black mothers in Pittsburgh was worse than a vast majority of comparable cities.\n\n\u201cWe have rates within our Black community that are Third World when it comes to infant mortality, and there shouldn't be anyone in the City of Pittsburgh that can accept that fact and not be asking, \u2018What am I doing?\u2019 or, \u2018What is my company doing?\u2019 and \u2018What is my organization doing?\u2019 in order to change it,\u201d Peduto said.\n\nWhen asked why health, education and employment outcomes were worse for Black residents, in particular Black women, compared to white people, Gender Equity Commission Executive Director anupama jain offered a simple explanation: \u201cSexism and racism.\u201d\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, many Americans and this includes Pittsburghers, have the mistaken belief that we do have a level playing field,\u201d jain said. \u201cUnfortunately, we have to build equity. When we assume it exists, we are doing a great disservice.\u201d\n\nShare tips, ideas & your personal stories related to Pittsburgh news.\n\n\n\nYour email:\n\nSend\n\nHere are some key findings from the report:\n\nPittsburgh has a high maternal mortality rate for Black women and a high rate of homicide for Black men. The study concluded that, \u201cBlack adult mortality rates are higher in Pittsburgh than in 98 percent of similar cities.\u201d\n\nPittsburgh has low college admission test scores and high rates of police referrals for all students, compared to other cities. The report notes that police referrals are \u201cdisproportionately affecting Pittsburgh's Black children and have a lasting impact on their educational attainment and economic well-being.\u201d\n\nBlack women and children are more likely to live in poverty in Pittsburgh than in comparable cities.\n\nThe report looked at \u201coccupational segregation,\u201d a phenomenon where one group is more likely to hold a certain type of job than another group. For example, a high concentration of Black men work maintenance jobs, while a high concentration of white men work in construction. Researchers found that Pittsburgh has high occupational segregation for Black men but low occupational segregation for white, Asian, Latinx and Native women.\n\nThe city\u2019s Black girls are less likely to drop out of high school or college once they begin, though fewer Black girls in Pittsburgh go on to college than Black girls in other cities. Pittsburgh also has a comparably high rate of graduate degrees among Black men and all Asian, Latinx and Native people.\n\nThe Gender Equity Commission was formed by City Council legislation in late 2016 and assembled in March 2018. Among the commission\u2019s primary charges was completing the gender equity study presented Tuesday. Beginning in November and continuing throughout 2020, the Pitt researchers and GEC will issue three more reports. The second report will examine inequities among city employees; the third, based on focus group research, will recount residents\u2019 \u201clived experiences with inequities\u201d; and the fourth will recommend specific policies the city and other institutions can implement to begin undoing the inequities.\n\nWhile a later report will offer specific policy recommendations, the report released Tuesday makes broad recommendations to start solving some of the inequities it highlights. For example, the report noted that Black women\u2019s high maternal mortality rates \u201care not the result of Black women's lack of access to prenatal health care\u201d and their unemployment and poverty \u201care not explained by their educational levels.\u201d\n\nRather, the report notes that Black women have poor outcomes because \u201cof the individual and structural racism and sexism they face.\u201d Regarding maternal mortality, the report says the high rate for Black women is caused by \u201chealth care providers' stereotypes of Black women that influence diagnoses and care\u201d and stress related to racism.\n\n\u201cPittsburgh should consider targeted interventions that address the racially discriminatory biases in the health care system, increase the number of Black health care providers, and reduce broader socioeconomic inequities faced by Pittsburgh's Black women,\u201d according to the report.\n\nOne of the study\u2019s authors, Dr. Liz Miller, a Pitt professor and director of adolescent and young adult medicine at UPMC Children\u2019s Hospital, noted that she was currently engaged in research and other work to lower Pittsburgh and Allegheny County\u2019s rates of infant and maternal mortality. She said she\u2019s currently engaged in a study that is seeking to find specific ways to prevent infant and maternal deaths.\n\n\"I feel like all of the players within our city and county are at the table really rolling up our [sleeves] and saying, 'Okay, all hands on deck,' these data are absolutely unacceptable,\" Miller said.\n\nThe report calls into question Pittsburgh\u2019s status as \u201ca most livable city.\u201d The city has earned the \u201cmost livable\u201d label from publications like Forbes magazine and The Economist and both Peduto and former Mayor Luke Ravenstahl have used the designation to promote the city.\n\n\u201cThe City of Pittsburgh has been called one of the most \u2018livable\u2019 cities in the United States,\u201d the report said. \u201cHowever, this title is based on rankings that do not consider whether Pittsburgh is \u2018livable\u2019 for all residents.\u201d\n\nPeduto, at the press conference, praised the researchers for providing the city with this data so that it can address the problems it highlights. He said he wants to create an \u201cequal playing field\u201d for all Pittsburgh residents.\n\n\u201cThere's a lot of poverty in the City of Pittsburgh, and we deal with the symptoms of the poverty, but we have a great opportunity if we take this data and are able to give people an opportunity for an equal playing field,\u201d Peduto said Tuesday. \u201cThat's all, just an equal playing field so every person has that potential in life.\u201d\n\nJ.

Read PublicSource's stories here.\n\nListen to this story\n\nThe City of Pittsburgh set a goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 50% by 2030. The objective is the centerpiece of the city\u2019s third climate action plan, passed in 2018.\n\nOver the past two years, Chief Resilience Officer Grant Ervin has been trying to show how the city can meet the mark. His plan focuses on increasing the energy efficiency of city buildings, procuring more green energy and building out an electric vehicle fleet.\n\nThe city now owns 19 electric vehicles and is preparing to turn its entire lot on Second Avenue into the city\u2019s first large-scale electric charging lot. If the city continues to implement his recommendations in its upcoming budget, he expects the municipality's emissions to fall by about 19% by the end of 2020.\n\nBut while the city is taking the lead, it hasn\u2019t yet kicked off one of its most important strategies: pressuring the biggest buildings in the city to stop using so much energy. And there isn\u2019t a plan yet for how to reduce the next biggest source of emissions: energy use in people\u2019s homes.\n\nSitting around a conference table with his four-member team, Ervin expressed optimism. \u201cIf we make the moves we have in concept now and the ones close to being in queue, the city\u2019s operations will hit its targets. I\u2019m pretty confident about that,\u201d he said. \u201cAre you, guys?\u201d\n\n\u201cNot with business as usual,\u201d responded Flore Marion, the city\u2019s energy advisor. \u201cBut with the plan we are laying.\u201d\n\nBecause climate change legislation has stalled nationally, many advocates believe the biggest hope for progress right now is at the local level, including in cities like Pittsburgh. Mayor Bill Peduto pledged as much during a public clash with President Donald Trump right before the city released its latest plan.\n\nThe plan\n\nMarion recently finished a report analyzing the energy use in all 154 of the City of Pittsburgh\u2019s buildings. So instead of just randomly picking which buildings to target, the city can focus on the least efficient ones first.\n\nMarion\u2019s report showed that Firehouses 22 and 34 are the least efficient: they use more energy per square foot than any other firehouse in the city. So if the city wants to get the most bang for its buck, focusing on those two buildings first will save the most energy and the most money in the long run.\n\nTo start, Marion expects to work on renovations of about 10 buildings per year. In the long run, this will save the city $1.3 million per year once the city has cut its energy use in half. There is no special climate change fund or separate accounting for costs associated with the efforts. But the city budgets a certain amount of money each year for building renovations, and the hope is to use that money to drive down its yearly energy costs.\n\nShare tips, ideas & your personal stories related to Pittsburgh news.\n\n\n\nYour email:\n\nSend\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking at what\u2019s the long-term benefit and implications, not just the quick and easy fix but how do we structurally fix the building to make it a higher-quality, higher-performance structure,\u201d Ervin said.\n\nThe city\u2019s buildings represent a fraction of the city\u2019s total energy use. Most of the change will have to come from the city\u2019s private businesses and institutions and, right now, it\u2019s not clear which ones to focus on.\n\nErvin has received two years of energy data from around 500 of the city\u2019s largest buildings, four of which are owned by the city, and Marion said she will finish analyzing the data by the end of the year.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to just release the data and have building owners feel discouraged about their performance,\u201d she said. \u201cThe goal is to support people and make them aware that once you realize your building is poor performing, there is a system out there to save money and energy.\u201d\n\nMany buildings have already formally joined together in a special 2030 District pledge to reduce their energy use by 50%. More than 500 buildings are committed to these reductions. Many of the member buildings in Oakland and Downtown have been committed for more than five years. The University of Pittsburgh, for example, has prioritized 25 buildings for energy retrofits between 2018 and 2020; lighting is being upgraded at the Petersen Events Center and there are planned changes to the Cathedral of Learning and the Chevron Science Center to name a few.\n\nLast year the university also agreed to purchase hydroelectric power from a new plant on the Allegheny River near the Highland Park bridge. The plant will supply the university with about 25% of its power starting in 2022. Not only will the university be using less energy, but the energy it does use will result in fewer greenhouse gases.\n\nThe city is preparing to follow suit, said Sarah Yeager, the city\u2019s energy planner. The city was already purchasing 35% of its power from green sources but most of the money it was spending on green energy went to companies in places like Texas and North Carolina. That played \u201cmore of an accounting function\u201d for renewable energy that is already built, Yeager said, and didn\u2019t incentivize companies to build more green energy capacity here. She said the city will be ready to buy local green power within a year.\n\nWhile Pittsburgh has some of the country\u2019s greenest buildings, in places like Phipps Conservatory and at Frick Park, some developers still haven\u2019t gotten the message, Ervin said.\n\n\u201cSo, when you have affordable housing developments, developments in Lawrenceville, just building a building, a box to put tenants in, but not thinking about the implications,\u201d he said, \u201cyou are building for yesterday rather than building for tomorrow.\u201d\n\nHousing\n\nOne of the biggest gaps in the city\u2019s current plan is how to address the city\u2019s aging housing stock, which accounts for more than a quarter of the city\u2019s total climate emissions. The city needs homeowners to do what the city is doing: get an energy audit of where energy is being wasted and then invest in efficiency upgrades.\n\nConservation Consultants, Inc., [CCI] a nonprofit that currently audits about 120 homes per year, launched a competition in August to see which Pittsburgh homes could reduce their energy consumption the most. There are cash prizes and an online tool to compare homes.\n\nBut to enter the contest, homeowners need to first spend $400 on an energy audit. Even Ervin said that is a tough ask, particularly because the audit could then recommend many thousands of dollars in upgrades.\n\nIn some other states, there are better incentives for homeowners to invest in more efficient energy, said Lucy de Barbaro, the manager of market services for CCI. \u201cAnd those can be substantial rebates, and people are moved to act. And we don\u2019t have it here,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are frustrated with not being able to mobilize larger populations.\u201d\n\nIndividuals have until the end of October to sign up for the CCI competition, but a few weeks after CCI announced the contest, only 11 of the more than 130,000 households in the city had signed up. That won\u2019t be enough to move the needle.\n\nThe city is supposed to have reduced its greenhouse gas emissions 20% by 2023, to be on pace. But the most recent data, from 2013, shows the city\u2019s total emissions (not only the municipal emissions) were up 10%.\n\nThe city\u2019s climate work is changing the way the city does business, Ervin said. But it won\u2019t be enough if more businesses and residents don\u2019t follow suit.\n\n\u201cThe challenge is to expand the scale and growth in these areas,\u201d Ervin said. \u201cWe all need to do more.\u201d\n\nOliver Morrison is PublicSource\u2019s environment and health reporter.

The report covering last year, the 2018 Equal Employment Opportunity Plan, was released June 3.\n\nThat report shows gaps remain when it comes to the percentage of women and people of color working city jobs compared to the city's demographic makeup. The reasons for those gaps are not discussed in the study.\n\nFor example, while Cincinnati is roughly 52 percent female, according to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2017 American Community Survey five-year estimates, about 31 percent of the city's municipal workforce is made up of women. The city itself is about 42 percent black, but the city's workforce is 32 percent black. And while roughly 3.6 percent of the city's population identifies as having Hispanic origins, only about .6 percent of the city's workers identify that way.\n\nThe demographics are somewhat different for the city's part-time employees. Fifty-five percent of part-timers with the city are black, the report shows.\n\nThe report also shows that disciplinary action brought against employees was disproportionate to the makeup of the workforce. Of the 278 disciplinary actions taken by the city in 2018, 64 percent went to black employees. Most of the employees disciplined \u2014 77 percent \u2014 were men.\n\nTwenty employees filed 22 state and federal equal opportunity complaints against the city last year. Fourteen of those complaints \u2014 equally split between black and white and male and female employees \u2014 were filed directly with the federal government. Another eight complaints \u2014 all from black and all but two from female employees \u2014 were filed with the Ohio Civil Rights Commission. Details about the nature of those complaints are not included in the report.\n\nThe report shows that promotions also don't line up with the makeup of the city's workforce, at least when it comes to men and women. Only about a quarter of the 410 promotions given by the city last year went to women. About 39 percent went to black employees, however \u2014 higher than their representation in the city's workforce.\n\nThe study, which is required by an ordinance passed by Cincinnati City Council, contains more detailed information about the demographic makeup of various city departments, as well as applications received by the city and hiring data from 2018.\n\nThe city received more than 26,000 applications for employment last year. Forty-nine percent of those who applied were white and 41 percent were black. Other applicants identified as Hispanic, Asian, Native American or two or more races. Forty-five percent of those who applied were women, while 54 percent were men.\n\nThe applicants who were hired, however, were reversed \u2014 49 percent of all new hires by the city last year were black, while 41 percent were white. Forty-eight percent of those hired from that applicant pool were women, while 51 percent were men. But full-time hiring still doesn't line up with the city's demographic makeup. Of the 211 full-time positions the city hired for last year, only 32 percent went to black applicants. Roughly 40 percent went to female applicants.\n\nThe report also has some interesting information about the generational makeup of Cincinnati's municipal workforce. So-called Gen-Xers make up the largest portion of the city's workforce at 42 percent. Baby Boomers make up the next largest share of the workforce \u2014 27 percent \u2014 followed by Millennials, who represent 26 percent of the city's workforce. So-called Gen-Z workers already make up about 3.8 percent of the city's employees \u2014 a large enough percentage to make the rest of us feel kind of old.\n\n\"Our mission is twofold,\" Cincinnati Human Resources Director Joe Wilson writes in the report. \"First, we want to ensure that the City of Cincinnati continues on the path of a more diverse and inclusive workforce. We can make strides through better recruiting efforts, and ensuring that everyone has equal opportunities as it relates to promotional and other job opportunities. Second, our mission is to also bring greater consistency in the things that we do as a City and as a Human Resources Department... We want to be sure that all of our employees know that they can bring workplace issues to our attention, free from retaliation, and they will be treated with the utmost seriousness and confidentiality as can be provided.\"\n\nYou can read the full report here.", "title": "How Does the City of Cincinnati's Workforce Match Up to the City's Demographic Makeup?", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Cincinnati']"}, {"id": 284, "city": "['Cincinnati']", "url": "https://www.citybeat.com/news/blog/21074025/cincinnati-city-council-passes-budget-boosting-human-services", "text": "Photo: Nick SwartsellCincinnati City Council today approved the city's $1.6 billion Fiscal Year 2020 budget, boosting spending for basic public services, some human services organizations and neighborhood groups.\n\nCouncil made several changes to Mayor John Cranley's proposed budget, including restoring funding to several outside organizations, creating a new funding category for legal aid organizations, restoring funding for the director of the city's Office of Environment and Sustainability and the city's bike program, and other additions.\n\nA veto-proof majority and, many times, all council members voted for the ordinances, adding $1.5 million for those groups on the budget's operating side. Some of that spending, including $750,000 for nonprofit Center for Closing the Health Gap, was opposed by Cranley and City Manager Patrick Duhaney.\n\nThe money for the additions and funding restorations comes from roughly $881,000 left over from this year's budget, plus adjustments to holiday pay for incoming police recruits (totaling about $220,000) and other sources.\n\nThe votes effectively close out the city's budget process, which also included a series of public hearings, ahead of the end of the fiscal year June 30.\n\n\"I don't think anyone is happy with everything, but I do think it's a good structurally acceptable budget,\" council member David Mann said today. Mann chairs council's Budget and Finance Committee.\n\nCouncil member Greg Landsman said the budget boosts several key priorities for the city, including basic public services, pedestrian safety, eviction prevention and other vital services.\n\n\"What this budget isn't is where we need to be long-term,\" Landsman said. \"I don't think anyone is comfortable with the amount of revenue coming into the city and the fact that we're under-investing in key infrastructure... we're under investing in our departments. I do believe that in the next year or so we're going to have to make some difficult decisions about transforming this budget, because we can't keep doing what we're doing, which is cutting and cutting and cutting.\"\n\nPart of the shortfall comes from long-running cuts to the state's Local Government Fund, which have cost the city tens of millions of dollars over the past decade. The Ohio Senate has suggested boosting somewhat the state's contributions to that fund, and the city expects to see roughly $2 million more from the state this year.\n\nOperating Budget\n\nGroups and offices receiving funds under council's budget changes:\n\n\u2022 The Center for Closing the Health Gap: $750,000\n\n\u2022 Office of Environment and Sustainability: $175,000\n\n\u2022 Economic Inclusion Wage Monitoring: $140,000\n\n\u2022 Office of Aging and Accessibility: $111,000\n\n\u2022 Bethany House: $100,000\n\n\u2022 Hillman Accelerator: $100,000\n\n\u2022 Chemical Addiction Treatment (CAT) House: $41,250 above the $46,250 in Cranley's proposal\n\n\u2022 Cincinnati Human Relations Commission: $20,000\n\n\u2022 Urban Agriculture Program: $20,000\n\n\u2022 City Clerk's Office funding restoration: $19,000\n\n\u2022 Invest in Neighborhoods: $12,500 above the $37,500 in Cranley's proposal\n\n\u2022 Neighborhood games: $10,000\n\nAs in past years, there was some debate about the way the city funds human services. The United Way's Human Services Advisory Committee oversees much of that funding, but other groups, including the Center for Closing the Health Gap, get money outside of that process. The city still vets those organizations, some council members say, but others, like council member Amy Murray, say the city should move all human services funding into United Way's wheelhouse.\n\nCouncil did move to create a new category for legal help under the United Way-administered funding process. That category would include Legal Aid Society of Greater Cincinnati and the Ohio Justice and Policy Center, both of which currently get funding from the city. Council added the Immigrant and Refugee Law Center to that category and provided $50,000 in funding for the nonprofit.\n\nCapital Budget\n\nCouncil also added $663,500 in spending on the budget's capital side funded by extra money from closed out projects and tax increment financing district proceeds.\n\nThat money would go to restore cuts in funding to:\n\n\u2022 City of Cincinnati bike program: $251,000\n\n\u2022 Neighborhood Business District Improvement Program: $112,500\n\n\u2022 Neighborhood Transportation Strategies: $111,000\n\n\u2022 Electric vehicles for city departments: $96,000\n\n\u2022 Over-the-Rhine Museum: $75,000\n\n\u2022 ArtWorks mural funding: $18,000\n\nAmong the biggest winners in council's budget changes is the Center for Closing the Health Gap. As it was last year, the group's funding was cut under the city manager's and the mayor's budgets. Council also restored its funding last year.\n\nThe nonprofit, which saw a large number of supporters turn out to advocate for restoration to funding during the city's budget hearings recently, works to bridge health disparities experienced by Cincinnati's black residents.\n\nThe nonprofit has been in the news recently after texts released by the city showed that former Cincinnati mayor and Health Gap founder Dwight Tillery was communicating with five Democratic Cincinnati City Council members about the ouster of City Manager Harry Black, FC Cincinnati's West End stadium, Health Gap funding and other city business.\n\nCranley has said that the Health Gap should go through the same process overseen by the United Way of Greater Cincinnati that other nonprofits apply to in order to get city funding.\n\n\n\n", "title": "Cincinnati City Council Passes Budget Boosting Human Services, Neighborhood Groups", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Cincinnati']"}, {"id": 285, "city": "['Cincinnati']", "url": "https://www.citybeat.com/arts-culture/culture/blog/21075879/cincinnati-ranks-no-7-best-city-in-america-for-recreation", "text": "Photo: Hailey BollingerWhen it comes to parks and recreation in the Queen City, we have more than enough options to keep us entertained and active.\n\nTo celebrate July being National Parks and Recreation month, personal finance website WalletHub evaluated data from a number of categories in order to calculate which cities have the best recreation.\n\nPhoto via WalletHubAccording to the website, \"One of the best ways to maintain an active lifestyle is to choose a city that encourages and facilitates recreation.

San Diego ranked No. 1 and coming in at the bottom of the list at No. 100 was Jersey City, New Jersey.\n\nAccording to Cincinnati Parks' website, our city parks span over 5,000 acres, with parks, nature centers, overlooks and more stretching from the riverfront to the suburbs.

The team purchased Revelation Missionary Baptist Church at 1556 John St. in May, and on July 3, applied for a demolition permit for the building. That application was approved this week.\n\nThe church congregation's leadership says it welcomes the move to a new church constructed by the team in North College Hill. But historic preservationists \u2014 and Cincinnati City Council member Chris Seelbach \u2014 have mounted an effort to save the German gothic-style, 154-year-old religious structure, an early home to reform Judaism in Cincinnati and the place where famed civil rights leader Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth once preached.\n\nSeelbach yesterday filed an application with the city's department of planning to get local historic landmark designation for the property. The Cincinnati Historic Conservation Board and City Planning Commission will consider that application and make recommendations before council gives final approval.\n\nBecause the demolition permit has already been granted, the designation alone wouldn't save the building \u2014 FC Cincinnati would have to miss the six-month window it has to use its permit and reapply for the historic designation to have an impact. Chances that the effort will be able to stop the demolition are slim. But Seelbach says it's still important to try and protect the building and recognize its significant place in Cincinnati history.\n\nAccording to the historic designation filing, Jewish congregation The Society of Brotherly Love constructed the John Street Temple in 1865 for $47,000 after having worshiped in two smaller locations in the Over-the-Rhine since 1848. The congregation is responsible for another local landmark \u2014 the Jewish cemetery on Ludlow Avenue in Clifton, which they established the same year they formed.\n\nIt took 27 years for the congregation to buy the leased land the building stood on from descendants of early Cincinnati leader David Wade, and 33 years to pay off the construction debt.\n\nToday, only the Lodge Street Synagogue on Ruth Lyons Way \u2014 constructed in 1861 \u2014 is older than the John Street Temple. Cincinnati's iconic Plum Street Temple downtown was built the year after John Street.\n\nThe Society of Brotherly Love counted among its members many influential Cincinnatians, and famed father of American Reform Judaism Isaac Wise preached there on a number of occasions. The synagogue followed Wise's lead and converted to Reform Judaism from its orthodox roots in 1871.\n\nBut by 1904, only about 40 congregants remained with the society, and they decided to sell the large John Street building. They eventually merged with another congregation and constructed a new temple together on Reading Road.\n\nA German Lutheran congregation purchased the building for $15,000 that year and held services in German for the large number of immigrants who had made the city's urban basin their home. The church underwent a $5.000 restoration a few years later which included the addition of new stained glass windows.\n\nBut demographic changes saw many of those Germans leave the West End over the next two decades, and in 1927, the church changed hands again. This time, an African-American congregation called the Revelation Baptist Church moved in. Revelation started in 1921 and worshiped out of nearby rented spaces before congregants Horrace and Melvina Sudduth bought the church for $27,000. Sudduth was a prominent member of the African-American community best known for owning and running the Manse Hotel in Walnut Hills. The next year, the Sudduths transferred the property to the church.\n\nThe church grew in importance in the black community, and, at the height of his Civil Rights work in the south, Rev. Shuttlesworth preached there from 1961 to 1966 before starting his own church in Avondale. In 1965, 5,000 civil rights activists marched from the church to the Hamilton County Court House to demand equal rights for African Americans.\n\nThe building received a significant addition in 1976, which covered part of the original facade with a concrete block structure.\n\nRevelation held onto the church until its sale to FC Cincinnati. The congregation there voted 49-5 to sell the building to the team and approached FC Cincinnati about the deal, according to church leadership. The church will continue to worship at the building until it moves to a new facility constructed by the team on West Galbraith Road. Some of the building's historic stained glass windows and other features will likely be moved to the new site.\n\n\"For some time, our church has been interested in opportunities to minister in a new church building located in a new neighborhood that could increase the worship experience of our congregation and promote the growth of our congregation,\" church Board Chair Walter Collier said in a statement. \"We are excited about the opportunity this presents to our church and look forward to increasing our membership at our new church building.\"\n\nThe team would like to demolish the building and other structures around it as it makes plans for development north of its coming stadium. But Seelbach and historic preservationists believe it should be saved.\n\nThe historic designation filing points out that few historic religious structures remain in the West End due to urban renewal demolitions that took place in the late 1950s and that the building is a prime example of early Germanic religious architecture in the city.\n\n\"1556 John Street\u2019s current congregation is a long-standing Black Baptist church which has called this building their home for nearly 100 years since 1928,\" the historic designation filing reads. \"The three congregations which have called this building home have marked it as a powerful reminder of Cincinnati\u2019s patterns of urban change.\"\n\n\n\n", "title": "Cincinnati City Council Member Files to Save Historic West End Church Marked for Wrecking Ball", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Cincinnati']"}, {"id": 287, "city": "['Cincinnati']", "url": "https://www.citybeat.com/news/blog/21067488/efforts-underway-to-craft-a-housing-strategy-for-cincinnati", "text": "Nick SwartsellCould Hamilton County\u2019s thousands of vacant lots and homes help solve the area\u2019s affordable housing shortage? That\u2019s one idea groups launching an effort to draw up an overall housing strategy for Greater Cincinnati are looking into.\n\nLocal Initiatives Support Corporation Greater Cincinnati, the Greater Cincinnati Foundation, Legal Aid, the Port and community engagement firm Cohear are compiling data and public input to design a series of recommendations that could guide policymakers as they seek to address the big gap in affordable housing in the county.\n\nCincinnati hasn't had an overall housing strategy since the 1980s, LISC Greater Cincinnati Executive Director Kathy Schwab says \u2014 something potential funders ask about when the subject of funding solutions to the region's housing problem comes up.\n\n\u201cFor people living in poverty, where they live and where they work are fundamental,\u201d GCF Vice President of Community Strategies Harold Brown told Cincinnati City Council\u2019s Budget and Finance Committee today. \u201cSo we embrace quality affordable housing as a real focus point in our work. We give lots of grants for folks who are doing great work in the housing space\u2026 but what we notice is that they\u2019re very disjointed. There is great work going on in isolated pockets. Everyone is asking what\u2019s the strategy, what\u2019s the overarching plan for improving this issue in our community? And frankly, there isn\u2019t one.\u201d\n\nHousing is affordable when residents living in it spend no more than one-third of their income on rent or mortgage and associated costs like utilities. Currently, Cincinnati needs roughly 30,000 more units affordable to low-and-moderate income residents. The county overall needs about 40,000 units, according to a study LISC completed in 2017.\n\nThe question is how best to address that problem. That\u2019s what the effort, funded by GCF, PNC Bank, the Mayerson Foundation and JP Morgan Chase, looks to do.\n\nOne answer might be funding rehabilitation of vacant properties to add more housing stock in the region. Schwab says that when the organization commissioned its 2017 study, it found that the county has thousands of vacant parcels \u2014 land or empty buildings that could be used for housing.\n\n\u201cSo we spent all of last year, with a grant from JP Morgan Chase and a bunch of data interns, inventorying about 10,000 parcels in the county,\u201d she told a Cincinnati City Council committee today. \u201cBy my simple math, if we have a huge housing gap, why can\u2019t we put families in these vacant homes? So we\u2019ve started the quest to find funding to do that.\u201d\n\nOther cities like Detroit, Charlotte and Nashville have drawn up an overall strategy for meeting affordable housing needs and used it to raise money to address the problem.\n\nDetroit raised $250 million for its housing strategy, Schwab said, pulling from city dollars and federal Community Development Block Grants, as well as contributions from banks and community foundations. The city is using the money for mixed-income development and rehabbing blighted properties into low-cost single-family homes.\n\nCincinnati\u2019s strategies might be different, Schwab says \u2014 something that will come to light as the work on a housing strategy continues.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about money,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s about policy. We have issues around eviction. We have issues around homeless camps. There are a lot of things that could be addressed around this plan.\u201d\n\nThe policies will be on Cincinnati City Council and city administration to piece together. Council member Tamaya Dennard says there are areas that may come into play there, including a reassessment of how the city hands out property tax abatements for development.\n\n\u201cThe onus is on us to create policies,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can fix the here and now, but if you don\u2019t have the policies, you\u2019ll be right back here.\u201d\n\nCouncil member Chris Seelbach said he hoped that the effort would reveal more about at what price points efforts are needed.\n\n\u201cLow-income housing is incredibly important,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have enough of it in the city. But I also don\u2019t think we have enough workforce housing \u2014 housing for people who are making $30,000 to $60,000. They can\u2019t afford $1,500 a month in rent, but maybe they can afford $600 or $700.\u201d\n\nSchwab says a lot of the details \u2014 what price level the city and county should focus on, how much money will be needed and other issues \u2014 will emerge as research continues.\n\nLISC hopes to have a housing strategy recommendation incorporating four to six focus areas ready by the end of the year. That\u2019s also when Cincinnati will need to present a consolidated plan \u2014 an assessment of housing and development needs \u2014 to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, which doles out key federal funding for housing and community development projects.\n\nThe effort should involve large amounts of public engagement, Schwab says.\n\n\u201cThis is not our plan,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is for the community.

That limit would be applied to Westport Road between Southwest Trafficway and Baltimore, and Pennsylvania between 40th Street and Mill Street.\n\nImage from Gould Evans\n\nThe three-story restriction also would apply to surrounding neighborhoods.\n\nBuildings up to six-stories would be allowed outside those areas, and property controlled by St. Luke\u2019s Hospital on the south edge of Westport along 43rd Street, now employee parking lots, could be developed up to 10 stories.\n\nDevelopment that respects the plan\u2019s height restrictions also is encouraged on the many parking lots within Westport\u2019s boundaries.\n\nAnother master plan recommendation concerns what it calls public spaces, which in the case of the tightly contained, 176-acre Westport community, primarily means sidewalks and streets.\n\nThe plan recommends that sidewalks be widened and vehicle traffic lanes be restricted throughout much of Westport. It also suggests a public square to be developed at the intersection of Westport Road and Mill Street.\n\nThe plan calls for sidewalks along Westport Road from Southwest Trafficway to Baltimore be widened to 15 feet where possible and travel lanes remain at 10 feet. It recommends improved pedestrian amenities including trees, benches and trash receptacles.\n\nFor Pennsyvlania, it recommends expanding sidewalks to 10 feet, maintaining the 9-foot travel lanes and improving pedestrian amenities including adding benches.\n\nWhere Broadway passes through Westport, the plan calls for Broadway to evolve toward more balanced, multiple modes of transportation including bicycles and advocates a minimum of 10-foot sidewalks and traffic lanes consistent with its boulevard status.\n\nThe plan also suggests the intersection of Broadway, 40th Terrace and Washington Street be reconstructed to narrow the street.\n\nThe plan for Mill Street calls for extending access to Dr. Jeremiah Cameron Park, a small green space northwest of 43rd Street and Broadway, by building a bicycle/pedestrian path from where the street dead ends near its intersection with Pennsylvania.\n\nMap by Gould Evans\n\nAs for historic preservation, which is a controversial subject particularly in Westport\u2019s commercial areas, the master plan took a more cautious approach.\n\nProperties within a formal historic preservation district have strict limits about altering their exterior appearance, a restriction that many business owners have resisted.\n\nThe proposed master plan documents Westport properties officially currently designated as historic and suggests additional properties and districts that could be eligible for historic designation.\n\nIt supports formal designation for any historic building or district, but recommends priority be given to creating historic districts for two residential neighborhoods, Whittier Place and South Roanoke.\n\nKevin Collison, a freelance contributor to KCUR 89.3, writes about downtown Kansas City for his website CityScene KC.", "title": "Westport's New Master Plan Calls For Shorter Buildings And Wider Sidewalks", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "['planning_&_design']", "annot_city": "['Kansas City']"}, {"id": 292, "city": "['Kansas City']", "url": "https://www.govtech.com/smart-cities/Kansas-City-Mo-Closes-Smart-City-RFP-Without-a-Selection.html", "text": "A far-reaching smart city initiative in Kansas City, Mo., is being fine-tuned as the city arrives at a better understanding of how to manage and deploy large-scale innovation projects.\n\nWithout striking a deal, the city has closed its RFP in a search for a private-sector partner to serve as a \u201cprogram manager\u201d for smart city projects.\n\n\u201cWe decided that first we need to create a \u2018smart city action plan\u2019 to help us make sure we know what kind of governance structure would best guide our smart city implementation in the future,\u201d said Chris Hernandez, director of communications for Kansas City. \u201cThis will create a more permanent way of incorporating smart city work into our daily operations.\u201d\n\nIn June of last year Kansas City issued an RFP as a first step in its efforts to locate a private-sector partner to design and build a \u201cfull integrated suite of sensors, networks and data and analytics platforms,\u201d according to the document.\n\n\u201cAll RFPs are, by their nature, a way to see what the market has to offer,\u201d Hernandez reflected in an email.\n\n\u201cWe discovered that there are a heck of a lot of great ideas out there for expanding smart city programming and technologies,\u201d he added.\n\nThe city has decided to move forward with its smart city planning \u201cwithout selecting a business partner from the proposals we received,\u201d said Hernandez.\n\nThe \u201caction plan\u201d Hernandez referenced is expected to be released this fall.\n\n\u201cOur most important goal is to implement smart and innovation solutions at all levels of our operations, and to push smart city thinking and technology deeper into our organization, our business practices and our delivery of basic services,\u201d said Hernandez.\n\nKansas City, with a population of nearly 492,000 within a metro region of about 2.2 million residents, stands as a smart city icon among medium-sized cities.

We can only realize these benefits if we implement the plan, so the hard work is just beginning.\u201d\n\nThe study assumes bike infrastructure will result in safety improvements on some of the Show Me State\u2019s most dangerous city streets. Those are expected to reduce injuries and fatalities 17 to 47 percent, in line with results from other road diet projects around the country. That would result, they say, in 15 fewer crash deaths annually. In addition, researchers estimate there would be 15 fewer deaths from inactivity and six fewer from air pollution.\n\nResearchers Michael Frisch and Joshua Boehm say bicycling can also offer substantial benefits to the local economy. People who bike frequently tend to own fewer cars \u2014 0.7 fewer per household on average, according to the National Household Travel Survey. That adds up to pretty substantial savings. According to government data, households with two cars spend 19 percent of their budget on transportation compared with 12 percent for one-car households. Some of that savings, the study assumes, would be reinvested in the local economy, instead of in cars and gasoline, which is mainly imported.\n\nOverall they estimate the effects would lead to about 12,600 jobs (job years) and $500 million in additional investment by 2050. The transportation savings, improved environment, reduce traffic injuries and increased local spending would generate about $400 in benefits per household.\n\nBike Walk Kansas City, which commissioned the study, hopes it will build support for the city\u2019s bike plan, which is undergoing hearings before City Council.", "title": "The Economic Value of Actually Following Through on a Bike Plan", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "['bicycle']", "annot_city": "['Kansas City']"}, {"id": 294, "city": "['Indianapolis']", "url": "https://www.theindychannel.com/news/working-for-you/northeast-side-residents-criticize-the-city-of-indianapolis-for-over-spending-on-new-project", "text": "INDIANAPOLIS \u2014 City councilor, Christine Scales, says the latest project in her district speaks to the city's \"skewed priorities\" when it comes to spending money on infrastructure, and ignoring more significant issues, like the potholes on the road.\n\n\"Let's spend the money where things are really needed, not where people don't want them,\" Larry Riggle, a resident, said.\n\nFor some neighbors, the condition of Johnson Road is more of a concern than building a new bike and walking path next to it.\n\n\"Obviously this is our natural drain so they're going to have to completely redo the drainage,\" Riggle said.\n\nRiggle says their sidewalks were also just updated and ADA accessible curbs installed a few years ago.

The annual gaming convention GenCon attracted more than 220,000 people last year and generated $75 million in direct spending.\n\nIndianapolis won the bid for the National Urban League conference due to strong support from the business community and local politicians, its quality hotels and facilities, and the local organization's ability to execute the convention, Morial said.\n\n'United Not Divided'\n\nMorial said the dual goals of equality and unity for the conference, which is themed \"Getting 2 Equal: United Not Divided,\" are significant given the upcoming census and presidential election.\n\n\"We have been dismayed by the efforts we've seen from the nation's top leadership to sabotage the constitutionally mandated method by which political power and resources are apportioned,\" he said in a written statement. \"'Getting 2 Equal: United Not Divided' serves as our declaration of commitment to a fair Census and a fair election and to achieving equity in education, jobs, health care and housing.\"\n\nLast month, a federal judge blocked the Trump administration's plan to add a citizenship question to the 2020 U.S. Census, USA Today reported. States, immigration and civil rights groups filed several lawsuits against the administration, accusing it of attempting to weaponize the survey against immigrant communities.\n\nChrystal Ratcliffe, president of the Greater Indianapolis NAACP, praised the Urban League's work locally and nationally.\n\nIncome equality\n\nHogsett said the organization can help cities like Indianapolis by guiding dialogue to building a more equitable future.\n\n\"Our city is experiencing growth and investment like few times in its history,\" Hogsett said. \"It's our priority to make sure that the good-paying jobs and the sustainable growth touches every neighborhood, touches every ZIP code, touches every resident of Indianapolis. Any economic success that fails to address inequality cannot rightly be called a success.\"\n\nIndianapolis doesn't rank among the best or worst states for income inequality, according to a Brookings Institute analysis of household income inequality in the 100 largest U.S. metro areas and their most populous central cities from 2014 to 2016. The analysis, which uses data from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey on median household income, found that only 5 percent of Indianapolis households earned more than $172,135 per year in 2016 while less than 20 percent of households earned less than $19,598 per year.\n\nFounded in New York City, the National Urban League provides economic and educational opportunities to underserved urban communities through programs, public policy initiatives and advocacy.\n\nThis year's conference also will include a one-day Small Business Matters Entrepreneurship Summit as well as a gathering called Tech Connect, which brings together innovators influencing racial justice and social change through emerging technology.\n\nSpeakers will include actress and choreographer Debbie Allen, retired Los Angeles Lakers player Norm Nixon and actress Vanessa Bell Calloway. All declared major-party presidential candidates also have been invited to address the conference.\n\nThe National Urban League Conference is one of several conferences expected to take place in Indianapolis this year and next. Leonard Hoops, Visit Indy president and CEO, said the National Rifle Association will meet in Indianapolis in April.\n\n\"That's an interesting juxtaposition with the NRA in April and the Urban League in July,\" Hoops said. \"There's a lot of people who will celebrate one or the other, but not both, because of political lines and all these other things, but Indy welcomes all.\"\n\nCall IndyStar business reporter Alexandria Burris at 317-444-6083 or email her at aburris@gannett.com.

So, it may come as little surprise to learn that just 4% of the city's garbage is recycled each year.\n\nWithout universal curbside recycling, residents in Indianapolis have to either go somewhere to drop off their recycling, or pay an $8-a-month subscription fee to have someone come and pick it up off their curb \u2014 a system that has frustrated residents, according to Allyson Mitchell, executive director of the Indiana Recycling Coalition.\n\n\"We take phone calls, and we get confusion, perplexion, and we do hear some anger from people,\" Mitchell says. \"Especially when they move from other parts of the country and they come to Indianapolis, they expect to see the same level of services that they had in other cities of our size, and when they come here and realize that they have to pay extra and take an extra effort to recycle, they're frustrated.\"\n\nOf Marion County's approximately 267,000 households, only 10% are enrolled in the subscription program, making up about 26,000 households, according to Katie Robinson, director of the city\u2019s office of sustainability.\n\nShe doesn't necessarily look at the city\u2019s low recycling rate as a black eye, but rather as an opportunity for Indianapolis to grow a program that fits its needs. Robinson says Indianapolis hopes to implement a citywide curbside recycling program by 2025 \u2014 and she sees an urgent need to do so.\n\n\"We actually just completed the city's greenhouse gas inventory and our emissions from waste is continuing to grow rather rapidly,\" she says. \"It was kind of striking to see that increase, and so, we are very concerned.\n\n\"We need to get some of that waste processed accordingly.\"\n\nRobinson says Indianapolis hopes to tackle its food waste problem as well, by eventually offering a subscription-based composting service to residents.

In order for that to actually happen, though, the many different jurisdictions in the region will need to cooperate, zoning and land use policies will need to change, and a major push will be needed to carve out space along each of the corridors for \u201chigh-capacity transit.\u201d\n\nThe five corridors examined in the study are:\n\nEast Main Street: SR 256 to Downtown Columbus\n\nNortheast: Polaris Parkway to Downtown Columbus\n\nNorthwest: US 33 at Post Rd./Frantz Rd. to Downtown Columbus\n\nSoutheast: Rickenbacker International Airport to Downtown Columbus\n\nWest Broad Street: Norton Rd. to Downtown Columbus\n\n\u201cThese are good representative samples, out of probably ten (corridors) we could have studied,\u201d explained Yaromir Steiner, the founder and CEO of Steiner + Associates and the co-chair of the Corridor Concepts initiative, along with City Council President Shannon Hardin. \u201cEven just those five could absorb 50 to 60 percent of our future growth \u2013 saving woods and forests and farms \u2013 and that would (also) increase the tax revenue by three times per acre.\u201d\n\nThe final report, which was officially unveiled today, goes into great detail about the financial, environmental, and general quality of life benefits of focusing growth along existing corridors.\n\nSteve Schoeny, the Development Director for the City of Columbus, said that it\u2019s important to realize that those financial benefits extend to ordinary people \u2013 when more workers can easily get to job centers without owning or relying on a car, that creates what amounts to a pay raise for thousands of people.\n\nTransportation options, traffic congestion, and access to jobs are also big issue for companies looking to locate or expand in the region.\n\n\u201cCompanies look at the Columbus region and they say \u2018what are the long term risks for us as an employer?'\u201d said Schoeny. \u201cBecause at the end of the day, our most important input to our process is our people\u2026 and if you never know what\u2019s going to happen on the road network, and the road network is the only thing we have to rely on, yeah, that\u2019s a long term risk that the companies are going to take into account.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo this is not just about looking to manage growth,\u201d he added, \u201cbut also dealing with what now is a real and present danger to our economic competitiveness.\u201d\n\nThe study does not assume that most people in the region will give up their cars and switch to riding the bus or walking everywhere. Under the \u201cfocused growth trajectory,\u201d the projected transit use for people who live within one of the corridors is eight percent (compared to one and a half percent under the \u201ccurrent trajectory\u201d model). But even that relatively small change in mode share would mean a significant reduction in vehicle miles travelled for the entire region.\n\nSimilarly, the density that is recommended for the corridors is not extreme \u2013 the corridors will not be developed with skyscrapers, but with a mix of mid-rise buildings, a variety of housing types, commercial businesses, and even industrial uses.\n\nOne big question that is not answer by the Corridor Concepts report, though, is exactly what form the recommended \u201chigh-capacity transit\u201d should take.\n\nThat\u2019s an issue that the Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA) will lead on, according to President and CEO Joanna Pinkerton.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s really important at this point is that we all acknowledge a fundamental shift to high capacity,\u201d she said, which means committing to providing physical space along each of the corridors that is dedicated to transit instead of single occupancy cars. \u201cWe cannot afford the current model, and it\u2019s unfair to place such a significant cost burden on the individual household.\u201d\n\nAlthough the report lists several different transit options as possibilities, it does not appear that light rail will be a top priority moving forward. Included on the corridors map is an abandoned rail line running roughly parallel to Cleveland Avenue \u2013 which could be used if it proves difficult to obtain right of way along the street \u2013 but Pinkerton seems to be squarely focused on Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), which she said will become an even more attractive option as the technology supporting it improves.\n\nThe development of COTA\u2019s CMAX line along Cleveland Avenue \u2014 the first BRT line implemented in Columbus \u2014 has led to an increase in ridership, she said, even without running in its own dedicated lane.\n\n\u201cWe have already invested in Bus Rapid Transit here, and we\u2019re seeing significant improvements\u2026 utilizing the existing road and our existing fleet, which was retrofitted to have connected vehicle technology,\u201d Pinkerton said. \u201cAnd we see communities that are investing in Bus Rapid Transit five and ten fold at the rate we are, and they\u2019re having great success.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe mode (of transit) itself will have to be determined based on the cost and technology, and (by) the revenue streams and incentives that are decided by the community,\u201d she added.\n\nCOTA has been working with the City of Columbus on a series of tactical urbanism projects, one of which is a temporary dedicated bus lane on West Broad Street. Several of those projects are now scheduled to be rolled out this summer and will serve as test cases, used both to gather data and to bring attention to transit solutions that could eventually be implemented on a larger scale.\n\nWilliam Murdock, Executive Director of the Mid Ohio Regional Planning Commission (MORPC), said that starting with something like BRT \u2013 rather than rail \u2013 would allow for more corridors to be developed at the same time, and for them to be built much more quickly.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an urgency to get in front of growth, and at the same itme, there\u2019s only so much federal resources and state resources, so\u2026 not only do we need to do it, we need to do it quickly, and that lends itself to what can we afford, what\u2019s efficient to do right now,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you look at something like\u2026 high capacity rail, those are expensive, really lengthy projects.\u201d\n\n\u201cSome of these corridors don\u2019t have the density to support transit right now,\u201d added Murdock. \u201cSo if we\u2019re getting the right of way and we\u2019re introducing, say, Bus Rapid Transit, and (the corridors) start to densify because we can move lots of people quickly, that might lend itself to other types of transit along the corridor as we go.\u201d\n\nThe entire Corridor Concepts report can be viewed here.\n\nAdditional Reading:\n\nShannon Hardin on Development, Transit & the Densification of Columbus\n\n\n\nInterview: COTA CEO Joanna Pinkerton\n\n\n\nInterview: Easton Developer Yaromir Steiner\n\n", "title": "Study Recommends Dense Development, Better Transit for Five Corridors", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Columbus']"}, {"id": 303, "city": "['Columbus']", "url": "https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/keeping-affordability-in-focus-as-columbus-revitalization-picks-up-steam", "text": "Columbus, the largest city in Ohio, is no exception to the affordability crisis that\u2019s sweeping the nation. The shortage of affordable housing is greatest at the lowest end of the income scale. In 2013, there were 57,000 \u201cextremely low-income\u201d renters competing for just 21,000 apartments available at rates they could afford, according to a 2017 report from the Affordable Housing Alliance of Central Ohio.\n\nRents are rising much faster than incomes, according to the report, and the segment of the population living in poverty is growing faster than the population as a whole. More than 28 percent of African-American residents in Columbus are considered severely cost-burdened, paying more than half of their income to rent, the report also notes.\n\nOn top of all that, more 10,000 housing units built in Columbus with federal subsidies have affordability requirements that expire in the next five years \u2014 just a slice of half a million more subsidized units facing that situation around the country, as Next City has reported.\n\nThe City of Columbus and Franklin County, Ohio, are now considering joining forces now to pilot a small community land trust in recognition of the need for permanently affordable for-sale housing for middle-income residents in changing neighborhoods. The Central Ohio Community Land Trust would launch with 30 or 40 homes, to be developed on vacant lots owned by the Columbus and Franklin County land banks.\n\nThe homes would be sold \u2014 or, really, leased \u2014 at prices that are affordable to households earning between $40,000 and $80,000 a year, according to a report in the The Columbus Dispatch.\n\nCommunity land trusts work by holding the deed to land permanently and long-term leasing the improvements to residents. On land trusts that focus on for-sale housing, when residents move out, they split the equity on the improvements with the land trust, which then leases the home to another income-qualified resident.\n\nThe Central Ohio Community Land Trust would be the first community land trust in Columbus, with homes in four neighborhoods. Mayor Andrew Ginther announced in his \u201cState of the City\u201d speech last month that he would commit $3.8 million to establish the trust.\n\nSteve Schoeny, director of development for the City of Columbus, says the land trust could be expanded in the future.\n\n\u201cWe think there\u2019s a lot that can be done with the concept of using a ground lease to preserve affordability, but we have to walk before we can run, much less fly, in terms of getting really creative with it,\u201d Schoeny says.\n\nThe city and county land banks have worked together closely since the county land bank was created in 2012. Together, they own about 1,800 properties, according to Hope Kingsborough, vice president of programs & housing for the Central Ohio Community Improvement Corporation, which administers the county land bank.\n\nIn the last five years, according to a recent study, the city and county land banks combined have demolished 1,600 blighted buildings, helped find new uses for 1,300 properties, and reduced the overall level of vacancy in the city by 18 percent.\n\nKingsborough says that her organization spent the last eight months studying community land trust models and making plans for a Columbus version. That includes attending a training session last year with the Grounded Solutions Network, a national network of community land trusts, local governments, nonprofit organizations and others who support or work in inclusive housing and development.\n\nThe Central Ohio Community Land Trust will launch with properties that the city and county land banks already own \u2014 in neighborhoods where values are rising.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s going to have a great impact,\u201d says Curtiss Williams, president and CEO of the Central Ohio Community Improvement Corporation. \u201cThese neighborhoods themselves are going through a revitalization period. What our project will bring to it is the ability for mixed-income folks to buy houses in these neighborhoods as they go through this revitalization.\u201d\n\nIn addition to $3.8 million for the Central Ohio Community Land Trust, which the city council is expected to vote on this week, the city is asking voters to approve a $1 billion bond package that includes $50 million for affordable-housing measures. Schoeny, the development director, says the city is working on a plan to prioritize that spending and is looking for consultants to help lead that process, which will involve the Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission and independent groups like the Affordable Housing Alliance of Central Ohio.\n\n\u201cWe think that there\u2019s great momentum around the affordable-housing issue, and we\u2019re gratified that it has the focus it has and that folks are thinking about how to address it,\u201d says Roberta Garber, executive director at the Affordable Housing Alliance of Central Ohio.\n\nGarber notes that in order to address the scale of the affordable-housing shortage in Columbus, the city would have to come up with an astronomical bond number to pay for not just new and preserved housing but direct rental assistance to those earning the least.\n\n\u201cIn the meantime,\u201d Garber says, \u201c$50 million is significant.\u201d\n\nHer group is looking forward to participating in the planning process.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re always going to be the ones who remind folks that the group that still has the greatest need in our community are those with the lower incomes,\u201d Garber says.", "title": "Keeping Affordability in Focus As Columbus Revitalization Picks up Steam", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "['poverty']", "annot_city": "['Columbus']"}, {"id": 304, "city": "['Columbus']", "url": "https://www.govtech.com/fs/news/Columbus-Ohio-Takes-Multi-Strategy-Approach-to-EV-Adoption.html", "text": "COLUMBUS, Ohio \u2014 The rapid rise in the number of electric vehicles humming down the streets of Columbus is not an accident. The growth has been part of a deliberate four-year effort to accelerate next-generation mobility, not only for this city, but also for others like it.\n\nOhio's capital region has set a goal of increasing EV adoption five-fold. In 2015, less than half of 1 percent of cars sold there qualified as EV. The aim now is to get that number to more than 2 percent by 2020, doing so through growing partnerships with the car dealership community, local electric providers, businesses and others.\n\nThis strategy, guided by Smart Columbus, has led to a 121 percent increase in EV registrations from the beginning of 2017 to end of 2018, according to Smart Columbus statistics. This compares favorably to the 82 percent growth of EV registrations throughout the Midwest during the same period. There are also plans to install some 900 EV chargers across the metro region.\n\n\u201cThe answer comes from multiple places,\u201d said Norman \u201cBud\u201d Braughton, Smart Columbus project manager for the city of Columbus, when asked how to describe some of the approaches the city has taken to increase EV adoption. \u201cIt\u2019s the work we\u2019ve done with the dealers. Because if the dealers didn\u2019t have the cars, the people wouldn\u2019t be able to buy them.\u201d\n\nOther stakeholders agree.\n\n\u201cThe success came through creating a market,\u201d said Zach McGuire, manager of Smart Mobility Adoption project at the Columbus Partnership, a business group leading the Smart Columbus project. \u201cAnd that isn\u2019t done through one silver bullet. It\u2019s a collective approach.\u201d\n\nSmart Columbus was born four years ago when the region was awarded a $50 million Smart City Challenge grant by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), which includes $10 million from the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation. The projects being pursued explore a list of technologies like connected vehicles, micro-mobility transportation and other approaches to address particular city needs around transportation.\n\nSmart Columbus also opened a facility known as the Experience Center as a central location for public engagement in the form of showcasing electric vehicles, as well as serving as a workplace for the dozens of software developers and others involved in the various Smart Columbus projects.\n\nWhen it comes to electric vehicles, the local government itself has transitioned some 200 of its fleet to EVs. And since electric cars require charging infrastructure, a large part of the project\u2019s focus was the buildout of public charging ports, particularly in places of employment. American Electric Power, (AEP) a large electric utility in the area, is investing $9 million into a charging infrastructure pilot, which will likely inspire other utilities to make similar investments, said Smart Columbus officials.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s rather pioneering in our state to have a regulated utility participate in charging infrastructure,\u201d said Jordan Davis, director of Smart Columbus at the Columbus Partnership, speaking with Government Technology this week.\n\nThe initiative also looked at large companies and the efforts they could take to encourage EV adoption within their workforces. The Columbus Partnership focused on its 75 biggest members, all of which are large employers in the region. The Partnership worked from that membership base to create a program to encourage EV adoption as well as alternative transportation.\n\n\u201cA great example is a company like Chase,\u201d said Davis, noting that the banking behemoth has some 22,000 workers in the region, with half of those at one location. \u201cThey had no charging infrastructure whatsoever.\u201d\n\nChase is now in the process of installing chargers at all of its campuses in the region, as well as installing rooftop solar generation. And that's just one business. Smart Columbus also began working with car dealerships to ensure staff was well-versed on the ins and outs of electric cars, and that they were well-supplied with EV models.\n\nThere have also been many ride-and-drive events held at workplaces, festivals, community events and any other location with a captive public audience where Smart Columbus brought EVs for test drives.\n\n\u201cEveryone has dealers. That\u2019s how cars are sold,\u201d said McGuire, commenting on how other cities can copy Columbus\u2019 EV strategy. \u201cAnd when people are behind the wheel of a car, they\u2019re more likely to buy the car. And people need to be educated on the technology.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s three things, I think it\u2019s education, butts in seats and engaging in sales experience.\"", "title": "Columbus, Ohio, Takes Multi-Strategy Approach to EV Adoption", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Columbus']"}, {"id": 305, "city": "['Virginia Beach']", "url": "https://wtop.com/virginia/2019/07/virginia-beach-pays-500k-to-clean-mass-shooting-site/", "text": "The city of Virginia Beach agreed to a $500,000 contract to clean a city building after a workplace mass shooting in May left 13 people dead, including the gunman.\n\nVIRGINIA BEACH, Va.

Another $6.6 billion is attributed to forest contribution to air and water quality.\n\nNow, the city of Virginia Beach is looking at the value of the city's forests as one solution to their flooding problems caused by climate change and the region's sinking lands.\n\nPamela D'Angelo reports\n\nIronically, rain precluded a group of conservationists, scientists and Virginia Beach officials from meeting with reporters outside at one of the forests being studied in the Princess Anne District. Their biggest concern - southerly storms that not only create stormwater, but also a domino effect that pushes water from sounds to bays to tributaries and into low-lying neighborhoods.\n\nBarbara Henley is a farmer and city councilwoman, whose family tree goes back generations in the area. She says flooding in her lifetime has been getting worse with climate change. \"We're a part of the Albemarle Watershed, so we have wind tides instead of the lunar tides that the Chesapeake Bay watershed area has and when we get a prolonged southern wind we get all this water pushed up here and it can't get out until the winds shift to the north.\"\n\nThe city wants to consider solutions beyond stricter development regulation and expensive infrastructure flood controls like levees and tide gates. \"We're looking at all of this as part of our sea-level rise, recurrent flooding study,\" Henley said. \"One aspect that we discovered is that we've got a lot of neat forest land. I learned how to say evapotranspiration because they taught me this process that the trees take up a lot more water than they need and it goes into the air and it can be a component in our flooding strategies.\n\nVirginia Tech is being brought in to study Virginia Beach and to locate forests and lands that work the hardest to reduce the risk and severity of flooding. The goal is to produce a tool that will help city officials identify best locations for reforestation and conserve forests that already sop up water. \"We're also getting evapotranspiration for unforested land uses, so we can also compare the difference what an urban system is doing - which is not much in terms of evapotranspiration,\" said Daniel McLaughlin, the lead scientist with Virginia Tech.\n\nThat's why urban areas with lots of roads, buildings and parking lots are referred to as heat islands. Think of a hot summer day walking across an asphalt parking lot to get into a building. Those areas can't release all that heat by evaporating water like a green space with trees and bushes can. \"Just like you perspire to cool your body, you cover the landscape. Just like you put a jacket on to take a run, you can't perspire, you can't cool yourself off,\" McLaughlin explained.\n\nThe city has had clashes with residents over more controversial solutions such as pumping water away from neighborhoods back into tributaries. \"There is no silver bullet,\" Barbara Henley admitted. \"One thing is not going to do everything and this idea of using trees or looking at trees is just one aspect of it. It's all a part of getting these potential tools examined.\"\n\nLike many other places around the Chesapeake Bay, the city is also considering one of the most difficult solutions - migration and relocation.", "title": "How Forests Help Mitigate Flooding", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Virginia Beach']"}, {"id": 310, "city": "['Charlotte']", "url": "https://www.governing.com/topics/urban/gov-charlotte-affordable-housing-lc.html", "text": "Charlotte has a housing problem.\n\nThe largest city in North Carolina, home to a growing financial sector, is short 34,000 affordable housing units to meet demand, according to a city report released in late 2016.\n\nWith those challenges in mind, Charlotte has embarked on a comprehensive approach to create more affordable housing. Last fall, the city more than tripled the amount of money it asked residents to approve in bond funding for the city\u2019s housing trust fund.\n\nTypically, Charlotte has gone to residents every two years and asked for support in the form of $15 million in bond funding. But in 2018, Charlotte asked for and received voter approval for $50 million in bond funding.\n\nThe city will use some of its additional bond money to acquire property adjacent to transit and commercial centers, pair the housing trust fund dollars with federal Community Development Block Grant funds to create mixed-income housing, expand the development of rental housing through Low-Income Housing Tax Credits, and ensure that publicly funded developments set aside at least 20 percent of units for families earning less than 30 percent of the area\u2019s median income.\n\nSince the housing fund was created in 2001, the city has pumped more than $136 million into the construction of low-income housing through grants offered to developers to build the units. Across the city, more than 7,000 units have been built and rehabilitated since the fund was launched. More than 3,000 of those units are affordable to families earning less than 30 percent of the area\u2019s median household income, or $22,250 per year.\n\nThe Tipping Point\n\nTwo events in recent years added a sense of urgency to the city's housing crisis.\n\nThe first was the 2014 release of a national report that ranked Charlotte dead last among the nation\u2019s 50 largest cities in terms of economic mobility. According to the report, which was released jointly by Harvard University and the University of California, children who were born poor in Charlotte had less of a chance to escape their economic conditions than did children in cities such as Detroit, Milwaukee and New Orleans, where the poverty rates are more than twice as high.\n\nThen in 2016, Charlotte police officers shot and killed an African-American man named Keith Lamont Scott; video footage of the shooting sparked days of protests across the city.\n\nPamela Wideman, director of housing and neighborhood services for the city of Charlotte, says the shooting and the economic mobility report were a tipping point. Together, the two events prompted officials to look at how poor residents, especially poor black residents, could be better integrated into Charlotte's economic growth.\n\nThe city and its surrounding county formed the Charlotte-Mecklenburg County Opportunity Task Force. The work of the task force culminated with a report released last summer, which called for a new, more multipronged approach to increasing affordable housing.\n\nThe city has attracted more than 100,000 new households since 2000, notes the report, titled \"Housing Charlotte.\" That's led to a housing crunch, and the increase in housing costs has outpaced increases in wages.\n\n\"While significant progress has been made over the past decade to increase the supply of affordable housing in Charlotte, the reality is that housing is becoming less affordable,\" the report concluded.\n\n'Put a Face on Affordable Housing'\n\n\u201cWe never want to concentrate the affordable housing in one area,\u201d Wideman says. \u201cWhat we should always do is create mixed-income neighborhoods.\u201d\n\nThat's not always a welcome proposition. Cities can encounter pushback when they try to diversify the mix of housing options. That's why Charlotte has focused on humanizing the need for affordable housing.\n\n\"We are trying to serve people that come to work every day, our hospitality workers, our teachers, our firefighters, our police officers,\" Mayor Vi Lyles said last month in announcing a partnership between the city and Bank of America and other financial institutions to provide low-interest loans for approved people to rent or buy a home. \"We're growing, and what we are trying to grow are neighborhoods, good families, good housing -- whether you choose to rent or to buy,\" said Lyles.\n\nCity planning documents have also consistently focused on the need for housing options for teachers, firefighters and other lower-income residents.\n\n\u201cI think there will always be NIMBYism\" from residents who don't want affordable housing options in their neighborhood, says Wideman. \"One of the strategies is to put a face on affordable housing and change the way people talk about it. This is housing for the entry-level teacher or the entry-level public employee.\u201d", "title": "Affordable Housing Crisis Reaches a Tipping Point in Charlotte, N.C.", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "['housing', 'poverty']", "annot_city": "['Charlotte']"}, {"id": 311, "city": "['Charlotte']", "url": "https://www.csrwire.com/press_releases/41939-City-of-Charlotte-Recognized-as-Champion-of-Trees", "text": "LINCOLN, Neb., May 06 /CSRwire/ - The Arbor Day Foundation has announced today that the City of Charlotte has been awarded the Foundation\u2019s Champion of Trees Award. This award recognizes a government entity, community-based organization, or partnership among such groups that has demonstrated exemplary leadership to develop and implement new policies and practices for municipal tree planting and care, natural area stewardship or arboriculture. The award will be presented on May 13 at an award reception for the City of Charlotte at the Charlotte Mecklenburg Government Center.\n\nThe City of Charlotte, North Carolina, is being honored for its Tree Canopy Preservation Program (TCPP) which preserves natural areas in the city through voluntary purchases or easements, paid for by fees collected from developers. Since 2014, the city has protected 221 acres, an area three times larger than what would have been protected through traditional tree preservation codes, and acquisitions are targeted for environmental attributes rather than left to developer choice.\n\n\u201cOne of Charlotte\u2019s most notable features are the stately, old trees that make up the city\u2019s urban forest,\u201d said Dan Lambe, president, Arbor Day Foundation. \u201cCharlotte has one of the most expansive tree canopies in the country. We are proud to recognize the city\u2019s creative and thoughtful approach to finding a sustainable way to allow the city to grow and still maintain its beautiful canopy.\u201d\n\nCommunity trees remove pollutants from the air, improve water quality, reduce stormwater runoff and lower energy use \u2014 providing economic and environmental benefits citywide. In the U.S., urban trees provide more than $2.4 trillion in environmental services. Charlotte has one of the most expansive tree canopies in the country, with 47% canopy coverage. The city receives more than $335 million in environmental benefits and services every year from its trees. The city wants to reach 50% canopy coverage by 2050 as part of its master urban forest plan.\n\nSince 1972, the Arbor Day Foundation has recognized the inspiring and life-changing work of leading environmental stewards and tree planters through the annual Arbor Day Awards. Award winners from previous years include the late Nobel Peace Prize winner Wangari Maathai, Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley, the United States Forest Service and Procter & Gamble.\n\nThis award winner is one of six being honored for their outstanding contribution to tree planting, conservation and stewardship. The remainder of the 2019 Arbor Day Award winners will be presented with their award during their local Arbor Day celebrations. More information can be found at arborday.org/programs/awards.\n\nAbout the Arbor Day Foundation\n\nFounded in 1972, the Arbor Day Foundation has grown to become the largest nonprofit membership organization dedicated to planting trees, with more than one million members, supporters and valued partners. Since 1972, more than 300 million Arbor Day Foundation trees have been planted in neighborhoods, communities, cities and forests throughout the world. Our vision is to help others understand and use trees as a solution to many of the global issues we face today, including air quality, water quality, a changing climate, deforestation, poverty and hunger.\n\nAs one of the world's largest operating conservation foundations, the Arbor Day Foundation \u2014 through its members, partners and programs \u2014 educates and engages stakeholders and communities across the globe to involve themselves in its mission of planting, nurturing and celebrating trees.

As Chair of the Charlotte Unified Development Ordinance Advisory Committee (Advisory Committee), I was granted the opportunity to speak in support of the proposed TOD amendments at the public hearing in March 2019. After some revision, the Charlotte City Council approved the Text Amendment to the zoning ordinance provisions on TOD on April 15, 2019 and adopted new TOD regulations that reflect the considerable efforts of the Charlotte Department of Planning, Design & Development (Planning Department), the Advisory Committee, interested agency, industry and community stakeholders, and individual citizens who engaged in the process. The amended TOD ordinance and regulations became effective upon adoption, creating four new TOD districts designed to foster development of moderate to high-intensity, compact, mixed-use urban neighborhoods near transit stations. The new TOD districts are designated as TOD-UC Transit Urban Center, TOD-NC Transit Neighborhood Center, TOD-CC Transit Community Center, and TOD-TR Transit Transition.\n\nSo, what\u2019s next for TOD and the Advisory Committee?\n\nTranslation & Alignment Mapping\n\nWe previously talked about the 2-phase process of translation and alignment mapping that would follow adoption of the new TOD regulations. As the initial step to bring existing zoning in alignment with the new TOD regulations, property that was zoned TOD-M, TOD-R, and TOD-E was translated to the new TOD-CC district upon adoption of the new TOD regulations. Between April 15th and June 30th, these translated properties have the choice to develop or redevelop under the previous applicable regulations if a zoning site plan has been submitted and accepted for zoning review by the City. After June 30th, all development will be governed by the new TOD regulations, with the exception of conditionally zoned development.\n\nThe Planning Department currently is tackling the second phase called alignment mapping, which entails rezoning parcels along the Blue Line light rail corridor to align with newly adopted TOD districts and policies. During the Advisory Committee\u2019s most recent meeting on April 25, 2019, the Planning Department laid out additional details regarding the process, noting that more than 1900 parcels will be rezoned, excluding parcels inside the I-77/277 loop, Uptown Mixed-Use District (UMUD) zoning, and conditional or optional urban zoning districts. Given the magnitude of this rezoning endeavor, the Planning Department intends to invite the actual property owners who will be affected to four public information meetings in May and June. The Planning Department and Advisory Committee discussed the utility and logistical reality of expanding the audience for public discussion beyond property owners directly affected, leaving open the possibility for additional public input prior to the hearing on the zoning petition that ultimately is submitted. Interactive maps will be made available before these meetings that will show particular addresses and (re)zoning recommendations. The Planning Department anticipates submitting the rezoning petition in July 2019, with the City Council public hearing in September, Zoning Committee consideration in October, and a City Council decision also in October 2019.\n\nTree Ordinance Text Amendment and Sign Regulations\n\nAs the Advisory Committee continues to be invested in the implementation of the TOD revisions, it also has a hand in the development of revisions to the tree ordinance for urban sites and new sign regulations. The Advisory Committee was provided an update on the status of these projects at the April 25th meeting. The stakeholder group began work on a Tree Ordinance text amendment in March (get caught up here) and the Planning Department timeline anticipates a City Council decision in October 2019. New sign regulation development will kick off in June 2019, also with an anticipated October 2019 City Council decision. The Advisory Committee is scheduled to address the tree ordinance text amendment at its next two meetings in May and June, and the sign regulations during its June meetings.\n\nCDOT Streets Map\n\nPart of implementing the TOD revisions is creation of a Streets Map that supports TOD. The Charlotte DOT (CDOT) provided the Advisory Committee with an update on the Streets Map process, identifying several key characteristics of streets that support TOD. The goal is to plan streets that will support and facilitate: (1) Safety for all users; (2) Equitable mobility options/complete streets; (3) Highly livable neighborhoods; (4) Ongoing and rapid growth; (5) Economic development; (6) A useful, engaging and high-quality public realm; (7) Higher intensity, high walkability, and highly accessible development; and (8) Investment in transit (1st and last mile).\n\nThe Advisory Committee continues to dig in and we are excited about moving the needle as Charlotte transitions to a Unified Development Ordinance. Our next Advisory Committee meeting will be May 16, 2019, during which we will return to the format of gathering the entire committee together and meeting as one group.

With our explosive growth, planning is vital. Guest host Erik Spanberg examines what\u2019s next.\n\nHow should Uptown Charlotte grow? City and county officials are asking the public that question as they plot long term growth and development in a new vision plan for Center City. Charlotte is a city keen on plans and studies, and roughly every 10 years the city develops a new one for uptown.\n\nA lot has changed in a decade as the city continues to experience explosive growth. We\u2019ve seen the addition of the Charlotte Knights ballpark, Romare Bearden Park, and $1 billion worth of private development, including high-rise apartments and new businesses.\n\nThe area known as Center City has long outgrown the bounds of I-277 and now stretches into SouthEnd, out to JCSU in the Historic West End, the growing Camp North End, and neighborhoods in between.\n\nAs leaders kick off the planning process yet again, we look at what\u2019s next for Charlotte\u2019s downtown and discuss how to develop a unifying vision plan.\n\nGuests\n\nMichael Smith, President and CEO of Charlotte Center City Partners\n\nLarken Egleston, Charlotte City Council member, District 1 representative, which runs through part of uptown.\n\nEly Portillo, Assistant Director of Outreach & Strategic Partnerships, UNC Charlotte Urban Institute\n\nLorna Allen, senior Urban Designer for the City of Charlotte Planning, Design, & Development Department", "title": "Charlotte Talks: How Should Uptown Charlotte Grow?

Many were razed to make way for the future, but there is hope for historic preservation. Guest host Erik Spanberg sits down with experts to discuss why.\n\nFor a long time in Charlotte, old buildings have been demolished to make way for the new. That\u2019s not particular to our city, but it seems to be a key part of Charlotte\u2019s story.\n\nIt happens in neighborhoods and in Uptown where, in March, one of the last remaining buildings from the early 1900s was demolished to make way for new apartments. All hope is not lost, though, when it comes to preservation.\n\nWork is being done by groups like the Charlotte Mecklenburg Historic Landmarks Commission to save our buildings before it is too late.\n\nGuests:\n\nDan Morrill, consulting director, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Historic Landmarks Commission\n\nEly Portillo, assistant director of outreach, UNC Charlotte Urban Institute\n\nDavid Walters, architect, contributor, UNC Charlotte Urban Institute", "title": "Charlotte Talks: Preserving Charlotte's Historic Buildings", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Charlotte']"}, {"id": 316, "city": "['Milwaukee']", "url": "https://urbanmilwaukee.com/2019/04/01/city-hall-making-americas-cleanest-city/", "text": "City initiating campaign and steep fines for littering to help clean up Milwaukee.\n\nGet a daily rundown of the top stories on Urban Milwaukee\n\nAlderman Russell W. Stamper, II has a bold vision. He wants Milwaukee to become the cleanest city in the country.\n\n\u201cI realize this won\u2019t happen overnight, but if we work together we will be successful,\u201d said Stamper at a Monday morning press conference announcing the city\u2019s Big Clean MKE campaign.\n\nAfter ticking off all of the city departments involved, ranging from the Department of Public Works to the Milwaukee Police Department, Stamper noted the city can\u2019t get it done by itself. \u201cWe cannot do this without the other part of the team and that\u2019s the entire community,\u201d said the alderman.\n\nA citywide awareness campaign is one prong of the effort. \u201cThere is no excuse for littering in our community,\u201d said Stamper. To hammer home the message, an ordinance passed by the council in late February raised the littering fine from $50 to $500. The fine goes into effect Monday.\n\n\u201cLittle by little, I think we have got away from being mindful of what our city looks like,\u201d said Stamper\u2019s colleague Alderwoman Chantia Lewis. \u201cDon\u2019t be a litterbug. Keep Milwaukee clean. We all need to do our part.\u201d\n\nMunicipal Judge Derek Mosley said the municipal court will do what it can to support the effort. \u201cWe are hoping the $500 fine is a deterrent,\u201d said Mosley. Those convicted of littering will have the option of community service. Mosley said the court could issue up to 50 hours of community service per offense with the Department of Public Works.\n\nBut today the municipal court doesn\u2019t see many people in his court for littering offenses. The police department told Urban Milwaukee it only issued 51 citations for littering in 2018.\n\nThe rate of less than one ticketed offense per week is too high for Stamper. \u201cI hope it goes down,\u201d said the alderman. \u201cIf it goes up something is not working.\u201d His vision relies on creating a city that cleans up after itself. But judging by the area around the site of the press conference, a vacant lot at N. 9th St. and W. North Ave., the city is currently missing out on ticketing countless offenders.\n\nJoin the Clean Up Effort\n\nThe city and non-profit partner Keep Greater Milwaukee Beautiful (KGMB) have a number of events planned for the community to get involved.\n\nKGMB will host a community-wide cleanup kickoff on April 27th from 9 a.m. until 12 p.m. at Lincoln Park. The city is also planning to host the second annual citywide Big Clean MKE day on August 17th.\n\nCan\u2019t make any of the events? KGMB will distribute \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to clean up your neighborhood said the group\u2019s executive director Joe Wilson. That includes everything from garbage bags and gloves to a \u201cmobile tool shed\u201d for groups of 30 or more. Those interested can register on KGMB.org.\n\nFrom May 6th through June 24th, the city will also be offering expanded garbage pickup through Project Clean and Green. Bulk item pickup will be provided at no cost on predetermined dates.

That\u2019s an approximately two-mile long corridor with the riverwalk planned for each side.\n\nLike the Menomonee Valley\u2019s redevelopment before it, the proposed valley riverwalk will have few peers nationally and even locally. The riverwalk won\u2019t look much at all like what is seen Downtown; instead much of the planned riverwalk will consist of an asphalt trail, native grasses and strategically-sited tree groves.\n\nOwing to the area\u2019s predominantly industrial usage and history as a marsh, the riverwalk will function more as a trail along the river said Department of City Development planner Greg Patin.\n\n\u201cWe wanted a document that reflected the uniqueness of the Menomonee Valley, but that was also clear and easy to use,\u201d said Patin. The city, in partnership with non-profit Menomonee Valley Partners, issued an RFP in early 2018 to find a project consultant, ultimately hiring architecture firm HGA and engineering firm The Sigma Group.\n\nThe final document isn\u2019t a blueprint for the city to start demolishing properties in the way, but instead a guide for where and how new segments should be developed. The city, as is standard practice with the rest of the system, will pay 70 percent of the associated cost of building a new segment as properties along the river are improved.\n\nIn 2017 the city passed a 50-foot overlay zone along each side of the river that governs the design of properties that are substantially redeveloped or newly constructed, encouraging more interaction with the river. The overlay zone sets aside 25 feet for the riverwalk corridor itself.\n\nDesign standards for the district mandate that the new trail segments must be at least 14-feet wide, compatible with Americans with Disabilities Act standards and open 24 hours a day. The asphalt paving would be 10 feet wide, with a two-foot-wide shoulder of crushed gravel running parallel to the paved trail on each side. Where space isn\u2019t available on land, the riverwalk will have short segments over water.\n\nArboretum groves of at least 12 trees are envisioned every 300 to 600 feet, with concrete surfaces, lighting and benches. The change from concrete to asphalt is intended to warn cyclists of potential intersections and to better tolerate the root structure of the trees. Patin told the committee that connectivity into properties and the street grid is important to ensure the riverwalk is accessible.\n\nThe design standards also include landscaping designed to improve the environmental health of the river by reducing run-off through the use of permeable pavements, bioswales and native plantings.\n\nEven with council approval, some segments of the corridor aren\u2019t likely to see a riverwalk for generations, if ever. A gap will remain for the We Energies substation that is along the river across from the Valley Power Plant. In addition, there are a handful of parcels owned by Canadian Pacific Railway that aren\u2019t likely to see riverwalk segments.\n\nA small segment that complies with some of the standards already exists via the Hank Aaron State Trail extension that runs along the river near the city\u2019s Department of Public Works facility and Marquette University\u2018s Valley Fields complex.\n\nThe Menomonee Valley design standards are far from the only riverwalk changes underway. As part of the Komatsu development in the Harbor District, a southern extension of the riverwalk is also being developed along the inner harbor and Kinnickinnic River. The previously planned Downtown and Historic Third Ward riverwalk is nearly complete with Trestle Park opening last summer.\n\nThe Menomonee Valley design standards will be up for adoption before the full Common Council on Tuesday, February 5th.\n\nIf you think stories like this are important, become a member of Urban Milwaukee and help support real independent journalism.

The Democratic party is expected to play up its connection to Milwaukee\u2019s working class roots. It\u2019s a sentiment that was evident in Perez\u2019s comments following the announcement \u2014 and one that Wisconsin labor unions were eager to embrace. On Twitter following the announcement, The DNC pointed out that labor unions had built the \u201cstate-of-the-art\u201d Fiserv Forum, where the convention will be held.\n\n\u201cWe need to fight alongside our brothers and sisters in labor to build a brighter future together, and empower the diversity of our party and country,\u201d Perez said in a statement. \u201cThis choice is a statement of our values, and I\u2019m thrilled Milwaukee will host the 2020 Democratic National Convention,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe Democratic Party is the party of working people, and Milwaukee is a city of working people.\u201d\n\nIt will be the first time in more than a century that Democrats will be in a Midwest city other than Chicago to nominate their presidential candidate. The political spotlight will shine for a week on a metro area of about 1.6 million people. Once dubbed as \u201cThe Machine Shop of the World,\u201d the famously working-class city also is known for its long love affair with beer and as the birthplace of Harley-Davidson motorcycles. The event runs from July 13 to July 16, 2020. Republicans are planning to gather in Charlotte, the largest city in North Carolina, from Aug. 24 to Aug. 27, 2020.\n\nJohn Zapfel, political director for the Milwaukee-based International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 494, which contributed to the committee fund, said the convention could bring a lot of work for the union. Hotels, for instance, will undertake projects to prepare for the crowd of 50,000 that\u2019s expected to follow the convention to the city.\n\nIn addition to placing the city in a national spotlight, Zapfel said he also hopes that the convention\u2019s message will praise the importance of union labor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s in the Midwest and it has been neglected in the last election cycle,\u201d Zapfel said. \u201cWhen we\u2019re spoken to, people listen.\u201d\n\nMilwaukee taxpayers won\u2019t be on the hook for the convention\u2019s expenses, under a deal passed during a special meeting Monday. Just hours after the convention announcement, the Milwaukee Common Council unanimously approved a contract between the city, the DNC and the host committee listing the city\u2019s obligations in playing host for the event.\n\n\u201cIt was a wise decision by the Mayor to pursue other financial opportunities to host the convention without putting the taxpayers at risk,\u201d Ald. Michael Murphy said during the meeting.\n\nThe agreement also stipulates that the city will offer free rides during the event to convention-goers and the general public. The convention will place local officials under further pressure to find a way to extend Milwaukee\u2019s streetcar to the Fiserv Forum.\n\nCity officials are still in the early stages of extending Milwaukee\u2019s recently completed streetcar to the Fiserv Forum. A new line to the arena would run north from the streetcar\u2019s headquarters at North 5th Street and West Clybourn Avenue along Vel R. Philips Avenue to the arena.\n\nPreliminary engineering is still underway for an expansion to the arena and to the city\u2019s Bronzeville neighborhood, a spokesman with the city\u2019s Department of Public Works said Monday. The city has $20 million set aside that could be used to match other money to pay for a streetcar extension. In December, the city missed out on a federal grant that would have payed for half of the $40 million it would take to expand the line. DPW did not return a request for further comment by press time Monday.\n\nDan Bukiewicz, president of the Milwaukee Building and Construction Trades Council, said the convention will likely advance a number of building projects over the next year-and-a-half, especially in the city center. The streetcar\u2019s extension to the Fiserv Forum may also follow the completion of a lakefront loop, which would take riders to the Milwaukee Art Museum and other waterfront attractions. The long-awaited Coture high-rise would include a first-floor transit concourse for streetcar.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to (expand the streetcar),\u201d Bukiewicz said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see remodels go on hotels that have been on hold. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see if there\u2019s a fast track on development downtown. Organized labor can get anything done.\u201d\n\nBukiewicz also serves as mayor of Oak Creek, a southern suburb of Milwaukee that he expects to see a \u201chuge windfall\u201d from convention traffic.\n\nDemocrats are seeing plenty of significance in Milwaukee after the 2016 election was defined by Hillary Clinton\u2019s being beaten in almost every part of what her campaign aides had confidently called a \u201cBlue Wall\u201d in the upper Midwest and Great Lakes region. That band of states twice sided with President Barack Obama, but Clinton held only Minnesota, ceding Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania \u2014 64 of the necessary 270 electoral votes \u2014 as white working-class voters flocked to Trump. Afterward, Clinton took withering criticism for not once visiting Wisconsin as a general election candidate.\n\nSince then, Wisconsin voters have re-elected the Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin and ousted former Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, in favor of the Democrats Tony Evers and the state\u2019s first black lieutenant governor, Mandela Barnes.\n\nWisconsin Democrats noted those midterm election results as they lobbied Perez and DNC officials, and presidential candidates already are paying attention. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar came to Wisconsin in one of her first trips as a declared candidate.\n\n\u201cA lot people feel that we lost (in 2016) because this area had been ignored \u2014 whether it\u2019s from a political standpoint or whether it\u2019s from a governing standpoint,\u201d said Barnes, one of the members of the convention bid committee. Holding the convention in Milwaukee, Barnes added, says \u201cwe are ready to reinvest in the Midwest, that the Midwest matters again.\u201d\n\nDemocrats\u2019 would be well-served by playing up their alliance with labor unions, Bukiewicz, which have a rich yet rocky history in Wisconsin. The state has seen a number of policies that have chipped away at unions under Walker, beginning with Act 10, which eliminated collective bargaining and led to an unsuccessful attempt to recall Walker.\n\n\u201cWithout a doubt it\u2019s going to become an issue,\u201d Bukiewicz said. \u201cWisconsin was a battleground over labor rights just 8 or 10 years ago. (Unions) are still around. They are not going anywhere. They have always been here. That\u2019s going to be a centralized issue.\u201d", "title": "Choice of Milwaukee for 2020 DNC to bring flurry of work (UPDATE)", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Milwaukee']"}, {"id": 319, "city": "['Milwaukee']", "url": "https://eu.jsonline.com/story/news/special-reports/milwaukee-violence/2019/07/10/milwaukee-segregation-how-we-measure-and-define/1523075001/", "text": "How we measure segregation and what the numbers actually tell us\n\n\"Milwaukee is America's most segregated city.\"\n\nIt's a claim repeated over and over, but it is not entirely accurate.\n\nYes, the city of Milwaukee is very segregated and it is certainly among the most segregated.\n\nBut it's actually the Milwaukee metropolitan region \u2014 which includes Milwaukee County suburbs and surrounding counties \u2014 that typically tops the rankings of most segregated areas.\n\nThe city itself falls in the top 10.\n\nBut what do we mean when we say an area is the \"most segregated?\" How do experts measure segregation?\n\nThe segregation index\n\nSegregation is typically measured using a black-white dissimilarity index. That represents the percentage of blacks that would need to relocate to be fully integrated with whites.\n\nA value of 100 indicates complete segregation; a value of 0 equals complete integration.\n\nThe Milwaukee metropolitan area's segregation index is 79.8, according to the Brookings Institution.\n\nThe city of Milwaukee's segregation index is lower at 70.8, a Journal Sentinel analysis found.\n\nHow is integration defined\n\nFull integration would mean every neighborhood had the same racial breakdown as the city or metro area as a whole, not a blanket 50-50 ratio.\n\nFor example, if a city is 60% white, 30% black and 10% Hispanic or Latino, then integration means each neighborhood would be composed of residents of whom 60% identify as white, 30% black and 10% Hispanic or Latino.\n\nWhat does that mean in practical terms?\n\nThe Milwaukee metropolitan area's segregation index is 79.8, according to the Brookings Institution.\n\nThat means at least three in four black residents in the metro area would need to relocate in order to live in fully integrated neighborhoods with whites.\n\nWhat are the rankings for the city and metro area?\n\nWhere does the city of Milwaukee fall compared to other large cities when it comes to segregation?\n\nA Milwaukee Journal Sentinel analysis of census data found the following ranking for black-white segregation of the country's 50 largest cities:\n\nChicago New York City Miami Atlanta Philadelphia Boston Milwaukee Washington, D.C. Houston Cleveland\n\nMeanwhile, the Milwaukee metro area routinely tops black-white segregation rankings from the Brookings Institution. The 2018 analysis from Brookings produced the following ranking:\n\nMilwaukee New York City Chicago Detroit Cleveland Buffalo, New York St. Louis Cincinnati Philadelphia Los Angeles\n\nWhy is it important to account for a metro area, not just a city?\n\nSegregation is not restricted to city borders.\n\nSuburban developments frequently included racially restrictive housing covenants and aggressive zoning laws to prevent black homeowners or renters from moving to an area, often in direct response to school desegregation and open housing policies elsewhere.\n\nFor example, the first racial restriction in Wauwatosa was placed on the Washington Highlands Subdivision in 1919. The covenant stated:\n\n\"At no time shall the land included in Washington Highlands or any part thereof, or any building thereon be purchased, owned, leased or occupied by any person other than of white race. This prohibition is not intended to include domestic servants while employed by the owner or occupied by and (sic) land included in the tract.\"\n\nBy the 1940s, at least 16 of the 18 Milwaukee County suburbs were using racially restrictive covenants to exclude black families from residential areas, according to records from the Metropolitan Integration Research Center, a nonprofit active in the late 1970s that examined segregation.\n\nContact Ashley Luthern at ashley.luthern@jrn.com.

But first he will discuss the flags plan with Alds. Nik Kovac, Khalif Rainey and Mark Borkowski as part of an information committee created by Council President Ashanti Hamilton.\n\n\"You can't move forward with something that's supposed to be a symbol of unity until you have unity, so hopefully we have a process that achieves unity,\" Kovac said after the meeting.\n\nRELATED: Will the City of Milwaukee get a new flag?

He launched a website chronicling the movement and teamed up with Ken Hanson, the executive director of Greater Together, a nonprofit organization devoted to promoting racial and economic equality.\n\nHanson on Thursday defended the People's Flag process, which involved a citywide design contest, saying the search received extensive media coverage.\n\nSome aldermen have backed making the People's Flag the official flag.\n\n\"I think this is an opportunity for us to be in sync with what the people want,\" Rainey said.\n\nIf that flag is eventually approved by the full council and Mayor Tom Barrett, the People's Flag would replace the current flag that has flown for more than six decades.\n\nThe People's Flag, a design known as \"Sunrise Over the Lake\" by Robert Lenz, won the 2016 contest and has since become ubiquitous around the city \u2014 appearing on bicycles, beer cans and bottles, Koss headphones, cars and Milwaukee Brewers baseball caps.\n\nSupporters of the People's Flag gathered again at City Hall for Thursday's Steering and Rules Committee meeting, including a group of third-graders from Milwaukee College Prep.\n\nAlso on Thursday, city officials also debated changing how Milwaukee handles closing city offices due to weather.\n\nThe city currently requires employees to use vacation time or go unpaid when their offices close, under a policy that has been in place since 1989.

During today's Common Council meeting, Ald. Michael Murphy says this weekend's 14 overdoses are proof the pharmaceutical companies need to be held responsible.\n\n\"One individual had a prescription filled in July with 131 pills,\" Murphy said. \"When found, they only had one pill left.\"\n\nMurphy authored a resolution to hire outside legal counsel to investigate possible solutions including litigation to the opioid epidemic. The legal counsel will work in collaboration with the state during class action lawsuits.\n\n\"This was a legal product sold by Big Pharma as a non-addictive drug in many cases,\" Murphy said. \"When we know most people got hooked on a legal narcotic through false representation, they have some liability. I think it's only fair the city recovers some of that cost we're spending so much money on right now.\"\n\nAccording to the National Institute of Drug Abuse, the use of prescription opioids has dramatically increased in the last 50 plus years. In the 1960s, 80 percent of opioid abuse started with heroin. Over time, the rate of first-time heroin use dropped to under 30 percent by the 2000s.\n\nThe first-time opioid abuse in prescriptions skyrocketed.

But coming to New England and skipping this city is a major travel mistake.\n\nFirst things first: Providence is home to several incredible universities and colleges, most famously Brown University. Thanks to that, prices are affordable -- except sometimes during parents' weekend -- and the community close-knit.\n\nProvidence is the capital of Rhode Island and is often referred to by its airport code of PVD.

The spot is classic when it comes to design (it's in a former bank building) and styles (jelly doughnuts, fritters) but utterly modern when it comes to flavors and techniques. The brown butter-pecan and pistachio flavors are both musts, and there are lots of vegan and gluten-free options.\n\nRelated content 50 of the world's best desserts\n\nIf you want to linger for your morning meal, check out The Duck & Bunny, a \"snuggery\" (the cafe's word for place that is adorable and cozy) in the trendy Fox Point neighborhood.\n\nThere's an emphasis on cupcakes and other sweet treats, but during the day, it's a great option for settling in with a laptop or a good book. (Sad side note: there are no ducks. Or bunnies.)\n\nBesides sweets, The Duck & Bunny has an afternoon tea service and a cigar room.

The options can be a bit overwhelming, so keep an eye out for the upscale Enoteca Umberto's, classic red sauce at Angelo's and pizza at Caserta's.\n\nRelated content 15 of the world's happiest places\n\nFor dinner, try to get a table at Persimmon, the James Beard Award-nominated New American spot on the aptly named Hope Street.\n\nWhile the menu changes often based on seasons and availability, there's not a single bum note here. Persimmon has the best of New England's farms -- from sunchokes and onions to duck and Maine lamb -- but is still cozy enough that you can ask what a menu item is without feeling embarrassed.\n\nProvidence's best hotel is The Dean, and even if you're not staying there, you should make the trip simply to eat at North.\n\nThis too-cool-for-school spot doesn't have a phone number or take reservations, but if you can muscle your way in, the reward is Asian-inspired small plates such as sake-glazed bok choy, spicy \"dragon wings\" and oysters with nori mignonette.\n\nThe Mother Theresa (mezcal, beet, cassis, rose and 'edible stars') cocktail at Courtland Club.

The speakeasy-style bar has some of the most inventive cocktails in the country, with ingredients such as beet juice and basil foam somehow feeling accessible and delicious.\n\nIf your travels bring you through Providence regularly, consider investing in an annual membership -- besides having the option to leave a beloved bottle of booze in a locker so you never have to haul it over yourself, there are periodic tasting nights and the one-off dinners with a guest chef.\n\nRelated content CNN Travel's 19 places to visit in 2019\n\nOne note: if it's warm out in Rhode Island, you are contractually obligated to try a Del's, which is a New England brand of frozen slushy lemonade. The green and white striped stands pop up throughout the state once it's hot out, and some will sell peach or watermelon-flavored lemonades, too.\n\nTo truly feel like a local, you also can't leave without a stop at one of the outposts of Newport Creamery, which is famous for its Awful Awful milkshake with sprinkles inside it.\n\nEnoteca Umberto's, 256 Atwells Ave, Providence, RI 02903, +1 401 272-8466\n\nCaserta's , 121 Spruce St, Providence, RI 02903, +1 401 621-3618\n\nPersimmon , 99 Hope Street, Providence, RI 02906, +1 401 432-7422\n\nNorth , 122 Fountain St, Providence, RI 02903\n\nCourtland Club , 51 Courtland St, Providence, RI 02909, +1 401 227-9300\n\nNewport Creamery , 673 Smith St, Providence, RI 02908, +1 401 351-4677\n\nI came, I saw, I shopped\n\nOne of RISD's most famous graduates is David Byrne of the Talking Heads -- the band formed while the members were students there.

Along Westminster Street, there are several local boutiques, notably Craftland, which sells jewelry, home goods, stationery and more from local producers and designers, and light-filled Symposium Books, where you can stock up on new and vintage records and books.\n\nColorful Craftland is like a real-life Etsy shop devoted to Rhode Island makers. Courtesy Craftland\n\nProvidence is home to two breathtaking libraries, the Fleet Library at RISD and the nearby Providence Athenaeum, which is public.\n\nThe Fleet is in a stunning former bank building and is not only notable for its architecture but for its collection of rare art and architecture books, while the Athenaeum pays homage to writers with Rhode Island roots such as HP Lovecraft and Edgar Allan Poe.\n\nTo keep the theme of architecture and history going, head to the Rhode Island State House. This Neoclassical building was designed by the New York City firm of McKim, Mead & White, who are also known for the Boston Public Library and the Washington Square Arch in New York City.\n\nA plaque at the Athenaeum bears the names of famous horror fans, like Guillermo Del Toro, who chipped in to buy a plaque of Providence writer HP Lovecraft.

The total overbilling is estimated to be between $50,000 and $100,000.\n\n\u201cThe City is aware of the issue with the recent property tax bills and is making the proper adjustments. The impact is minimal to individual taxpayers,\u201d said Victor Morente in a statement to GoLocalProv.com.\n\n\u201cRefunds will not be issued but the remaining balances for accounts impacted will be credited and adjusted,\u201d added Morente. \u201cThe City is advising all who may need assistance with this matter to reach out directly to the Assessor\u2019s Office at 401-680-5229 or by emailing [email protected]\"\n\nIn June, at an unprecedented 8 a.m. press conference, the Providence City Council leadership had unveiled a new tax plan with just two-plus weeks in the fiscal year to drastically change the burden to the homeowners of the most expensive homes in the city.\n\nAfter a contentious back-and-forth between Elorza\u2019s office \u2014 which said the new budget was illegal \u2014 and City Council leadership, which said the changes were necessary to alleviate the drastic increase in home values in certain sections of the city in the latest revaluation which resulted in higher tax bills for lower-income residents, the council ultimately slashed millions off of Elorza\u2019s budget and instituted a 40% homestead exemption across the board.\n\nAccounting Issue Addressed\n\nProvidence resident Ginny Pires said that when she got her tax bill for her home valued at $379,200, she did the math when the homestead exemption was listed at $151,617 \u2014 or 39.983386%.\n\nPires said that recalculated for 40%, the homestead exemption should have been $151,680.\n\nAs a result \u2014 Pires, who has an elderly exemption of $511.14 \u2014 saw that what the city billed her $5,589.44 in taxes should have been $5,587.89.\n\n\u201cThe difference between what the city was allowing as an exemption was only $63 less than what a 40% exemption would be; less exemption, more tax. It wasn\u2019t the dollar difference that bothered me, but the principle that the bill stated the exemption was 40%. That\u2019s what motivated me to go to the Providence Tax Assessor\u2019s office to have my bill corrected, or at least get an explanation as to why there was a discrepancy,\u201d wrote Pires.\n\n\u201cI told the employee of the discrepancy, and was given a 40% exemption with the difference applied to my tax due as a credit in the 1st quarter. The employee was very courteous and responsive to my concern. I then told my neighbor about this experience. He later told me that he also did not receive the stated 40% homestead exemption. Perhaps there are others...who should check the math on your owner-occupied residential tax bill before you make the 1st quarterly payment,\u201d said Pires.\n\n\u201cThe employee told me that the reason for the discrepancy was a \u201ccomputer glitch\u201d so that the quarterly payment would come out even. I doubted that to be true, but didn\u2019t challenge her on it,\u201d said Pires. The difference on my bill was $1.55. You only need a nickel difference or less to be able to divide by 4, and either come out even, or pay a penny more in 1 or more quarterly payments.\u201d\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEnjoy this post?

The system promises to provide faster Internet service and offer expanded capacity for networks that assist driverless vehicles, wireless electricity meters, and other so-called \u201csmart devices.\u201d\n\nSimilar 5G network proposals are facing community opposition around the country over possible health effects. Opponents point to the close-range antennas and equipment boxes that increase human exposure to mid-range radio waves than existing cell networks.\n\nTo operate effectively, 5G systems need to be spaced about 200 feet apart. They are often affixed to utility poles and streetlights close to homes and schools.\n\nThe health effects of 5G are largely untested and unknown. There have been limited studies that show harm to mice and rats from exposure to older 2G and 3G radio waves. Some communities want to halt installations until 5G is proven safe or exposure standards are set.\n\nIn Danville, Calif., the Town Council blocked Verizon from receiving a 5G wireless permit after residents complained about health issues. Communities in Colorado, Maryland, Oregon, Texas, and Wyoming and in Europe are asking for moratoriums on 5G deployment.\n\nMassachusetts has several bills looking at the health risks associated with 5G wireless technology and other wireless equipment.\n\nIn February, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., criticized the Federal Communications Commission and the Food and Drug Administration for not studying the health effects of 5G technology.\n\n\u201cSo there really is no research ongoing,\u201d Blumenthal said during a committee hearing. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of flying blind here, as far as health and safety is concerned.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, 5G equipment is showing up along Rhode Island roads. But getting information on how they got there and plans about the technology\u2019s deployment in Rhode Island has been difficult. Verizon, the Rhode Island Department of Transportation, the governor\u2019s office, the city of Providence, and the University of Rhode Island have stonewalled questions on the issue. Gov. Gina Raimondo was a booster of a 5G rollout and promoted legislation that preempts cities and towns from regulating the installation of such systems.\n\nIn response to questions about health risks, the city said it\u2019s asking potential bidders to consider the health and wellness of Providence residents.\n\nDiscussion about the buildup of wireless devices is expected to take place during an April 9 workshop hosted by the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission and its Power Sector Transformation Group.", "title": "Providence Announces 5G Plans Amid Potential Health Risks \u2014 ecoRI News", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Providence']"}, {"id": 327, "city": "['Salt Lake City']", "url": "https://www.buildingsaltlake.com/salt-lake-city-single-room-occupancy-ordinance/", "text": "Salt Lake City planners are proposing a new ordinance they hope will lead to the creation of new micro-apartments with shared amenities that could help provide needed housing to people who can\u2019t afford longer-term rentals.\n\n\n\nSingle-room occupancy (SRO) apartments have been part of the homelessness conversation in Utah for years. The city lost about 50 SRO units when it bought and demolished the Regis and Cambridge hotels near 250 S. State St.\n\nAdvocates believe paving the way for more of the small units by allowing them in certain zones across the city could quickly add to the stock of low- and very-low income apartment units.\n\n\n\nThe city is looking to clarify the ordinance around single-room occupancy units (SROs), and expand the list of zone types where apartments could be developed and rented on a weekly or monthly basis. That change is targeted to generate housing for people who can\u2019t afford a month\u2019s rent.\n\n\n\nThe Salt Lake City Council is preparing to vote on the proposed ordinance at its May 7 meeting with public comment scheduled for April 23. Among the requirements developers and building owners would have to follow:\n\n\n\nApartments would need to be a minimum of 100 square feet for a single person or 120 square feet for two.\n\nUnits could have either a private bathroom or kitchen, but not both. They could also have neither amenity.\n\nSROs could house 1-2 tenants each on either a weekly or a monthly basis.\n\nDevelopments would require fewer parking spaces per unit than other similar developments.\n\nThe ordinance would require developments to have a manager present on site around the clock, and shared amenities would have to be monitored with security cameras.\n\n\n\n\u201cIf we have to put in our ordinance how you should manage this property, that\u2019s a lot for us to regulate,\u201d new councilwoman Ana Valdemoros, who represents downtown.\n\nThe Rio Grande Hotel on downtown\u2019s west side is the only existing SRO development in the city today, though the former Capitol Motel (now Capitol Homes) near 1700 South State St. has been managed in a similar fashion since last year.\n\nIn picking the zones shown in color on the map, the city said it was trying to drive SRO development toward areas that were more bike and pedestrian friendly and near transit. The dwellings would need half a parking space per unit, compared with two parking spaces Salt Lake City requires for multi-family developments with two bedrooms or more.\n\n\n\nSROs would largely be permitted west of 700 East, and even primarily west of State Street. District 6, which includes the East Bench and Yalecrest, would be devoid of any areas where SROs would be permitted under the proposed ordinance.\n\n\n\nThe city is looking to allow them largely where commercial, downtown and high-density uses already exist. It would not allow them in community business zones like 9th and 9th.\n\n\n\nThe placement serves as a reminder of when the City Council considered blocking accessory dwelling units from being built on the East Bench and in the Avenues before backing out and allowing them citywide.

But the large contingent of youth and the meeting\u2019s location in the Mountain West will carry the same gravitas of previous gatherings at U.N. headquarters in Manhattan.\n\nIndeed, the selection of Utah\u2019s capital and heavy involvement of youth in planning and participating in the 68th Annual United Nations Civil Society Conference makes a statement.\n\n\u201cIn visiting Salt Lake City I was struck by the rapid growth and innovation there, symbolized by the construction cranes dotting the beautiful mountain landscape, and by the sense of opportunity as young people flock to the region for its educational and job offerings. It is a great setting for a global conversation on inclusion and sustainability in cities and communities of all sizes,\u201d Alison Smale, United Nations under-secretary general for global communications, said in the statement.\n\nThe three-day conference marks the first time it has been held outside of New York when the United States has been host. Paris, Mexico City and Melbourne, Australia, are among cities that have hosted the conference in the past.\n\nThis year\u2019s event will focus on sustainable cities and communities. The topic is among the 17 sustainable development goals the U.N. General Assembly adopted in 2015. Others include ending hunger and poverty, reducing inequality, and promoting decent work and economic growth \u2014 all to be achieved by 2030.\n\n\u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals are a global framework for cooperation to tackle the great challenges of our day,\u201d said Maruxa Cardama, conference chairwoman and secretary general of the non-governmental organization Partnership on Sustainable Low Carbon Transport. \u201cCities are growing so quickly that it is imperative we build them thoughtfully and make extra efforts to ensure that no person or group is left behind.\u201d\n\nMore than half (55%) of the world\u2019s population lives in urban areas and that figure is expected to reach 68% by 2050, according to the U.N. The conference is intended to help government and nongovernment leaders find sustainable solutions to poverty, housing, hunger and health, clean water, energy, climate change, infrastructure, transportation, education, migration, violence and gender equality.\n\nMore than 90 percent of Utah\u2019s population lives along the densely populated Wasatch Front corridor, with Salt Lake City located near the midpoint of the more than 100-mile stretch of cities and towns connected by roads and transit systems.\n\nConference organizers were persuaded by Salt Lake City officials that the city\u2019s efforts to tackle many of the issues the conference will address make it an ideal location.\n\n\u201cWith everything we are doing to build a sustainable and resilient city, from investing in more equitable transit and housing to becoming a clean energy city \u2014 Salt Lake City is the perfect place to have these important conversations,\u201d Mayor Jackie Biskupski said.\n\nIt will be one of the largest international events the city has hosted since the 2002 Winter Olympics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fitting that the U.N. is holding this here in that Utah is recognized globally as a place with a robust free market economy and civil society,\u201d said Deseret News Opinion Editor Boyd Matheson. He will moderate a panel discussion on how faith groups and other nongovernmental entities can offer people upward mobility, or opportunities to improve their economic situation.\n\nYouth movement\n\nThe annual conference used to be heavily focused on the work of non-governmental organizations \u2014 nonprofit agencies engaged in humanitarian, educational, health, human rights and environmental endeavors.\n\nBut a U.N. reorganization and renaming of departments and sections resulted in changing the name to Civil Society Conference, which better describes the broader group of stakeholders involved, including young adults, said Annie Deng, co-chairwoman for the Outcomes Sub-committee and sub-task lead on the Youth Declaration for the conference.\n\nBiskupski said the city made an intentional effort to recruit youth in the planning and carrying out of the conference. In fact, a record 43 percent of the attendees will be 32 years old or younger, she said.\n\n\u201cWe want this younger group to be at the table and having their voices heard because they are living with these issues today.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe like 32 years because that is the average age\u201d of the world population, she said. \u201cWe want this younger group to be at the table and having their voices heard because they are living with these issues today.\u201d\n\nVlada Yeramenko, 23, is among the dozens of local college students who got involved in organizing events for the conference. A native of Ukraine who graduated in May from the University of Utah with a bachelor\u2019s degree in international relations, she said her academic interests and her personal experience as an immigrant inspired her to get involved.\n\nHer mother\u2019s marriage brought Yeramenko to the United States when she was 15. She spoke little English, but a welcoming community in Sante Fe, New Mexico, helped her assimilate, develop her skills as a violinist and eventually find her passion in international relations.\n\n\u201cThis is a conference for everyone to feel included, and then to work to find solutions to the problems that we\u2019re facing right now,\u201d she said.\n\nThe young adults are also injecting an element of fun with their work. Before attendees begin three days of speeches and absorbing information from about 200 workshops, youth planners put together events on Saturday where they will be planting trees, cleaning up a section of the Jordan River, relaxing to yoga and discussing the U.N.\u2019s sustainable development goals.\n\nThe conference will include youth-led workshops and unveil a Youth Climate Compact that was drafted with input submitted before the conference from young adults around the world, said Deng.\n\nThe lengthy document lists nearly two dozen action items \u2014 ranging from recycling and consumption awareness to divesting in fossil fuels businesses and converting to renewable energy sources \u2014 that youth pledge to do to \u201cunite in action against the climate crisis.\u201d\n\nSustainable cities\n\nBiskupski said the city\u2019s negotiated agreement with Rocky Mountain Power in 2016 to provide 100% renewable energy by 2032 was a factor that caught the attention of U.N. officials reaching out to Salt Lake.\n\n\u201cThat made news across the country because cities had not been able to get their energy providers to really move the needle on going to 100% renewable,\u201d she said.\n\nThe city\u2019s investment in affordable housing, transit development and infrastructure were other components to its proposal that won over the U.N. a year ago this month.\n\nAnother factor is the state\u2019s involvement in humanitarian work, said Baldomero Lago, chief international officer for Utah Valley University, who first suggested to U.N. officials that they reach out to Salt Lake, the Deseret News reported in March. He had access to U.N. officials through after his Utah Valley United Nations, a group of humanitarian relief groups, business and faith-based groups, gained U.N. accreditation.\n\n\u201cWe talk about sustainability, but it is the humanity that actually makes things happen to sustain the world that we live in,\u201d Lago said in November, when the city announced it was hosting the conference.\n\nAlso at that announcement was Ahmad Corbitt, a director in the public affairs Department of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who added that cities are sustained first and foremost by residents\u2019 willingness to give of themselves.\n\nThe church is offering that opportunity at the conference. Its U.N.-affiliated Latter-day Saint Charities is partnering with Feeding Children Everywhere, American Airlines, JustServe and conference participants to assemble 375,000 meals for needy children during the three-day event.\n\nLatter-day Saint Charities Director Sister Sharon Eubank will also sit on a conference panel in a Tuesday session titled Civil Society Monitoring. Bishop G\u00e9rald Cause\u00e9, presiding bishop of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, will offer brief remarks at the conference\u2019s closing plenary session on Wednesday.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version incorrectly stated that the United Nation\u2019s Civil Society Conference is the largest international event Salt Lake City has hosted since the 2002 Winter Olympics.

The building will include an Evo retail store, local retailer L9 Sports, a hotel, restaurants, an art gallery, creative workspace, skatepark, and additional recreation to be announced soon. The project has a targeted opening date of fall 2020.\n\nThe Evo retail store and All Together Skatepark will feature indoor/outdoor integration and will offer the same programs as other Evo locations, including demos, sales and service for ski, snowboard, skate, wake and mountain bikes, an art gallery, and a music and movie venue.\n\nOther details on the project include:\n\nEvo\u2019s partner on the project is Lake Union Partners, a Seattle-based private development firm that specializes in historic renovation.\n\nThe buildings, the oldest of which was built in 1926, will be designed by Lloyd Architects, a local Salt Lake firm known for spaces including Campos and Publik.\n\nEvo will sponsor the Salt Lake City SheJumps chapter\u2019s Wild Skills program, which provides culturally competent adventures and curriculum to traditionally underserved youth in the outdoors.\n\nEvo\u2019s content partner will be local adventure photographer Adam Clark.\n\nThe campus news comes on the heels of Evo\u2019s move into Canada with the acquisition of five stores in Whistler and Evo\u2019s headquarters move in the Fremont neighborhood of Seattle. Having started as a website in 2001, Evo also has flagship stores in Seattle, Portland and Denver.\n\nThe project is the vision of Bryce Phillips, Evo\u2019s founder and CEO, who has long championed community projects that embrace fashion, culture and sport.\n\nThe only other All Together Skatepark is beneath Evo\u2019s Seattle location and it regularly hosts lessons and skate camps. The Seattle complex also sports two restaurants to support Evo\u2019s aim of creating gathering places. Similar community and experiential elements have been brought to other stores, including a monthly art gallery and events.\n\nAnother venture to strengthen ties with local communities is Evo\u2019s La Familia program, whereby Evo partners with independent retailers in key markets to ship orders to their stores. La Familia retailers don\u2019t profit from the initial sale, but it drives traffic to their stores, often leads to ancillary sales and puts Evo\u2019s customers in touch with quality mechanics and technicians.\n\nHere, Phillips, a former professional skier, discusses his vision for the Campus SLC project, why Salt Lake City was chosen, and what the investment means for Evo.\n\nWhat inspired this project and what\u2019s the goal? From its founding, Evo has always strived to build community through a love of the outdoors, music, arts and culture. Campus SLC is directly born from that founding DNA. Our goal is to create a crossroads and hub for the Salt Lake City community. We have been inspired by many projects, but we are not aware of others putting together the pieces exactly like this. Our hope and plan is to set a global bar.\n\nWhy Salt Lake City? Salt Lake City offers an amazing juxtaposition of urban environment paired with outdoor recreation access. It was a natural next step for Evo, especially having experienced the amazing response to our Denver store, which we opened in 2016. We continued to be impressed by the enthusiasm among Salt Lake City residents, and we are excited to be able to share in that stoke. It\u2019s also great to have an opportunity to breathe new life into such a beautiful building and growing neighborhood.\n\nThere is also a strong community of passionate recreationalists, and we can\u2019t wait to create a \u201ccommunity center\u201d for those looking to connect around our shared love of outdoor and urban culture.\n\nHow does it all work? For example, who\u2019s funding and who\u2019s running the different parts of the project? We are: both Evo, the retail business, and as a joint venture partner in the real estate development project. We are working with a small group of aligned investors that share our vision and are inspired to have a positive impact on the community. Seeing the project through from vision to operation affords us the opportunity to be intentional with every detail.\n\nWhat are you most interested in seeing how the project all comes to life? The collective group has a history of doing projects like these, whether smaller versions or each of the standalone pieces. Here, we are bringing it all together, knowing that the collection will be an up-leveled customer experience. From a business perspective, we really look forward to measuring the incremental upside that the operating businesses realize as well as incrementality on the real estate. We know that we are heading toward a scenario where we outperform the sum of the parts but proving that out and measuring it so that we can apply moving forward is where it really gets fascinating.\n\nWith regards to \u201cwhat is our hope,\u201d we\u2019ll know that it\u2019s successful when we can see and feel that we are having a positive impact on the community. This project is meant to embrace all that come into contact. From a local art enthusiast to a kid learning to skateboard to a hard-core skier from California that flies in and stays with us at the hotel, we want this to be a positive, engaging place for all.\n\nIs this a transformative move for Evo? It\u2019s definitely a significant step for Evo, but it\u2019s also not a far reach from where we\u2019ve been. When you look at our family of past projects and where we come from, this just makes sense. Moreover, as mentioned above, it\u2019s really doubling down on our core, our DNA, our passion for delivering experiences where people connect and celebrate their love for outdoor culture.\n\nPhotos courtesy Evo", "title": "Why is Evo Creating A Community Hub In Salt Lake?", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Salt Lake City']"}, {"id": 331, "city": "['Salt Lake City']", "url": "https://freeskier.com/stories/evo-announces-large-scale-salt-lake-city-campus", "text": "All photography courtesy of evo\n\nevo\u2019s presence in mountain communities is growing at a rapid pace.

Now the veteran Nashville-based developer envisions a project of a different type \u2014 in essence, an \u201coutdoor room\u201d that would strike an eye-catching pose within the epicenter of the city\u2019s central business district.\n\nSpecifically, Giarratana is proposing a radical overhaul of Anne Dallas Dudley Boulevard and its sidewalks (see here and here courtesy of Google Street View), which connect Union and Church streets. If undertaken, Anne Dallas Dudley Park would offer a two-lane street for slow-moving vehicles and lots of green space for pedestrians via a concept known as a woonerf, which was originally implemented in The Netherlands.\n\nGiarratana told the Post he plans to submit the complete street proposal to Metro, regardless of whether the city issues a request for proposals related to Church Street Park, the tiny public green space upon which the developer and his company wanted to build the high-end residential skyscraper Paramount (read here).\n\nTo carry a price tag that is not being disclosed, Anne Dallas Dudley Park would be Giarratana\u2019s latest in a string of visionary projects for Church Street, including (listed chronologically): The Cumberland, the Bennie Dillon Lofts, Viridian and 505.\n\n\u201cWe have had many meetings and collective input of Church Street,\u201d Giarratana said regarding a process that began in the mid-1990s. \u201cEach successive project has been informed by the residents, office workers and business owners at that time.\u201d\n\nIn 2018, Giarratana LLC proposed a land swap with Metro involving the pocket park, which sits across Church Street from the main library. The tiny green space was the first pocket park created since Nashville's urban renaissance, which began in the late 1990s. As part of the deal, the development company would have transferred to Metro a parking lot located at 301 James Robertson Parkway so that the city could create a replacement pocket park.\n\nRelatedly, Giarratana LLC (which also includes key team members Jenny McClain, Phil Meadows and Ted Kromer) would have committed $2 million toward the conversion of the James Robertson lot into a replacement park and waived a development fee to assist Metro in developing city-owned land (at 505 Second Ave. N.) with a services center and apartment building for the homeless. The project would have cost about $25 million and featured 100 residential units.\n\nAfter pushback from those opposed to the plan, Mayor David Briley earlier this year said Metro planned to eventually seek request for proposals related to the park. The RFP effort is on hold due to the run-off election this September and its status is unclear.\n\nGiarratana told the Post this week he decided to go ahead and have various parties work on a vision for the street. Participants have been Nashville-based Barge Design Solutions (for design); Agora Partners, which has offices in Los Angeles and New York and devised the park\u2019s activation plan; and Fletcher Ridge, a Nashville-based company that created a video (see here).\n\n\u201cPeople can watch it privately and we can play in presentations,\u201d Giarratana said.\n\nGiarratana said he is flexible as to the various scenarios that could unfold, including via the possible RFP. For example, Metro could undertake the complete street project itself (Giarratana said he is open to offering the city the plans at cost). Or the effort could be a public-private partnership, with Giarratana LLC \u2014 were it to be awarded the RFP \u2014 overseeing, paying the full cost and completing in one year. Under that scenario, and via the RFP, the company would be likely to then have the pocket park site for the Paramount skyscraper.\n\n\n\nIf Anne Dallas Dudley Park materializes as Giarratana envisions, it would offer one acre of green space. In contrast, Church Street Park covers 0.27 acres, according to Metro records. As planned, the future Anne Dallas Dudley Park could be closed for events. The street itself would function much like the segment of Fifth Avenue South between Korean Veterans Boulevard and Demonbreun Street, which has no curbs and sees pedestrians and motorists interacting in a relatively safe and distinctive manner.\n\nThe park could offer, among others, movies, live music, free wi-fi, so-called technology smart benches, puppet shows, yoga and food carts (see a video here).\n\nBen Donksy, an Agora principal, said a key goal is having each of the street\u2019s four corners at Church and Union activated.\n\n\u201cTony is a real estate developer but he has a similar attitude that I\u2019m used to seeing in [citizen] advocacy and downtown [partnership] groups,\u201d Donsky said. \u201cMy focus is figuring out how to make the park an accommodating place.\"\n\n\n\nMary Vavra, a planner and landscape architect with Barge Design Solutions, said the shared street concept is new to Nashville but \u201ccommon\u201d in cities that tend to be very progressive.\n\n\u201cWe are excited to introduce the idea to Nashville and create an interesting twist with the use of lush planting and lawn areas for activities such as yoga and movie nights,\u201d Vavra said. \u201cI hope Nashvillians will support this opportunity to breathe new life into a tired streetscape.\u201d\n\nVavra said the design process was influenced by many of the symbols used in the suffrage movement (of which Anne Dallas Dudley was a key figure) and previous studies by the Nashville Civic Design Center.\n\nThe Barge team includes surveyors, engineers and landscape architects, including John Brown, with whom Vavra has collaborated on several projects for more than 20 years (including the one involving the First Art Museum in 2000).\n\n\u201cDuring our team research for Anne Dallas Dudley, we discovered that John\u2019s distant cousin, Elizabeth Avery Meriwether of Memphis, was one of the first women in Tennessee to push for women\u2019s suffrage, and she worked with Anne Dallas Dudley on the movement,\u201d Vavra said.\n\nDonsky said that during the initial phase of the effort, he was a \u201clittle skeptical\u201d the plan could be fully effective.\n\n\u201cAnd then I saw what Mary had done,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is very forward-thinking public space design.

Debt payments. Operating budgets.\n\nFrom protests on the steps of the Metro Courthouse to power broker lunches at Midtown Cafe, the state of the city finances is the conversation permeating every corner of Nashville.\n\nThe swirling conversation about city finance affects everyday life for Nashvillians \u2014everything from a proposal for an unprecedented increase in annual property taxes to the salaries for public school teachers and even how we pay to park hangs in the balance.\n\nHow did a city thriving by so many economic metrics reach a point where it must sell an old fire hall in Green Hills or privatize its downtown energy system to meet its budget?\n\nConstruction cranes color the Nashville skyline and Fortune 500 companies may be hurrying to open corporate headquarters here, but there\u2019s a growing chorus of residents, mayoral candidates and other stakeholders who argue that the city is in a precarious financial situation.\n\nThe head of the school board\u2019s budget committee called it a cruel paradox.\n\n\u201cAs you know, Nashville\u2019s economy is doing very well. In fact, doing so well that many employees cannot afford to stay here,\u201d school board member Anna Shepherd told the Metro Council in her pitch for the district's proposed $76.7 million budget increase.\n\nBut understand, she said, that the request doesn't come close to \"fully funding\" Nashville schools.\n\n\"We would not be so bold to bring that before you without being secure in the knowledge that the city was ready for that level of investment,\" Shepherd said.\n\nShe said funding the budget the school board approved would merely show a measure of respect for district employees and make modest investments in critical areas.\n\n\"It allows us to tread water all while looking forward to the day when our city resources match the need of our children,\" Shepherd said.\n\nHow did Nashville end up in this situation?\n\nTAXES AND THE CAMPAIGN: Where Nashville's top mayoral candidates stand on a proposed property tax increase\n\nDean: The economic development mayor\n\nStart with the decisions made a decade ago under former Mayor Karl Dean\u2019s administration.\n\nDean left office with a remarkably high favorability rating, credited by many in the business community for deftly navigating the 2008 Great Recession and the historic flood in May 2010 in a way that set Nashville up to become an international \"it city.\"\n\nSupporters say Nashville is in excellent financial position because of Dean. Property values are skyrocketing, and tourism-fueled sales tax collections continue to increase.\n\nIn the last year alone, Amazon and AllianceBernstein have joined the list of notable companies coming to Music City.\n\nDean ran for election in 2007 on the promise of not raising property taxes. The former public defender and city legal director kept that promise in his first term.\n\nWhen the recession hit, Dean and his team of advisers, led by Finance Director Rich Riebeling and Deputy Mayor Greg Hinote, had to cobble together a budget that, for the first time in the history of Metro government, featured declining overall revenues.\n\nTo meet its budget during those difficult years, Dean eliminated open positions, laid off some staff and refinanced debt. Those moves created breathing room.\n\nBeginning in January 2010, the city went on offense. Dean successfully pushed a financing plan for the $623 million Music City Center through the council, and in his second term, began aggressively offering incentives to recruit major companies to move here or to help existing corporations expand.\n\nAfter the flood did billions of dollars in damage, Dean\u2019s team did its part to stimulate the economy. Looking back, his advisers say those moves worked.\n\nDean raised property taxes once during his eight years in office, a modest 23-cent increase in 2012. By the time his tenure ended, Nashville was attracting major tourism investments with new hotels, restaurants and music venues.\n\nThe strategy of investing in tourism and corporate relocations, combined with maintaining a low tax rate, helped turn the Nashville economy from struggling to thriving.\n\nWhen Dean navigated his early budgets, a hypothetical 1-cent tax increase represented about $1.5 million in revenue for the city. In 2019, that same increase would bring in $3 million, according to an analysis by The Tennessean.\n\nAcross Davidson County, property values have shot up and up.\n\nMore big-ticket items like a new Nashville Sounds baseball stadium and a renovated downtown riverfront, including a new amphitheater, earned Dean the reputation as Nashville\u2019s economic development mayor.\n\nHis advisers say those decisions helped more than just downtown.\n\n\u201cAs the city came out of the recession, we saw new developments arising across the city as it invested in its largest project in history, the overwhelmingly successful Music City Center,\u201d Riebeling said.\n\n\u201cIt was that same belief in investing in yourself that provided many of the decisions to provide incentives to some of Nashville\u2019s leading employers such as HCA and Bridgestone that made significant new investments in our city.\"\n\nThe city\u2019s investment generated thousands of jobs and also spurred growth in other parts of the city, in areas like Madison and Antioch with the Ford Ice Center.\n\nDecisions coming home to roost\n\nBut now, the decisions made by Dean are coming home to roost.\n\nThe deferred debt payments, thanks to his refinancing decision, are now ballooning.\n\nAlthough overall tax revenues increased by an estimated $103 million over last year, the city doesn\u2019t have the full benefit of that growth because $44.1 million will go to the escalating debt payments, much of it from the refinancing.\n\nBecause the city has raised taxes just once in the last decade, Nashville\u2019s tax rate is among the lowest in Tennessee and in the nation compared with peer cities.\n\nNot everybody is looking back on the Dean era so favorably.\n\nEmily Evans, who served on the Metro Council during Dean\u2019s tenure in office, said it would have been fine for Dean to simply tighten his belt after the recession and flood, or for him to raise taxes in conjunction with property reappraisals and invest more in big-ticket projects.\n\n\u201cBut when you don\u2019t raise taxes and you spend more, that\u2019s when you have a problem,\u201d Evans said, adding that the decision to refinance debt was especially problematic. \u201cOur property taxes in absolute relative terms are not high.\n\n\u201cA little tweak of them probably could have saved us a lot of heartache,\" she said, highlighting how the debt payments have since skyrocketed to compensate for when they were low during the Dean years.\n\nWill Pinkson, a Metro school board member \u2014 who has announced his resignation \u2014 said that while Dean focused on \"monuments,\" he let other basic functions of government, largely schools, \"basically dying on the vine.\"\n\n\"I think what he did in his second term was just double down on bricks-and-mortar stuff and he forgot about everything else,\" said Pinkston, who served as district budget chair the past year until March when he unceremoniously resigned that post.\n\n\"It was all, 'Let's get an amphitheater. Let's get a ballpark. Let's get a sidewalk in the sky,' \" he said. \"I think it's great that they were done, and I think it adds value to the personality of the city, but at what expense and what cost? It's been considerable.\"\n\nBarry: The short-lived mayor\n\nDean\u2019s successor, former Mayor Megan Barry, also eschewed a property tax increase as property and sales tax revenues grew. Barry\u2019s administration focused on backing a public referendum to create dedicated funding for mass transit.\n\nSchools, Pinkston said, also went on the back burner under Barry's leadership, when she put all of her chips and political capital on transit.\n\n\"When you're mayor, you want to affect the things you can affect,\" he said. \"And, at the time, the school system was in a lot of turmoil, much like it is right now. And she decided to just say, 'Let's go all in on transit' ... she was going to deal with schools at some point in the future.\"\n\nThe decision, he said, created an environment in the city where there wasn't \"real discussion\" about revenue measures, until the city got past the \"big, financially overwhelming\" transit conversation.\n\n\"Strategically, I don't think it was a bad move,\" he said. \"Unfortunately, it didn't work out for anybody, including transit and her.\"\n\nBarry\u2019s time in office was cut short by an affair and the scandal that culminated in a conditional guilty plea to felony theft and her resignation. Nashville voters defeated the transit referendum, and the city did not raise property taxes during her term.\n\nNashville had its reappraisal in 2017 during Barry's tenure, but failed to capture the growth when Barry decided not to raise property taxes, a typical move by Metro.\n\nThe combination of the decisions made in the decade, Nashville getting its major lick as the so-called \"it city,\" and the cost of living skyrocketing created an environment hard to dig out of politically and fiscally.\n\nBriley: The replacement mayor\n\nFor the two previous years under Barry, revenue grew by $220 million, allowing the city to make major investments and avoid cuts. But in 2018, the overall growth flattened to $87.8 million, largely due to successful reappraisal appeals.\n\nNashville\u2019s property reassessment in 2017 triggered an appeals process that caught officials off-guard. A greater portion of people were successful in their appeals than in 2013.\n\nAt the Metro Board of Equalization 64 percent had their values changed, while in 2013 the figure was 55 percent. The vast majority of those were revised downward, after the property owners made their case.\n\nInstead of going on offense, Nashville Mayor David Briley has pushed ahead with a tighter budget.\n\nFaced with lower-than-expected revenue and dwindling reserves, just two months after falling into the city's top job, Briley unveiled a $2.23 billion operating budget for the 2018-19 fiscal year \u2014 less than 1% over the previous year.\n\nThe budget fell more than $40 million short of the school district\u2019s funding request and did not fulfill a cost-of-living salary increase promised to Metro employees.\n\nFinance Director Talia Lomax-O\u2019dneal called it a \u201creal tight budget year,\u201d with the administration\u2019s goal to \u201cbalance the needs of the city.\u201d\n\nBut Briley\u2019s administration also banked on generating $38 million in new revenue.\n\nTo fill the gap, Briley proposed selling three publicly owned properties. That didn\u2019t go so well. One property sold for less than the appraised value, and two didn't initially sell.\n\nThe move to make one-time sales to fill a budget hole has been met with resistance. The Metro Council unanimously passed an ordinance that takes effect in the new fiscal year prohibiting the sale of Metro land to cover operating expenses.\n\nBriley also hoped to make up $15 million this past year by outsourcing the management of the city\u2019s on-street parking \u2014 a decision met with even more overwhelming public disapproval. His opponents in the Aug. 1 mayoral election have tried to capitalize on that decision.\n\nBut unable to secure a deal in time, Metro filled the anticipated hole with money from the city's fund balance that closed higher than expected this year. Briley \"hit the pause\" button on the private parking deal, citing a need for a comprehensive discussion because of public confusion.\n\nIt's unclear how the Briley administration will replace the $34 million in upfront payments that was supposed to come from the parking deal.\n\nHow the budget impacts you\n\nOne of the most tangible ways the budget crunch affects Nashville residents is in the form of taxes. The Metro Council will have three property tax hikes to consider when it votes on a final budget Tuesday.\n\nAt-large council member Bob Mendes, for the second year in a row, is leading the charge for one proposal. Mendes and council member Anthony Davis are calling for a 52.5-cent property tax increase \u2014 about a 16.6% hike \u2014 to generate about $162.8 million in new revenue to help the city budget.\n\nIf the increase is approved, a property owner with a home appraised at $250,000 would pay about $328 more annually in taxes.\n\nCouncil member Tanaka Vercher \u2014 who serves as Metro's Budget and Finance Committee chair \u2014 is seeking a 14.9% tax hike to generate $146 million more for the city.\n\nFor a home valued at $250,000, the Vercher proposal would mean an increase of about $296 per year.\n\nCouncil member Steve Glover is proposing 3.5% property tax increase to generate about $34.34 million for the budget. Under his plan, it would cost about $69 more per year for homeowners of properties valued at $250,000\n\n\"The conventional wisdom in the courthouse is that the administration will propose a property tax increase next year \u2014 after the election,\" Mendes wrote in his blog. \"The administration\u2019s proposed budget squeezes employees on pay and citizens on services in the meantime. It deepens problems when it should be creating capacity. It worries about opposition when it should be inspiring change.\"\n\nPolitical challenges often keep local governments from raising the property tax, leaving the question of how to pay for rising costs looming large. It's especially difficult to find support during campaign seasons.\n\n\"We hear, 'Let's get past the election and then we'll do the right thing,' \" said Brad Rayson, president of SEIU Local 205, the labor union that represents Metro employees and school district support staff. \"People are elected to be leaders. Making tough decisions is part of being a leader and doing the right thing and helping people understand.\"\n\nThe current tax rate is $3.155 per $100 of assessed value in the Urban Services District, the lowest rate in the history of Metro government, coming under 1968's $5.30 rate.\n\nThe closest to Davidson County is Wilson County's rate of $3.51. The highest in the state is Shelby County with a rate of $7.77.\n\nSupporters of an increase argue that it would address the city's core revenue problem and fulfill commitments to Metro employees and deliver desperately needed funding for schools.\n\nThe average support staff employee in Metro Schools, Rayson said, earns about $24,000 a year \u2014 nowhere near enough to get by in Nashville.\n\nBut Briley remains opposed to a property tax increase, and his administration has been lobbying council members to vote against them at Tuesday's meeting.\n\nWith revenues up, and even more building permits being pulled, Briley said he doesn't want to further burden the taxpayers.\n\n\u201cThis is not the right time to raise property taxes,\u201d Briley said, adding that when the right time comes, he'll make a case to Nashville residents.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s good for the people who live here, that they can spend that money on what they choose to spend it on,\" he said. \"It\u2019s a good indicator that the city is not in a bad shape if we can lower the rate that far and essentially do what the city is doing.\"\n\nA Tennessean subscription gives you unlimited access to stories that make a difference in your life and the lives of those around you.

Nashville is able to attract companies with its vibrant entertainment industry, thriving restaurant scene, a progressive culture and a lower cost of living than larger, coastal cities \u2014 while it simultaneously enjoys the low-tax, pro-business reputation the state has developed.\n\n\"You get all the benefits of being in a pro-business, red state climate with respect to right-to-work status, low taxes, fiscal discipline,\" said New Jersey-based site selector John Boyd. Meanwhile, the \"Nashville brand (is) being an inclusive city, a progressive city, a city that is attractive to a millennial workforce, a city that is able to attract and retain the best talent from around the globe. ... It\u2019s really a winning formula.\"\n\nBut the blue city-red state dynamic is not without challenges. In addition to facing regular efforts to nullify or weaken new city laws from Republican state lawmakers, Nashville city and business leaders also risk feeling the brunt of state legislation seen by some as discriminating against LGBT individuals. Such bills could turn off progressives considering a Nashville move or drive away prospective business and revenue.\n\n\"You have this inclusive, welcoming city of Nashville trying to do all it can to attract and retain workers,\" Joe Woolley, CEO of the Nashville LGBT Chamber, said. \"The state really pushes back on that.\"\n\nA handful of bills proposed this year are on the radar of several companies moving to Nashville and those considering expansion or relocation to Tennessee, Woolley said. They see the bills as discriminatory and potentially harmful to recruiting talented workers to Tennessee.\n\nOne bill calls to recognize marriage only between a man and a woman. Another allows adoption agencies to avoid lawsuits if they refuse to place a child based on moral convictions, which could affect same-sex couples as well as others seeking to adopt a child. A third adds new language to a law about indecent exposure that originally referred to transgender individuals and restrooms, even though current law already covers all adults in public places.\n\nStay in the know: Sign up for our free business newsletter.\n\nWhile these bills don't necessarily present a \"doomsday scenario\" for company recruitment, they could make efforts more difficult, Boyd said.\n\n\"A lot of that could create unnecessary obstacles for your economic development professionals,\" Boyd said. \"People invested in the economic development success of Nashville would hope that these bills do not pass.\"\n\nTennessee has 'dodged the bullet' \u2014 so far\n\nNashville's cultural amenities and economic development focus have helped it attract companies in the tech and finance sector in recent years and draw numerous expansions from companies headquartered on the coasts, areas long associated with progressive politics. In the past five years, several California-based companies, including KeepTruckin, IQTalent Partners, Wonolo, Eargo, Lyft, Eventbrite and Postmates, have opened sizable Nashville offices.\n\nMost recently, New York-based AllianceBernstein chose Nashville for a new headquarters, London-based EY announced a new Nashville office, and Seattle-based Amazon committed to opening a new Nashville office that is expected to employ 5,000 workers.\n\n\"Especially in target sectors like technology, banking and finance, the corporate headquarters arena, that\u2019s an area our clients are focused on,\" Boyd said. \"They want to be in areas that are consistent with that theme of being inclusive and friendly to top talent around the globe.\"\n\nBoyd said Tennessee \"dodged the bullet\" when its proposed bathroom bill failed to gain traction or widespread media attention in 2016 and 2017. The bill would have required students in public schools to use the bathroom corresponding with the sex on their birth certificate. In 2016, North Carolina passed a similar bill that also restricted protections for LGBT individuals and saw significant economic losses reaching $3.76 billion over a 12-year period, according to an Associated Press analysis. The bill has since been partially repealed.\n\nBoyd said Raleigh is a North Carolina city that has been able to maintain its business appeal. It was named as a finalist for Amazon's second headquarters, but it also was overlooked for Apple's recent expansion. Boyd also compared Nashville's blue city scenario to Austin, located in very red Texas, which was chosen for a major Apple office in December.\n\n\"Texas has had its fair share of conservative social policies in recent years,\" Boyd said. \"That has not mitigated or slowed the growth we have seen.\"\n\nCosts to Tennessee\n\nIn 2016, the Tennessee legislature passed a counseling bill allowing therapists to deny clients based on \"sincerely held principles,\" a law deemed discriminatory to LGBT clients by the American Counseling Association. The state lost three bookings and $3.4 million in direct visitor spending as a result of the bill, according to the Nashville Convention & Visitors Corp. Eleven bookings decided to choose another city because of the counseling bill, costing the state more than $66 million.\n\nA Tennessee business coalition formed in 2016, called Tennessee Thrives, to counter discriminatory policies that could harm the economy or reputation of the state, including the bathroom bill, according to the group. More than 450 business organizations joined.\n\nThe Nashville Area Chamber of Commerce has taken a position against the \"Tennessee Natural Marriage Defense\" bill filed this year, describing it as unnecessary after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on this issue in 2015. The chamber also is opposed to any bathroom bills related to transgender individuals.\n\n\"Unnecessary, unneeded discriminatory legislation really just provides a distraction from the good things going on in Middle Tennessee,\" Lee Harrell, the chamber's state policy vice president, said. \"Anything that is going to hinder or distract from Middle Tennessee being a very welcoming and open state for business is troubling. It's not that we think businesses will look at these bills as the factor on whether or not to expand or relocate, but certainly as a factor. ... We encourage policymakers to think about the long-term effects and the importance of Tennessee being a welcome and open state.\"\n\nBusinesses scoping out Nashville are most concerned about finding the right workforce, though companies do consider legislation and culture related to inclusiveness, Nashville Area Chamber of Commerce CEO Ralph Schulz said. Companies have never walked away because of legislation, but the state has so far avoided passing legislation that damaged the \"open and friendly\" brand of Tennessee, he said.\n\n\"Businesses come here for a variety of reasons,\" Schulz said. \"They also want a workforce to follow them to these areas. To the degree that this form of legislation affects workforce, they are concerned.\"\n\nRep. John Ragan, a Republican from Oak Ridge who sponsored the indecent exposure bill and a second bill concerning adoption, has said he is not concerned about the business impact if the bills are passed and is more focused on protecting religious freedom. Rep. Tim Rudd, R-Murfreesboro, who is sponsoring the still-active adoption bill, did not respond to questions about the business implications of his bill.\n\n\u201cIt is important that we encourage and retain adoption agencies in Tennessee,\u201d Rudd said in an emailed statement. \u201cFreedom of religion is one of the founding principles of our nation, and House Bill 836 protects the rights of our faith-based child placement agencies, supporting their efforts as they work tirelessly to help more Tennessee children through the adoption process.\"\n\nWhile the Tennessee Thrives coalition garnered massive business support, few companies are willing to individually comment on specific legislation or Tennessee politics. AllianceBernstein recently joined with the Tennessee Equality Project and other groups to speak out against three bills proposed but declined to be interviewed further. Several other companies declined to comment at all on how the political environment in Tennessee affected their business recruitment or location plans.\n\nThe muted response is not surprising, Boyd said. Even when North Carolina dealt with legislation restricting protections for LGBT individuals, many of the conversations were behind the scenes or through joint statements.\n\n\"A company really has no benefit to really go out on a limb in any way that is not coordinated and part of an overall communications or branding strategy,\" Boyd said. \"Companies want to be as neutral as possible. They don\u2019t want to be in the business of making enemies on the right or the left. Companies need to hire Republicans and Democrats; they need to sell their goods and services to Republicans and Democrats.\"\n\nWhile city business leaders and recruiters said the issue of discrimination and relevant legislation comes up in recruiting conversations, the office of Tennessee Economic & Community Development Commissioner Bob Rolfe disagreed.\n\nJennifer McEachern, a spokeswoman for Rolfe, said in an emailed statement that Rolfe had not discussed proposed legislation with any companies and that those conversations typically are not part of relocation and expansion conversations. She declined to respond to whether AllianceBernstein had asked related questions.\n\n\"Those topics are typically not a part of the discussion during the recruitment process; however, we are more than willing to answer questions or address any concerns a company might have as it considers Tennessee for its next project,\" McEachern said.\n\nWoolley said that in addition to AllianceBernstein, Amazon and EY are among other companies that have been in touch with the LGBT chamber about state-level politics. Businesses often ask him whether the bills that concern them actually stand to be enacted.\n\n\"Should we be concerned? Is it just politics or is it something to be worried about passing?\" Woolley said. \"They always cite North Carolina.\"\n\nWhether these bills will become law is uncertain. Schulz said proposed bills that are perceived as discriminatory are not necessarily a problem, but those that become law can become one.\n\nThe defense of marriage bill has a fiscal note potentially exceeding $9 billion in a fiscal year related to legal fees, potential loss of federal funds and loss of state revenue. It has failed to move forward since February, when it was moved to the Senate Judiciary Committee and assigned to a House subcommittee.\n\nBoth the indecent exposure bill and the adoption bill advanced this month and will be heard in Senate committees on March 26. The sponsors of the indecent exposure bill amended the bill by removing references to transgender individuals.\n\nThe marriage and adoption bills have caused the greatest concerns to businesses, Woolley said.\n\n\"You are looking at trying to bring people to relocate from San Francisco or New York,\" Woolley said. \"The tech industry is trying to recruit and grow here. You have universities trying to attract. You have this very discriminatory adoption language that is stopping people from moving with their families to a state that would impose these.\"\n\nPerceptions of Nashville shift\n\nJeff Haithcoat, director of acquisitions and growth at the Vaco recruiting firm in Nashville, said companies including Warner Music and AllianceBernstein have asked about state legislation, but on the individual level, the questions are more general about city culture.\n\n\"They tend to focus more on questions like, what's the restaurant scene like, or what's the cost of living or what's the community in general,\" Haithcoat said. \"People want to know when they move somewhere they can be part of a community. Are there going to be people like me, whether that\u2019s race or religion or sexual orientation.\"\n\nWhile Nashville may have been lumped together with other Southern and more conservative areas in the past, that is not the case today, Haithcoat said.\n\n\"Even 10 years ago there was probably more of that, preconceptions of Nashville being uber conservative, very Republican,\" Haithcoat said. \"Nashville, especially in the last five years, has gotten the reputation of being very welcoming, very progressive-minded.\"\n\nSimilarly, Robert Half recruiter Eric South said he has not observed Nashville struggling with perception issues as a result of being in a socially conservative state.\n\n\"In the past six months, we've had people relocate here from the New England area, we've had people that have relocated from out west and California, we see a lot from the Midwest and Chicago,\" South said. \"Nashville is distinct compared to some other parts of the South.

It was up four points from the 91st ranking Memphis received in 2018.\n\nMemphis\u2019 highest score was in acreage, where it earned 60 out of 100. That number is calculated based on median park size and the percentage of the city\u2019s land dedicated to parks. Here 5 percent of the land is used for parks and recreation, according to the report. The national median is 15 percent.\n\n\n\nMemphis scored significantly lower in the investment category with 30 out of 100. That score is based on the amount of public and non-profit spending that goes toward parks, as well as the number of hours volunteers invest in parks.\n\nLower still, is Memphis\u2019 amenity score \u2014 25 out of 100. The group awards points in this category based on the availability of six key park amenities. The amenities include basketball hoops, off-leash dog parks, playgrounds, recreation and senior centers, restrooms, and splash pads.\n\nBased on the report, there are, 2.9 basketball hoops, 1.8 playgrounds, and .1 restrooms in parks per 10,000 residents. There are .3 splash pads and .6 dog parks per 100,000 residents. Recreation and senior centers rank in the highest percentile with .9 centers per 20,000 people.\n\nFinally, in the access category, Memphis\u2019 parks scored 20 out of 100. Accessibility is determined by the percentage of the population living within a 10-minute walk or a half mile of a park. Here 45 percent of residents live within that proximity to a park. The national average is 54 percent.\n\nThe report also breaks down accessibility based on demographics. It found that more low-income households here are within a half of mile of a park than both middle and high income households. Only 16,697 middle-income households, compared to more than 54,000 low-income households, are located within a half mile of a park.\n\nclick to enlarge Trust for Public Land,\n\nPercentage of Memphis living within a 10 minute walk of a park.\n\nMemphis Mayor Jim Strickland is one of more than 250 mayors across the country who have joined the Trust for Public Land\u2019s 10 Minute Walk campaign. Organized in partnership with the National Recreation and Park Association and the Urban Land Institute, the campaign aims to bring a park within a 10-minute walk to every household in the country by urging mayors to adopt long-term strategies to improve equitable access to quality parks.\n\nThe report also lists five ideal quarter-mile-radius areas for new parks here. Those locations are near the intersections of Getwell and New Willow, Kirby and Mt.

The redesign will have 15.9 acres of occupiable space, according to calculations done by Architecture, Inc. for Memphis in May. That\u2019s a drop from 14.5 acres to 5.6 acres of grass and a drop from 6 to 4.6 acres of roads and parking.

Those designs show three great lawns offering space for the stages in the Beale Street Music Festival with an increase in unobstructed square footage in front of the stages.\n\nTwo alternate plans for the barbecue contest can accommodate 285 teams in different sized booths, according to the Memphis River Parks Partnership.\n\nColetta said that next week, the two organizations will compare how their designers did the test fits and see what needs to change.\n\nShe\u2019s never seen the redesign as a conflict between a beautiful park for everyday usage and having a space for Memphis in May, she said.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s really incumbent upon us to have a park that will attract people 365 days a year and be a beautiful front door statement for our city and be a beautiful functional festival grounds,\u201d Coletta said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to work toward that end and I believe we\u2019ll get there.\u201d\n\n\u25ba Keep up with the latest in Memphis: Get The CA app\n\nKatherine Burgess covers county government and the suburbs.

King\u2019s Blues Club. But visitors can find a variety of sights and sounds nowadays in Beale\u2019s distinct mix of bars, restaurants and shops.\n\nIt took time for Beale to get on this firm of footing, despite its storied history. Here\u2019s how Beale Street rose into a center of black culture and opportunity, fell into disrepair and then transformed into the locus of Memphis nightlife and tourism.\n\nA Bluff City Bicentennial: From comic to tragic, here are 200 pieces of Memphis' history\n\nBeale Street\u2019s origins\n\nBeale Street came up around the 1840s originally as Beale Avenue. While affluent white suburbs comprised Beale\u2019s eastern end early on, shippers and cotton distributors drove the western portion, wrote developer John Elkington in \u201cBeale Street: Resurrecting the Home of the Blues.\u201d\n\nBeale\u2019s black population jumped due to Civil War displacements and Union Army occupation from 1862 to 1867, according to Elkington.\n\n\u201c\u2026Beale Street had fully become the cultural center and the local headquarters for commerce, politics and religion for blacks,\u201d he wrote. \u201cFrom 1866 to 1874, twenty black-owned businesses and a Freedman\u2019s Bank existed in the area.\u201d\n\nYellow fever wiped out much of Memphis\u2019 population later in 1878, leading to a devastated Beale Street. Robert Church, a wealthy former slave, bought up Beale-area land and opened the door to new economic opportunities for blacks.\n\nEarly life on Beale Street\n\nBeale\u2019s early nightlife featured plenty of fun, both legal and illegal. An eclectic mix of visiting country folks and high-end patrons concocted a swirl of drinking, gambling, pawning and prostitution in the district, wrote Robert Sigafoos in \u201cCotton Row to Beale Street: A Business History of Memphis.\u201d\n\nBut Beale\u2019s seedy reputation clouded its reality as a welcome escape for black people, who weren\u2019t welcome on Main Street. The black community could enjoy entertainment, restaurants and support black business, said Elaine Turner, founder of Heritage Tours in Memphis.\n\n\u201c[Beale Street's] patrons did their shopping for food and clothes there, saw their doctors, dentists and lawyers there, paid their burial insurance there,\" wrote Margaret McKee and Fred Chisenhall in \u201cBeale Black and Blue: Life and Music on Black America\u2019s Main Street.\u201d \"Many a Beale Streeter lived out his life without setting foot in Beale\u2019s saloons and gambling dens.\u201d\n\nNot to be ignored are Beale Street\u2019s Chinese merchants at the time. Chop Suey Caf\u00e9, opened by Chu C. Lau and Chu Lain as Oriental Caf\u00e9, ran for 47 years before closing in 1967, per Shelby County historian Jimmy Rout III. Chinese-owned laundries and grocery stores also had a presence.\n\nMusic's rise on Beale Street\n\nBut early Beale\u2019s most lasting impact is perhaps its many music clubs. Those working in the Mississippi Delta brought to Memphis a style that has stuck to this day.\n\n\u201cTheir Delta Blues was characterized by strong singing and hard dance rhythms, which came from their traveling in minstrel shows or playing in juke joints for dancing couples,\" wrote blues musician Edward \u201cPrince Gabe\u201d Kirby in \u201cFrom Africa to Beale Street.\u201d\n\nComposer W.C. Handy may not have been the first bluesman, but he took the Blues sound and put it on paper in the early 1900s. He wrote an influential campaign song for E.H. \"Boss\" Crump later known as \"The Memphis Blues,\" along with \"Beale Street Blues.\"\n\nFollowing Handy's prime, the post-Prohibition Jazz Age introduced Beale and the world to iconic talents like B.B. King, Louis Armstrong, Muddy Waters and many more.\n\nBeale's decline\n\nAfter the heyday of Beale Street\u2019s blues era, Beale Street slid into a slump that would last for more than a decade. Newspaper articles at the time described it as a \"ghost town.\"\n\nAt the end of the 1960s, the Memphis Housing Authority was beginning a targeted urban renewal effort that included Beale Street. The section of Beale Street between Second and Fourth streets had been declared a National Historic Landmark in 1966.\n\nThose planned projects, including Beale, were among what the MHA considered \u201csome of the city\u2019s worst remaining slums,\u201d according to a June 1971 Press-Scimitar story.\n\nIn some cases, neighborhoods were cleared to make way for other projects, according to an exhibit at Memphis\u2019 Rock \u2018N\u2019 Soul Museum.\n\n\u201cLocal black merchants, business owners and residents were devastated by their displacement from their original stores, restaurants and night spots that had made Memphis so unique,\" the exhibit states. \"The millions of dollars that were poured into urban renewal succeeded in creating some low-income housing, but the goals were never fully realized. Some areas were simply deserted after being razed.\u201d\n\nRedeveloping Beale Street\n\nAfter years of calls for African-American involvement in the Beale Street restoration, the nonprofit Beale Street Development Corp. was founded in 1973, with a mission of bringing the races together to revitalize the street.\n\n\"If specific plans aren't made to include us (black entrepreneurs), just the simple process of business will exclude us,\" then-Councilman Fred L. Davis told Memphis Housing Authority commissioners, according to the 1971 Press-Scimitar story.\n\nIn the early 1980s, Memphis city officials decided on the firm led by developer John Elkington, and awarded the company a decades-long contract, which tasked them with finding tenants and coordinating construction.\n\nIt took years to make money, and during that time, it was sometimes a challenge to make payroll, Elkington said.\n\nIn the early days of the redevelopment phase, there was a lot of turnover, and businesses were \u201cundercapitalized,\u201d Elkington said.\n\n\u201cNo one ever believed we would stay in business,\u201d he said.\n\nChange came in bursts, and there were multiple pivotal moments. Elkington called B.B. King\u2019s Blues Club coming in during the late 1980s a turning point, and that combined with Doe\u2019s Eat Place going in across Beale \u201cestablished that corner,\u201d he said.\n\nMoving Silky O\u2019Sullivan\u2019s to Beale from Overton Square, where it had been a fixture, was another big moment, Elkington said.\n\nWhen chain restaurants expressed interest in occupying space on Beale, they were often sent elsewhere.\n\n\u201cIt was important we tried to keep it as authentic as possible,\u201d Elkington said.\n\nThe New Year\u2019s Eve celebration taking off during the early 1990s, parades on Beale and redoing Handy Park were also big moments through the redevelopment period, Elkington said.\n\nRout, the historian, remembers seeing Beale Street start to surge again around the turn of the century, when a new generation of Memphians had grown up through the redevelopment period, were coming of age and able to patronize Beale\u2019s nightlife spots.\n\n\u201cIt was the place to go, it was the party place,\u201d Rout said.\n\nAround the same time, the managers, developers and the city got locked in a legal fight over the management of Beale, which would last for years. Elkington\u2019s firm later became known as Performa Entertainment. In 1999 the city sued the Beale Street Development Corp. for breach of lease; BSDC then sued Performa for the same reasons, and Performa countersued both. Performa and the city of Memphis settled litigation in 2010, a day before they were scheduled to go to court.\n\nMore recently, controversy reared up again when the Memphis City Council passed an as-needed cover charge to enter the Beale Street Entertainment District on particularly crowded nights.\n\nThe city of Memphis took back public control of Beale Street in 2014, and directed the Downtown Memphis Commission to handle day-to-day management of the street on an interim basis.\n\nMany of the current leases on Beale extend out more than a decade, but the city is expected to choose a permanent operator at some point. Since the Downtown Memphis Commission took over the management, two or three new tenants have come in on the historic street, but other than that, the businesses have been long-term tenants and \"little to no turnover at all,\" said Jon Shivers, director of Beale Street.\n\nAn app allows visitors to view details about some of Beale Street's marquee buildings, and the stories behind the musicians on the brass notes that line its sidewalks.\n\n\"We\u2019d like to develop that even more and make it into a historic walking tour, where someone can download the app and it\u2019s a truly interactive walking tour,\" Shivers said.\n\nFor Beale Street business owner Sandy Robertson, the future of the historic street should continue preserving its past, and it's still all about the music.\n\n\"It's a music street, it's known for music and people come down here to hear music. They love live music,\" Robertson said. \"So I think that's the road we stay on.\"\n\nMax Garland covers FedEx, logistics and health care for The Commercial Appeal.

Mark Levine, Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring issued an opinion that local leaders could sidestep Richmond entirely. The opinion clarified that the Arlington County Board had the authority to change the name on its own.\n\nIn an statement Wednesday, Levine wrote that today\u2019s event was important because the General Assembly named the highway after Davis long after the Civil War \u2014 in 1922 \u2014 and Davis himself few connections with Virginia.\n\n\u201cThe purpose instead was to terrorize Virginia\u2019s black population into submitting to unconstitutional second-class legal status under Virginia law,\u201d said Levine. \u201cIn 1922, Jim Crow laws, lynching, and the KKK were at their peak power, while poll taxes, literacy tests, and grandfather clauses kept the descendants of the courageous African-Americans who fought Davis and died for the Union from exercising their constitutional right to vote.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile it is necessary for us to honestly discuss and interpret Virginia\u2019s history, I feel strongly that commemorating the president of the Confederacy through the name for a major thoroughfare is not appropriate,\u201d Virginia\u2019s Commonwealth Transportation Board Secretary said after approving the name change in May.\n\nThe highway was named after Davis at the request of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, a group which sponsored confederate monuments across the south in the 20th century, including a now-removed plaque in Bluemont Park. In 1946, the group also commissioned a stone marker along the highway bearing Jefferson Davis\u2019 name, which county or state transportation officials are not quite sure what to do about.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m proud of Mark Levine for getting this through,\u201d said Freddie Lutz, owner of longtime Crystal City LGBT bar Freddie\u2019s Beach Bar, who attended this morning\u2019s ceremony. \u201cIt\u2019s a great, progressive move. I\u2019m all about celebrating diversity.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a long time coming,\u201d Levine said. \u201cIt\u2019s a sign of oppression. It was wrong to put it up [then] and it was wrong today.\u201d\n\nLevine added that having himself and Dorsey personally take the Jefferson Davis sign down \u201cwasn\u2019t planned that way, but it\u2019s wonderful symbolic justice.\u201d\n\nOfficials previously estimated that total cost of changing Jefferson Davis Highway to Richmond Highway in Arlington would be around $17,000, and that work would continue through October.\n\nAlexandria voted to nix the name last year. Earlier this year Google Maps began display the new name on the Arlington portion of the highway.\n\n\u201cWe are thrilled about the overdue name change,\u201d Tracy Sayegh Gabriel, President of the Crystal City Business Improvement District, told ARLnow. \u201cIt\u2019s much more consistent with our values \u2014 and provides a progressive and inclusive environment to live and work.\u201d\n\nJay Westcott contributed to this report.", "title": "First 'Richmond Highway' Signs Now Up Along Route 1 in Crystal City", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "['transportation']", "annot_city": "['Richmond']"}, {"id": 344, "city": "['Richmond, VA']", "url": "https://wtvr.com/2019/03/14/despite-foia-request-city-of-richmond-refuses-to-detail-overtime-pay-of-employees/", "text": "RICHMOND, Va. -- As Richmond taxpayers face a possible ticking up in their property taxes, CBS 6 wanted to know how much money city employees each make in overtime compared to their counterparts in Henrico and Chesterfield.\n\nAfter requesting the numbers from all three through the Freedom of Information Act Request, Henrico and Chesterfield quickly handed them over, but Richmond refused.\n\n\"This is what astounds me, is that really an option?\" Richmond resident Daniela Shew said.\n\nTechnically, yes, the city can decline to release the information because the law does not mandate the disclosure of individual personnel's overtime pay - but the law doesn't say they can't be released.\n\nThe city's decision doesn't sit well with taxpayers we spoke to.\n\n\"We need to see that,\" Richmond resident Barbara Womack-Bradby said.\n\n\"It makes you suspicious.

Creasy, the team that also includes two other full-time and one part-time staff works out of the City of Richmond Radio Shop, also known as the Technical Division of the Department of Emergency Communications. It\u2019s located at 3506 Hopkins Road in South Side.\n\n\u201cThese days, it\u2019s a lot more than radios,\u201d said Karen L. Gill, spokesperson for Emergency Communications.\n\nThe division\u2019s budget is tiny, about $1.3 million a year, while the productivity ranks high among city agencies.\n\nIn the course of a year, the Radio Shop staff will work on hundreds of vehicles, ranging from dump trucks and school buses to fire trucks, paint trucks and police cars, boats and motorcycles.\n\n\u201cThe only thing we have not worked on is an aircraft,\u201d Mr. Creasy said.\n\nCommunications between vehicles and with call centers are still a mainstay. The team is at the center of the $40 million city project now underway to replace public safety communications equipment in police cars, fire trucks, ambulances and other vehicles.\n\nThe city\u2019s overhaul of public safety communications, which is expected to be completed in 2021, is part of a regional effort to make it easier for police officers, firefighters and public safety employees from different agencies to talk with one another and a dispatcher. The total cost across the region could top $150 million.\n\nThe technicians not only work on city vehicles, but they also install sensors, technology and communications equipment into vehicles belonging to Virginia Commonwealth University, Virginia Union University, the Richmond Ambulance Authority and the Richmond Metropolitan Transportation Authority, among others, Mr. Creasy said.\n\nThese organizations get vehicles from the manufacturer as basic models, just as an individual might order, Ms. Gill said. The vehicles are then sent to the division\u2019s shop to be upgraded with the technology that turns them into specialized vehicles.\n\nFor example, the city fire marshal\u2019s SUV has been equipped with sensors that monitor conditions in the space in which dogs that assist in arson investigations ride.\n\nThe team also adds specialized lighting to police detectives\u2019 cruisers.\n\n\u201cThe technology is so detailed now, we can do really crazy stuff on the computer,\u201d Mr. Creasy said. \u201cWe get to build some really cool things. We get to make different light patterns and functions and put them where you can\u2019t even see them. We\u2019re pretty good at hiding stuff.\u201d\n\nMr. Creasy said he and his staff work with governmental customers to learn about problems they might have and to find solutions, such as the automatic shutoffs of sirens and lights for ambulances.\n\n\n\nThat has been his focus, he said, since he moved into the Richmond shop in 2015 after working as an installer in Chesterfield County\u2019s radio shop. Promoted to supervisor in 2017, he said the ability to solve problems is the top skill he looks for in hiring technicians.\n\n\u201cOur people have to think on the fly to problem solve,\u201d Mr. Creasy said. \u201cIf things are not working when they should be, the people in our shop have to figure out why. If we can\u2019t get the parts we need, then we make them. If what we\u2019re doing isn\u2019t working, we have to change how we work.\u201d\n\nHe said the trend has been for governmental agencies to outsource radio work. But he said the city\u2019s radio shop has proven itself. He said few private shops can match the city team\u2019s ingenuity, speed and experience in electronics, mechanics and metal fabrication.\n\nPlus, the work is fun for people who like working on cars and trucks, Mr. Creasy said.\n\n\u201cInstead of fixing the brakes, changing oil filters or repairing engines, our team gets paid to install cameras in vehicles,\u201d he said. \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t like that?\u201d", "title": "Small City of Richmond Radio Shop produces big results", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Richmond']"}, {"id": 346, "city": "['Richmond, VA']", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/us/richmond-virginia-a-city-still-enslaved-by-its-confederate-past-1.3835454", "text": "Two hours\u2019 drive south of Washington DC, the factory chimneys and elevated rail tracks of Richmond appear on the horizon.\n\nThe capital city of Virginia, Richmond was once the industrial heartland of the region. It also holds an important place in American history. After war broke out between the Union north and the Confederate south in 1861 and Virginia seceded from the Union, Richmond became the capital of the Confederacy, due in part to its strategic location as a major transport and logistical hub for steamboats and railroads.\n\nMore than 150 years on from the American Civil War, Virginia\u2019s complex legacy on race, slavery and power continues to haunt the state.\n\nVirginia was plunged into crisis this year when pictures emerged of governor Ralph Northam in a college yearbook. Northam admitted he was one of two people in a photograph \u2013 one dressed as a Ku Klux Klan member, the other in \u201cblackface\u201d \u2013 though he later said he was not sure either of the people was him.\n\nFurther scandal ensued when the second-in-command at the state legislature, lieutenant governor Justin Fairfax, was accused of sexual assault, while the third most senior ranking Democrat, state attorney-general Mark Herring, admitted that he wore blackface at a college party in 1980. Herring had initially called for Northam\u2019s resignation.\n\nThe final upshot was that all three have kept their positions, but the controversy has threatened to undermine the legitimacy of the Democratic Party in the state, which has made major electoral strides in recent years fuelled in part by anti-Trump sentiment.\n\nRace relations\n\nThe fact that Northam has kept his job \u2013 despite widespread calls to resign from senior figures in the Democratic Party including Nancy Pelosi and his predecessor Terry McAuliffe \u2013 illustrates the idiosyncrasies of Virginia\u2019s relationship with its past when it comes to race relations.\n\nOne of the first states established after British settlers arrived in Jamestown in 1607, Virginia\u2019s rapid development as a political and economic hub was bound up with a parallel history of repression and slavery. This year the state will mark the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the first slaves from west Africa to English-speaking America. In 1619, a ship docked in Fort Monroe, just outside Richmond, carrying a cargo of enslaved Africans.\n\nOver subsequent centuries the economy of the new world, particularly in the south, grew exponentially, powered by the economics of free slave labour. The port city of Richmond was at the heart of this thriving industry. By the time of the Civil War \u2013 a war essentially fought over slavery \u2013 Richmond was home to the second-largest slave market in the country.\n\nSlave-dealers took rooms in the nearby hotels, while slaves were kept in filthy underground holding facilities nearby\n\nToday, in downtown Richmond, the story of Virginia\u2019s history \u2013 and of America itself \u2013 is evident in the urban spaces and public buildings. Presiding over the city is the impressive Virginia State Capitol. Designed by Thomas Jefferson, one of the founding founders of the American republic and the third American president, the neoclassical building reflected the confidence of a new democracy.\n\nHalf a mile away, just under a busy underpass, stands a small sign with the words \u201cSlave Auction Site\u201d. It was here that hundreds of thousands of slaves were bought and sold throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. Slave-dealers and merchants took rooms in the nearby hotels, now long gone, while slaves were kept in filthy underground holding facilities nearby.\n\nDark chapter\n\nToday, there are few signs of the industry that once dominated this part of the city. But the memories of this dark chapter of the city\u2019s past are never far from the surface.\n\nRichmond\u2019s troubled history is also on display in the visual iconography of the city in other ways. Just west of the centre is Monument Avenue, a grand boulevard dotted with statues to southern \u201cheroes\u201d of the American Civil War. The first statue, a memorial to Robert E Lee, was erected in 1890 \u2013 part of a process of cultural appropriation in the south that sought to celebrate the pro-slavery Confederate leaders in the decades after the war.\n\nDespite the events in nearby Charlottesville in the summer of 2017, which saw far-right neo-nazis flock to the city\u2019s Confederate statues, prompting national outrage, most of Virginia\u2019s monuments still stand. Last month a Bill to grant local authorities the power to remove statues was defeated. For now, it seems, they are here to stay.\n\nAs the Ralph Northam controversy shows, despite efforts at reconciliation and remorse in recent decades, Virginia is not quite able to leave its past behind.", "title": "Richmond, Virginia: a city still enslaved by its Confederate past", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Richmond']"}, {"id": 347, "city": "['New Orleans']", "url": "https://tulanehullabaloo.com/47552/views/new-orleans-must-find-new-ways-to-preserve-its-history/", "text": "It is uncanny how visiting the city before and after Hurricane Katrina, the comparatively touristy parts of the city recovered to almost exactly how they were before. With tourism as a central part of the city\u2019s economy, New Orleans throws a lot of money at retaining its appeal to visitors, maintaining one of the most well-preserved cultural centers of art, music and architecture.\n\nThe city, however, is also struggling to reconcile what that means going forward. With the recent debate over whether to remove Confederate war symbols, many residents have opened their eyes to the possibility that not all preservation is good preservation. New Orleans now faces the challenge of both maintaining its heritage and still being able to evolve socially.\n\nHow? Festivals. One of the first things every Tulane student hears from an enthusiastic tour guide is the quick fact that New Orleans allegedly has more individual festivals than there are days of the year. Festivals themselves have long since been an fundamental part of the culture of the city. Additionally, the integration of new festivals and the evolution of the existing ones have allowed New Orleans to keep its heritage, while still including new social values and ideas.\n\nTwo weekends past provides a great example. The French Quarter Festival, which first started in 1984, is a large gathering of art and music celebrated in the most historic part of the city. With the art coming from all different types of artists in both modern and traditional styles, ever since the beginning, French Quarter Fest has exemplified the path New Orleans has been able to find in combining its incredible heritages with the new and constantly changing culture of its inhabitants.\n\nSouthern Decadence is another festival that has found its way in as part of the expanding social sphere. The festival, sometimes dubbed \u201cthe gay Mardi Gras\u201d started in 1972 by an increasingly prevalent LGBTQ community. The festival utilizes the historic venue of the French Quarter, and it capitalizes on the tourist and party capacities of the city to host six-day-long celebration of diversity. The rise of the festival marks the dramatic evolution of the city\u2019s culture.\n\nLastly, the biggest exhibition of New Orleans\u2019s dedication to preserving its cultural heritage arrives this weekend during the Jazz and Heritage Festival. The Jazz and Heritage Festival was initially hosted on the site of Congo Square, the historic heart of the city\u2019s African American community.\n\nWhen created, the festival was designed to celebrate the music and culture that originated in New Orleans and Louisiana. Jazz Fest is a particularly good example of how the city has expanded culturally while still valuing its heritage because of how big its grown. Jazz Fest was moved to the fairgrounds because its original location became too small to hold the full extravaganza. Rather than switching out the older or less common music styles for modern popular music, the festival just grew. Now music at the festival includes everything imaginable, from jazz to rock to pop to folk and any number of other genres. The festival little by little incorporated all the aspects of the cities growing culture.\n\nNew Orleans has to decide how to handle the physical preservation of its history. The preservation of its cultural heritage, however, will live on as long as the city\u2019s residents continue to find ways to celebrate it. It is often said that New Orleanians will find any excuse to party, but maybe it\u2019s better to say that New Orleanians are proud and happy to live in their city.", "title": "New Orleans must find new ways to preserve its history \u2022 The Tulane Hullabaloo", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['New Orleans']"}, {"id": 348, "city": "['New Orleans']", "url": "https://apnews.com/ecfee7dfa2a64453a7b371c1d02c087f", "text": "The Mississippi River approaches a levee at left in New Orleans, La., Thursday, July 11, 2019, ahead of Tropical Storm Barry.

Never in the modern history of New Orleans has water from the Mississippi River overtopped the city\u2019s levees. (AP Photo/Matthew Hinton)\n\nEven as Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, the Mississippi River\u2019s levees held up when those in other parts of the city did not.\n\nBut as Tropical Storm Barry threatened New Orleans with torrential rains that will test the city\u2019s flood defenses this weekend, the height of the city\u2019s river levees was the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers\u2019 greatest concern, spokesman Ricky Boyett said Thursday.\n\nFull Coverage: Tropical Storm Barry\n\nThe danger to New Orleans \u2014 bound by the Mississippi River on its south side, Lake Pontchartrain on its north side and tributaries leading into the nearby Gulf of Mexico on the east \u2014 is threefold: storm surges from the sea, rain from the sky and water from the rising river if the levees fail.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile the Corps wasn\u2019t expecting the swollen river to spill over into the city, the threat from Barry was real with a storm that was forecast to dump 10 to 20 inches (25 to 50 centimeters) of rain on New Orleans through Sunday, with isolated areas getting 25 inches (64 centimeters).\n\nThe river was expected to crest at about 19 feet (5.8 meters) on Saturday in New Orleans, where the levees protecting it from the water range from about 20 to 25 feet (6 to 7.5 meters) in height, said Jeff Graschel, a hydrologist with the National Weather Service.\n\nThe weather service also was expecting the water to stay below the river\u2019s levees, which haven\u2019t been overtopped in New Orleans since the early 1920s. But state officials warned that a change in the storm\u2019s direction or intensity could change that.\n\nTo prepare, workers were shoring up at least two areas along the city\u2019s levee system, Boyett said. They piled up \u201cstoplogs,\u201d or metal beams, and topped them with sheet metal to add height to Harvey Lock, a break in the levee across the river from the city\u2019s Lower 9th Ward, which was all but wiped out during Katrina. Workers also used Hesco baskets, a type of flood barrier, to add 3 feet (almost 1 meter) to the river levee at the Corps\u2019 headquarters in New Orleans.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re confident in the integrity of the levees,\u201d Boyett said. \u201cThey\u2019re designed to hold this pressure.\u201d\n\nBut 14 years after Katrina\u2019s monster storm surge roared ashore and inundated most of the city, many New Orleans residents still distrust the Corps, which built the levees and floodwalls that failed near Lake Pontchartrain and along the Lower 9th Ward.\n\nWhile the levees protecting the city from the Mississippi River held during the August 2005 storm, the flooding was exacerbated by the size and configuration of a shipping channel that the Corps dredged decades ago between New Orleans and the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\u201cThe models for Hurricane Katrina were all wrong,\u201d said Levees.org president Sandy Rosenthal, who founded the grassroots organization shortly after Katrina. \u201cWe don\u2019t care what the model says. The model is an educated guess. That\u2019s all it is.\u201d\n\nResidents waited nervously as the storm approached.\n\nCooter Brown\u2019s Tavern, a popular bar less than one-quarter mile from the Corps\u2019 headquarters in New Orleans, didn\u2019t flood during Katrina. But co-owner Ivan Burgess said they were debating whether to stay open or close this weekend given concerns about Barry\u2019s flood risks.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been really lucky, but that\u2019s only part of it. We have our employees\u2019 safety to consider,\u201d he said.\n\nAuthor and historian John Barry, who served on a board that was created after Katrina to oversee the levee system of greater New Orleans on the east bank of the Mississippi River, said he was \u201cvery confident\u201d in the structural integrity of the river levees and would be \u201castounded\u201d if they breached.\n\n\u201cBecause engineers built them correctly,\u201d he added. \u201cThey were built against the worst-case scenario they could imagine.\u201d\n\n___\n\nKunzelman reported from College Park, Maryland.", "title": "New Orleans\u2019 levees face a hard test as storm bears down", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['New Orleans']"}, {"id": 349, "city": "['New Orleans']", "url": "https://midcitymessenger.com/2019/05/20/what-can-and-cannot-be-recycled-in-new-orleans-and-why/", "text": "A crisis in the recycling industry is reflected in what we can and cannot put in our recycling bins starting with this week\u2019s pickup, the city announced.\n\nHere\u2019s what can go into the bin for curbside recycling pickup:\n\nPlastics: Only #1 (soda/water bottles) and #2 (milk/juice/shampoo/detergent containers);\n\nPaper: Newspapers, junk mail, phone books, catalogs, office paper; corrugated cardboard, boxboard (cereal boxes/soft drink boxes);\n\nMetal: Small aluminum and steel cans.\n\nPlastics #3 through #7, wax board (juice boxes/milk cartons) and plastic bags will no longer be accepted by the city\u2019s collection contractors.

As always, Styrofoam, containers with food, and greasy pizza boxes are not accepted in the curbside program or at the Recycling Drop-Off Center. Don\u2019t place your recyclables in plastic bags (bags are accepted for recycling in bins at some supermarkets).\n\nThe curbside recycling program in New Orleans was at risk of ending entirely. Metro Services Group, one of the city\u2019s collection contractors, received notice from its recycling processor, Republic Services, that it would suspend acceptance of items from residential, single stream, curbside collections effective May 17, the Mayor\u2019s Office stated in a press release.\n\nRepublic cited rising costs as a result of China\u2019s ban on the imports of previously accepted types of recyclable materials and changes in contamination level requirements in the global market as the reason for the indefinite suspension.\n\nThis announcement required a rapid response by Metro Service Group to secure a change in processors. Although alternative arrangements were successfully completed, the suspension by Republic Services highlighted the current recycling situation on the national, regional and local level.\n\nThe city and its contractors scrambled to find a way to improve the marketability of recycled items and reduce contamination. That\u2019s why it is no longer accepting plastics #3 through #7, wax board (juice boxes/milk cartons) or plastic bags at either curbside collection or the Recycling Drop-Off Center on Elysian Fields Avenue.\n\n\u201cWe recognize just how important our recycling program is for our people and our city, so we worked alongside Metro, the local business community and our national resilience network to find a solution,\u201d said Ramsey Green, Deputy CAO for Infrastructure and Chief Resilience Officer, in the press release.\n\nRecycling is facing significant challenges. The city urges residents to reduce the amount and types of items purchased and to reuse items. Recent articles on recycling note that the majority of the material collected in recycling programs remains in the United States and is used in the production of consumer goods.\n\nGreen added: \u201cWe must all do our part to reduce contamination to assist collection, processing and manufacturing companies until new and expanded markets are developed. Although contamination from our area has not exceeded generally acceptable levels, it can be reduced further. It is our hope that these actions will assist in extending the life of the city\u2019s recycling programs.\u201d", "title": "What can and cannot be recycled in New Orleans, and why \u2013 Mid-City Messenger", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "['recycle']", "annot_city": "['New Orleans']"}, {"id": 350, "city": "['New Orleans']", "url": "https://thelensnola.org/2019/07/01/new-orleans-becomes-first-major-american-city-without-traditional-schools/", "text": "On a typically hot July 1 in south Louisiana, when many students and educators are enjoying long holiday vacations, New Orleans has quietly become the first major American city without any traditional schools.\n\nThe Orleans Parish school district has teetered on the edge of an all-charter district for years. Each year the number of the district\u2019s direct-run schools has dwindled as some have closed and others have converted or been taken over by charter organizations. During the 2018-2019 school year, the district ran just three schools directly, and that was only after unexpectedly taking control of two struggling charter schools.\n\nThe last school to convert, McDonogh 35 Senior High School, is doing so as part of a two-part plan to shut down the traditional school and restart it as a charter. The historic school needed a reset after years of declining scores, Superintendent Henderson Lewis Jr. said last year when he announced the changes.\n\n\u201cMy goal is to bring McDonogh 35 back into its premiere position as an academically successful, first-tier high school and this is the best step forward,\u201d Lewis said in December.\n\nEach of the last three years, the district has been poised to become all-charter, but each time, charter groups have withdrawn applications to run schools, or district officials have decided to change course. The district wound up waiting an extra year to hand McDonogh 35 over to a nonprofit.\n\nThat group, InspireNOLA, has grown with a wave of charter operators that followed the state\u2019s post-Katrina intervention in New Orleans\u2019 public schools.\n\nCharter schools in New Orleans are run by nonprofit groups that receive a contract from either the state or the district. In exchange for the ability to select curriculum, staff and set their own calendars, they must meet certain academic and financial standards each year. Charter schools receive a 5-year contract and if they pass an initial review after three years they are able to apply for a renewal. Renewal contracts can last anywhere between three and 10-years depending on the school\u2019s performance.\n\nThe state-run Recovery School District took over dozens of the city\u2019s schools in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, eventually closing or converting all of them to charter schools. Louisiana\u2019s first charter school law was passed in 1995, but there were only a handful of charters in New Orleans before the storm.\n\nJuly 1 is important for the school district. It\u2019s the day charter school contracts begin and also marks the start of the fiscal year. One year ago, the city\u2019s RSD charters all transferred back to the local school district\u2019s oversight. That nearly doubled the size of the district.\n\nLast year, the district was on track to have only one traditional school: McDonogh 35. But it ended up taking over two struggling elementary charter schools and running them directly instead.\n\nIn May 2018, Cypress Academy\u2019s former governing nonprofit board abruptly announced that the school would not reopen for the 2018-2019 school year. The district took over the school \u2014 which served a large number of special education students \u2014 to avoid the sudden closure. Initially, Lewis said the district would manage Cypress for two years, but in November, he announced that Cypress would be closed and its students transferred to Foundation Preparatory after the school year ended.\n\nAnother charter, Edgar P. Harney Spirit of Excellence Academy, had myriad financial irregularities and was found to have been providing inadequate special education services. The district forced it to surrender its charter, taking it over in January. Harney also closed after the end of the 2018-2019 school year.\n\nDistrict officials say they are focusing on replicating highly rated schools to create more seats for students. The majority of D and F-rated schools in Orleans Parish during the 2018-19 school year were ones that returned from the Recovery School District. Lewis closed four of them, but only the ones that were up for contract renewal.\n\nEducation reform advocates have claimed success as test scores and graduation rates have risen. But other groups remain skeptical, noting exams and the state\u2019s grading formula have changed often and that holding charters accountable appears to be an ongoing challenge for the Orleans Parish school district. In addition, schools no longer have a large district to rely on for costly services. That has driven more money to administration and away from the classroom, according to one study.\n\nIn its heavily decentralized system, the school district created a number of new positions last summer to monitor charter schools and started tracking the smallest of legal requirements that affect the public, such as boards that fail to post their board meeting minutes online. The district also began telling families at charter schools when their schools will be up for contract renewals \u2014 a make-or-break year that can result in school closures.\n\nThe district-created \u201cCharter School Framework that was designed to equip OPSB with the foundational tools to hold schools accountable annually and at the point of renewal,\u201d said a statement, attributed to the Orleans Parish School Board, that the district provided to The Lens on Monday.\n\nAsked about the move to an all-charter city, Nahliah Webber, the executive director of the Orleans Parish Education Network, said she doesn\u2019t expect much to change. OPEN is a nonprofit that advocates for inclusive, transparent, and community-aligned public policy.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve kind of been operating under the understanding that it was already an all-charter system,\u201d she said.\n\nAdvocates like Webber worry about the district\u2019s ability to hold the nearly three dozen independent nonprofit organizations that run the city\u2019s roughly 75 schools accountable. Those concerns are especially heightened in light of the recent grade-fixing scandal at John F. Kennedy High School. The problem, first reported by The Lens in March, led to a review of senior transcripts, uncovering problems that went well beyond grade inflation. A close examination of student records revealed 92 of 177 seniors were not eligible for graduation. Most of the ineligible students didn\u2019t learn that until a month after walking at their commencement ceremony.\n\n\u201cOur biggest concern is that we can\u2019t have reactive accountability,\u201d Webber said, after mentioning Kennedy\u2019s seniors, some of whom are now in summer school. \u201cWe can\u2019t wait until half the students of a graduating class are found to be ineligible for graduation before OPSB steps in.\u201d\n\nIn response to the findings, Lewis called for the state Inspector General\u2019s Office to open a criminal investigation into Kennedy. He\u2019s also ordered an audit of all high school students\u2019 records citywide. It\u2019s a tall order but one he said was necessary to ensure what happened at Kennedy doesn\u2019t happen again.\n\nLewis\u2019 office appears to be adding more staff to focus on accountability, according to a district statement issued Monday.\n\n\u201cOPSB is continually assessing how best to strengthen and improve its oversight of schools,\u201d an emailed statement from the board said. \u201cGiven that, we have identified the need for additional capacity and expertise on our accountability team along with new on-going oversight tools, like we will implement on our annual site visits this fall for high schools.\u201d\n\nThe last traditional school\n\nMcDonogh 35, the first public high school for African-Americans in New Orleans, was highly regarded for decades. Its list of alumni includes Ernest \u201cDutch\u201d Morial, the city\u2019s first black mayor, and former New Orleans Police Department Chief Michael Harrison. But the school\u2019s state standardized test scores have been on the decline for years, which Lewis said was a major part of his decision.\n\nThe district tried and failed for years to charter McDonogh 35. When those efforts were unsuccessful, and as the school\u2019s academic performance slumped, it decided to phase out the school and restart it. This year, the high school didn\u2019t have new ninth grade students. But the only contractor who qualified to close out the school had problems of its own. So the district opted to run the school for the 2018-19 school year.\n\nOver the last school year, the district awarded charter group InspireNOLA two contracts related to the school. The first was a contract to see McDonogh 35\u2019s older students through graduation. The second, a charter contract, allows the group to start a ninth grade academy this fall. It will add one grade each year until it\u2019s a full high school.\n\nWith the official move to an all-charter model, Webber said she\u2019s concerned the system is \u201cdigging in its heels.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe model is not bearing out the promises that it made,\u201d she said.\n\nA 2018 report by The Education Research Alliance found that the switch to charter schools resulted in substantial improvements in student achievement, graduation rates and college entry. And polling by the Cowen Institute last year found that 60 percent of respondents said that charter schools have improved education in the city. And 55 percent said that the city\u2019s \u201copen enrollment model,\u201d eliminating geographically based enrollment, has improved public education.\n\nStill, Webber noted that a large number of the city\u2019s schools are rated a D or F.\n\n\u201cYou have been unshackled from the school in your neighborhood,\u201d Webber said. \u201cBut what does that mean?\u201d\n\nShe pointed to schools with poor ratings that are nearly all black or hispanic. Meanwhile, she said white students are often overrepresented at schools with better ratings.\n\n\u201cThe ultimate choice is those who can chose out of the system altogether.\u201d\n\nIn recent years, the district has taken a more hands-on approach to monitoring charters. Last year, it preemptively halted enrollment at four charters it did not think would be open this coming fall. Indeed they are all closed, a decision made by Lewis.\n\nWebber said she hopes the district will change that enforcement model.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t close your way to a good school system,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen the district stepped in at Cypress Academy and forced Harney give up its charter midyear, it took over direct operations. A district statement said that has prepared them for future takeovers.\n\n\u201cGiven our work this past year at Cypress Academy and Harney Elementary School, OPSB had gathered first-hand experience of what additional resources, policies, and staffing is needed if and when such a takeover is required,\u201d a statement released by the district said.\n\nStill, Webber thinks the district needs to be more proactive. If it sees a problem at one school, she thinks it should be examining similar schools for the same issue.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been really hard lately to see how the system is going to be able to sustain itself when we have a reactive accountability structure.\u201d", "title": "New Orleans becomes first major American city without traditional schools", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "['school']", "annot_city": "['New Orleans']"}, {"id": 351, "city": "['New Orleans']", "url": "https://www.bigeasymagazine.com/2019/06/28/new-orleans-will-become-first-u-s-city-to-join-women4climate-mentorship-program/", "text": "On Thursday, June 27, Mayor LaToya Cantrell announced that the City of New Orleans will become the first U.S. city to participate in the C40 Women4Climate Mentorship Program.\n\n\u201cAs the first woman to be elected Mayor of New Orleans, I am proud to announce that our city will be he first from the U.S. to participate in the Women4Climate Mentorship Program,\u201d Cantrell said. \u201cWomen are effective leaders, critical problem solvers, and passionate champions for the strong and sustainable future we all want.

That means network monitoring. Knowing what's happening on your network is critical to responding to any undesired activity. However, operational technology (OT) network monitoring tools lag far behind traditional IT solutions, which aren't a good fit for industrial control systems.\n\nIn addition to network monitoring, Worley wanted the ability to actively query programmable logic controllers (PLCs) at water treatment plants to discover any changes in programming logic \u2014 by an employee, a systems integrator, or a malicious third party.\n\nCity of Raleigh Steve Worley, City of Raleigh SCADA security manager\n\nRather than develop a solution in-house, he chose to deploy the Indegy network monitoring tool. \"We were looking to have more robust network monitoring for our network that spans across a large area of the county,\" he tells CSO.\n\nWorley considered developing a solution in-house using open source tools, but concluded that would be too time-consuming. The city published an RFP and considered their options. \"We looked at all the major vendors in the realm of network monitoring of SCADA/ICS networks,\" he tells CSO by email. \"Indegy\u2019s active monitoring of the PLCs and network was a major part of the decision to go with them.\"\n\nThe project has since won a CS050 award.\n\nICS monitoring provides greater visibility\n\nAfter implementing the solution, Worley says he now has dramatically greater real-time visibility into what's happening on his network, a step he says other water works around the country should consider taking. \"People are hesitant because they fear it's going to interfere with the operations or cause a PLC to malfunction,\" he says. \"But there are ways to do network monitoring and even a little bit of active monitoring safely and securely on OT networks.\"\n\nSafety has always been a priority when it comes to industrial control systems. Throw security into the mix, and the problem gets more challenging.\n\nProtecting water treatment plants\n\nWhile Worley is worried about nation-state activity on his network, he's equally concerned about accidents, malfunctions, operator error, malicious insiders \u2014 even hurricanes. \"In North Carolina we get some pretty severe weather events every once in a while,\" he tells CSO. \"We need to know when our equipment is up and running and when it's not.\"\n\nThe solution, Worley says, is network monitoring and timely patching. \"The basics of cybersecurity you still need to do on the OT side,\" he says. \"People are scared to do it sometimes and maybe that's a takeaway.\"\n\n\"It's complex. It's hard to figure out how to patch your systems. It's hard to figure out how to monitor your systems,\" he adds. \"Just because it's a hard problem doesn't mean you can't move forward and improve your cybersecurity posture.\"\n\nInsider threats are also a concern. After the infamous Maroochydore, Queensland, incident in Australia when a disgruntled water works employee dumped millions of liters of raw sewage into local rivers, water treatment facilities have had to manage the risk of a privileged user abusing their trust to do something malicious.\n\nSince the Indegy solution gives the City of Raleigh real-time, granular visibility into not only the network, but all the PLCs as well, Worley feels confident that such an attack would be discovered and stopped. The monitoring tools creates an audit trail of all changes, making it easy to trace back security incidents to their root cause.\n\nAs for nation-state adversaries? Worley says he's yet to see evidence of such activity on his network. \"It is something we keep an eye on,\" he says. \"One of the reasons we got this tool is to help monitor that better.

And in April, the museum is celebrating a month of special programs as part of Raleigh History Month to celebrate the city's cultural heritage and encourage the public to explore the city's historic sites.\n\nThose activities include several walking tours, such as a Civil War-themed excursion on April 6, an architecture tour on April 13 and an African American history walking tour on April 20. The walks are probably best for kids ages 12 and up or so. More information about the tours and tickets is on the museum's website.\n\nAnd on April 5, the museum will open a new exhibit thanks to a collaboration with students at Moore Square Magnet Middle School. \"Our Families\u2019 Treasures\" is an exhibit that focuses on the important objects that students have in their life and tells the story of their families.

Admission is free though donations of $5 for adults are encouraged. There's also a small gift shop on site.\n\nWhat you'll see\n\nThe museum features several exhibits that explore various of aspects and personalities of Raleigh.\n\nAt the entrance to the museum, you'll see Raleigh Then, Raleigh Now, Raleigh Next, which tells the city's story through various artifacts and images with interactive kiosks. On the other side of the room is a display on Raleigh politics (with more screens and buttons for kids to push).\n\nAs you move back, you'll pass through exhibits on Civil Rights in Raleigh, the political cartoons of Dwane Powell and the history of Dix Hill, now home to a massive park.\n\nWhat makes it kid friendly?\n\nAt the entrance to the museum's exhibits, kids might enjoy seeing the artifacts or manipulating the various buttons and screens. They'll also find a collection of dress-up clothes, including World War II uniforms, that they can try on.\n\nA hands-on history cart is usually stationed nearby. It features a rotating collection of items that visitors can pick up, touch and check out. When we were there, the cart included a stereoscope, which makes images appear three dimensional; a telegraph machine that we could punch out Morse code on; and an old matchbox holder.\n\n\"Honestly, adults love this too,\" said Megan Raby, the museum's assistant director.\n\nAnd there's more for kids to do as you move toward the back of the museum.\n\nIn the exhibit about Powell, the Draw Your Thoughts wall is hot spot for visitors of all ages, who get to actually draw on the wall. Visitors spend a lot of time developing their own versions of Powell's work or creating something entirely their own.\n\n\"Who gets to draw on a wall in a museum?\" said Ernest Dollar, the museum's director.\n\nIn the Dix Hill exhibit, visitors can share what they hope will be included as Raleigh develops the property into a park (let me just add another vote for \"playground with desserts\" as one child requested) and a sound booth where you can record your own thoughts or memories about the land, which was once home to a psychiatric hospital.\n\nNodding to the property's prior use, visitors also are encouraged to complete a picture of what they feel like on the inside and what they look like on the outside.

And in years to come?\n\nFischer's team has said there's a roughly $35 million hole in the upcoming budget.\n\nAbout $20 million of that \u2014 last year's $9.4 million, plus about $10.4 million this year \u2014 is from the rising pension obligations the KRS board put into place.\n\nThe other $15 million stems from increasing health care costs and lower-than-expected revenue, according to Daniel Frockt, the city's chief financial officer.\n\nThe mayor's office expects that the pension costs will rise by roughly $10 million for each of the next four budget cycles, meaning that the budget hole will grow to $65 million by fiscal year 2023.\n\nWhat's Mayor Fischer's plan to fix it?\n\nFischer has laid out two options to handle the shortfall: devastating cuts that would harm the delivery of city services, or tripling the insurance premium tax on policies except for health and vehicle insurance.\n\nHe's embarked on a citywide tour of agencies that would be affected by the potential cuts, like Louisville Fire and Louisville Metro Police, making the case that the cuts are not an option for a \"city on the rise.\" His preferred alternative is the tax hike.\n\nThat proposal, which is being sponsored by five Democrats on the Metro Council, would increase the insurance premium tax from 5 percent to 12.5 percent in the upcoming budget and the next. It would go up again to 13.5 percent in fiscal year 2022 and finally to 15 percent by fiscal year 2023.\n\nCouncil Democrats: We need mix of budget cuts and Fischer's tax hike\n\nFrockt, Louisville's CFO, estimates it would increase the average Louisville family's home insurance by $12 to $13 per month by the time the tax hike is fully enacted. That's based on a $1,500 premium for a house worth anywhere from $125,000 to $300,000.\n\nSeveral members of Metro Council, which will ultimately decide whether to approve Fischer's tax hike, have suggested that they want a mix of cuts and new revenue.\n\nPrior to his call for the tax hike, Fischer released a plan for cuts, which includes reductions in public safety that the police chief said would be a \"slow train wreck\" for LMPD.\n\nWhen does Louisville have to decide?\n\nThe city faces a strict deadline to decide on the insurance premium tax hike.\n\nFor it to be enacted July 1, the start of the fiscal year, the Metro Council would have to pass the proposed ordinance at their March 21 council meeting, as the state's insurance department requires 100-day notice.\n\nThe Fischer administration first shared the tax hike plan on Feb. 13, leaving about five weeks for members to vet the plan or come up with alternatives.\n\nYou may like: Vote close on Louisville's insurance tax hike, but Fischer may have edge\n\nWho supports Louisville's tax hike? Who opposes it?\n\nMany council members are publicly undecided, as they discuss budget cuts they could stomach among themselves.\n\nA Courier Journal survey of the 26-member council shows nine Democrats either supporting or leaning toward supporting the tax hike. An equal number of council members, mostly Republicans, are opposed or leaning against a tax hike.\n\nThat leaves seven undecided council members and one \u2014 Brent Ackerson \u2014 who did not respond to repeated requests for comment. All are Democrats, as is Fischer, giving him what appears to be a party-line advantage.\n\nThese positions are subject to change, as negotiations in council continue, but all seven Republicans on council are likely to remain against the measure.\n\nOther opponents include Greater Louisville Inc., the city's chamber of commerce. Kent Oyler, the group's president and CEO, wrote that the insurance premium tax is an \"exceptionally terrible tax\" that would only be made worse under Fischer's plan.\n\n\"We should reject the notion that Louisville is left with only two extreme options to pay for pensions,\" Oyler wrote. \"There is a lot of room in the middle.\"\n\nMore: What could a Louisville tax hike on insurance premiums mean for you?\n\nRead this: Fischer's office to city agencies: Tax hike should be your 'No. 1 priority'\n\nWhat other revenue options did Mayor Fischer consider?\n\nFischer told reporters he considered about six revenue-generating options, evaluating their feasibility and effectiveness, before landing on the insurance premium tax.\n\nHis team ruled out options that required a state law change or a voter referendum to be enacted, as well as some that would be unpopular or raise too little revenue to make a difference.\n\nHere are some he weighed:\n\nA car rental fee of up to 3 percent that city officials said wouldn't raise enough money.\n\nA local franchise fee they say would be an unstable revenue source and wouldn't be levied on suburban cities.\n\nAn occupational license fee they feared would be unpopular because it's a tax on \"productivity.\"\n\nA restaurant tax that needs state approval.\n\nA taxing district that would be subject to a thumbs up from voters.\n\n\"When we went through the conversations with the council, they arrived at the same conclusion that we were at,\" Fischer said earlier this month. \"... When we took a look at the time required and the amount of money required, the consensus was the insurance premium tax.\"\n\nThere's a late push brewing in the state legislature to get a restaurant tax bill heard in committee and moving before time runs out. Some lobbyists, including Fischer's chief lobbyist, question whether there's time \u2014 or appetite among lawmakers \u2014 to consider the proposals.\n\nWhy is there a budget shortfall if there was just a surplus?\n\nIn December, Louisville Metro Council sent roughly a half-million dollars in surplus money to address the homeless crisis, as a \"bridge\" to a permanent solution.\n\nYou may like: A 'low-barrier' shelter could save the lives of Louisville's homeless\n\nHow was there surplus money, if the city now has a shortfall?\n\nFrockt says the budget surplus, which was roughly $600,000, came from fiscal year 2018, which ended on June 30.\n\nThat fiscal year, the city hadn't yet been tasked with paying more on their pension bill and also hadn't seen as much of a spike in health care costs. The surplus came from both the revenue and expense side of that year's budget, Frockt said.\n\nPlus, it's worth noting that $600,000 is a relatively small amount, both compared to the overall $750 million budget and the anticipated shortfalls of $35 million to $65 million, Frockt said.\n\nDarcy Costello: 502-582-4834; dcostello@courier-journal.com; Twitter: @dctello.

Louisville has a plan for that\n\nProviding trees to the public, training the community on implicit bias and creating a revised financial literacy curriculum for youths are all part of Louisville's first citywide Resilience Strategy, which was released Monday.\n\nThe Rockefeller Foundation selected Louisville in 2016 to be part of the initiative, which helps the city to develop strategies to survive future challenges. \"Resilience\" refers to the ability to survive or bounce back from disaster, a spokesman for the 100 Cities group previously said.\n\nMayor Greg Fischer said at a press conference Monday that resilience is essential in embracing future obstacles, such as climate change.\n\n\"We know we\u2019re going to face these tough challenges, so we\u2019ve got to be prepared,\" Fischer said.\n\nIn the 194-page report, the Louisville Metro Government outlined the work it has done since being selected for the 100 Resilient Cities initiative.\n\nBefore creating a strategy, the report states that metro government held an agenda-setting workshop with more than 200 people to discuss the topic of resilience and what it meant to Louisville. The core group identified compassion, trauma, equity, sustainability and economic opportunity as the core issues for Louisville's resilience.\n\nEric Friedlander, the city\u2019s first chief resilience officer, said that compassion, equity and trust serve as the guiding \"North Star\" for building resilience in Louisville.\n\n\"Everything in this plan needs to move us in that direction,\" Friedlander said.\n\nTo work toward addressing issues identified by the community, the report states four different visions: embracing lifelong learning, ensuring a safe and healthy city, building a vibrant economy and place and maximizing innovation and civic engagement.\n\nEach vision has various goals, and each goal has accompanying action items. For example, a goal under building a vibrant economy is increasing individual financial stability and opportunity for economic mobility, and an action item under that goal is to improve cost-of-living adjusted wages.\n\nFriedlander said the plan will be updated in the future.\n\nSoon, Louisville might be without the resources from 100 Resilient Cities. The organization announced in April that it is transforming and redistributing resources. Friedlander previously said said that 100 Resilient Cities told him it's committed to fully funding the rest of the resilience work, which is expected to run out in late July.

Fischer has said he will not veto the plan because the city needs the \"certainty\" of a budget, but still raised concerns.\n\n\"The numbers balance,\" he told the Courier Journal on Thursday, \"but the next question is what the human cost is.\"\n\nCouncilwoman Madonna Flood, D-24th District, was the sole vote against the budget. She said the citizens of Louisville deserved better, referencing the tax hike that she supported.\n\n\"I, in good conscience, cannot vote for something that puts the most vulnerable people in crisis situations,\" Flood said, to applause from people in the audience.\n\nCouncilman James Peden, R-23rd District, was not present for the vote.\n\nSee the list: Louisville Metro Council finalizes proposed budget and make cuts\n\nThe revised plan strips money from the Living Room, a diversion program to help people with mental illnesses or substance abuse problems, as well as much of the money Louisville has typically sent to nonprofits and the city's Cure Violence \"interrupter\" program, meant to curb violence by treating it like a disease.\n\nAdditionally, public safety is still getting hit, despite some council members' statements that the budget could be cut without hurting operations like police, fire and EMS.\n\nThe city is expected to lose a firehouse on Grade Lane by the airport that the union doubts will ever reopen and an ambulance from Louisville Metro EMS. The city also will likely see a net decrease in police officers on the street this time next year, thanks to a canceled recruit class and anticipated officer departures.\n\nAnd, importantly, the council's budget shifts operation of the city's youth detention center from Louisville Metro to the state, even though the state has said it cannot operate a detention center near Jefferson County.\n\nThat means Louisville youths facing charges, who are predominantly black, will likely be shipped to one of six other detention centers across the state, some of which are more than 100 miles away.\n\nSending those juveniles outside the county \u2013 and away from their support systems \u2013probably won't be a recipe for positive change, said Councilwoman Nicole George, D-21st District, who also voted for the tax hike and is a former social worker.\n\nWith children, positive behavior changes happen when \"we're able to capitalize on assets \u2014 and not pluck a kid up from their home and home life and move them out to another place and hope for the best,\" she said.\n\nCouncil members also stripped money from the \"interrupter\" program, to eliminate the three sites run by No More Red Dots and the YMCA, which came under scrutiny in recent months.\n\nPreviously: Violence 'interrupters' in spotlight as city pauses payments, hospital cuts ties\n\nCity officials including police Chief Steve Conrad had praised the model, which in Louisville was trained on hot spot neighborhoods including Russell, Shawnee and Portland, as a proactive way of stopping crime.\n\nRashaad Abdur-Rahman, the city official charged with overseeing the office that managed Cure Violence, wrote in a recent opinion piece that the \"interrupter\" intervention and prevention model is \"necessary to create the safe and healthy communities that we all deserve.\"\n\nAsked if the council's revised budget was equitable, Councilman Bill Hollander, a 9th District Democrat who also is the budget chairman, said: \"I think we had to make difficult choices.\"\n\nFischer: Budget changes 'may deepen inequities'\n\nThough Fischer indicated he wouldn't veto the budget ordinance, he did air some concerns with the Metro Council's changes in a statement after Tuesday night's vote.\n\nFor one, he said council members kept library hours the same by closing Youth Detention Services, \"before we can work out a solution with the state to keep our most vulnerable youth near their families and their schools.\"\n\nMoving operations to the state was an option in Fischer's original list of cuts in February as he campaigned for a tax hike. But he dropped it from his April budget proposal, largely because of \"concerns about the impact on children and equity challenges,\" a spokeswoman said.\n\n\"Nobody wants to be in the youth detention center. But the question is, if they are, how important is it for them to keep the connection to their families, their schools together?\" Fischer said in an interview Wednesday. \"The city decided a long time ago that's important.\"\n\nSaying he wants \"what's best for the kids and best for the families,\" Fischer said his team had been in talks with the state about transferring responsibility but wanted more time. His budget expected talks to continue through the end of the fiscal year in June 2020.\n\n'Recipe for disaster': Louisville nonprofits see city funding slashed in tight budget\n\nFischer also noted Tuesday night after the budget vote that the council funded the Middletown library and increased their own discretionary funds in part by making \"deep cuts\" to violence prevention efforts and by cutting offices that work to create economic development and to make government more efficient.\n\nFischer has said equity was a major factor in his budget proposal, which cut zero community centers, kept most Neighborhood Places running and proposed closing libraries near other branches.\n\n\"They were just moving small amounts of money here at the end,\" Fischer said Wednesday. \"When you put money in suburban street sweeping, suburban fire or Middletown library, you took it away from Safe & Healthy Neighborhoods. It made a difficult situation even worse.\"\n\nYouth detention center concerns\n\nHollander, the budget chair, said he's very concerned about the impact moving youth detention operations to the state will have on children, their parents, their grandparents and the community.\n\n\"On the other hand, it's a very, very expensive program run by the state in every other community in Kentucky,\" he said. \"And we are forced to pass a balanced budget with rapidly increasing pension costs.\"\n\nIt's true that Jefferson is the sole county in the state to operate its own youth detention center and that reimbursement payments from the state don't come close to covering the full cost.\n\nBut George, speaking to the Courier Journal last week, said there are things that make Jefferson County unique, adding that she's concerned about the effect of moving kids from their support systems, from cultural sensitivity and from educational and behavioral health service continuity.\n\nPreviously: Does Fischer want to raise Louisville property taxes? Here's what his budget says\n\nGeorge also questioned whether the city would end up paying a price later for not helping juveniles while they're children, when they're the most capable of change.\n\n\"Do we want to make those investments on the front end of life, or do we want to wait and try with adult jail?\" she said. \"If we don't ensure the youth have the best services now, are they going to cost us as adults down the road, in the way of detention?\"\n\n\"The real question to ask is ... where do we want to make our investments?\"\n\nThat's a sentiment shared by Winkler, who used the example of nonprofits not getting city funding and being squeezed by Metro United Way, as well.\n\n\"What happens to the at-risk youth who we're not intervening in today? Those at-risk 11-year-olds, 12-year-olds, 13-year-olds? When they're older, and they don't have positive change come into their life through some of these organizations?\"\n\nThe price of police, fire station losses\n\nAfter rejecting Fischer's proposed insurance premium tax hike, several council members were vocal proponents of the idea that savings could be found in the budget without taking away from critical public safety efforts.\n\nAnd while the council budget changes do send some additional money toward suburban fire and Louisville police, the goal of preserving all public safety dollars did not pan out.\n\n\"I personally didn't get everything I wanted in public safety, particularly with LMPD,\" said Councilman Anthony Piagentini, R-19th District. \"... This time next year, we will have less officers. And I do think that's a problem.\"\n\nPiagentini, who voted against the tax hike, said he plans to devote attention to the issue moving forward.\n\nThe council did send $50,000 to a recruit allowance fund, but Nicolai Jilek, the president of the union representing Louisville police officers, said Tuesday that anything shy of a \"significant investment to ensure the long-term ability of the city to provide adequate public safety, in my view, will be a failure.\"\n\nKentucky Derby guests: Louisville's budget crisis hasn't curbed Fischer's Derby guest spending. Should it?\n\nLosing police officers, as the department likely would under this budget, is an effect that will continue to impact the city for months and years to come, he said.\n\nFirefighters, too, have made their displeasure with the budget known.\n\n\"Will the loss of this fire station mean greater risk to the community? Of course,\" union president Brian O'Neill wrote in a letter to Metro Council members. \"Will the loss of this fire station equate to higher insurance rates, equaling or even surpassing the tax increase that Metro Council voted down? Absolutely.\"\n\nAnd, despite public scrutiny and questions around the program, supporters say ending the \"interrupter\" program could be a lasting detriment as well.\n\nAbdur-Rahman did not respond to Courier Journal requests for comment, but wrote in an opinion piece that the last year of the program, which was a pilot year, led to a decrease in homicides and shootings in the focus areas of the Cure Violence program.\n\n\"Let's reject the racist fearmongering about 'paying criminals' and continue to realistically invest in a public health strategy that implements proven initiatives,\" he wrote before the budget vote.\n\nThese cuts are \"to the muscle of the city,\" not just waste or fluff, Fischer said.\n\nCouncil members were not able to find spare money in the budget entirely without pain to the city, he said, so he hopes that they and residents understand Louisville needs investment.\n\n\"Hopefully the council, as we've gone through this budget process, understands the importance of investing for the future,\" Fischer said, \"and we'll get back on track here in these next several budgets.\"\n\nDarcy Costello: 502-582-4834; dcostello@courier-journal.com; Twitter: @dctello.

They also provide other environmental benefits, such as shade that reduces summer cooling costs and provides people relief from the sun.\n\n\u201cUsing an algorithm, they actually will be able to come up with a dollar amount of what those benefits are and what the value is for human health,\u201d Bays said.\n\nDougherty said that is valuable information that ACOG, his organization, state officials and other professionals can use.\n\nPlus, he and Bays noted the data also will help each involved entity plan for the future.\n\n\u201cWe will be able to use what we learned through the study to help plan future tree plantings for parks, school campuses and trails,\u201d Dougherty said, adding it also will provide valuable information to urban planners concerned about storm water issues and health care professionals.\n\n\u201cThere are going to be a lot of different people looking at the information, for different reasons.\"\n\n\u00a92019 The Oklahoman.

Swastikas were painted in blue on the glass doors to the building and on the sidewalk in front. The white-nationalist/neo-Nazi symbol \u201c1488,\u201d as well as anti-black and gay slurs, was found in bright-blue spray paint at many of the locations, including at McKinley Elementary School. At the Firehouse Art Center, a bust sculpture was defaced with the word \u201cJewess.\u201d Two swastikas were painted over the bust\u2019s eyes, and the forehead was marked with red paint running down, as if it had been shot in the head. A message in the art center\u2019s parking lot also expressed hate for German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The Chickasaw Nation\u2019s building was victim to messages like \u201cIndians will be gassed\u201d and \u201clampshaded.\u201d\n\nA note referred to as a \u201cmanifesto\u201d was found at the door of the state Democratic Party headquarters by a city councilwoman; it was turned it over to the police as evidence and not made public. The police have been investigating the incidents as hate crimes, and released a photo and video of a female suspect holding a can of spray paint who appeared to be walking away from one of the attacks. An image of her getting into a gray sedan in another location was also captured. The police asked the public for help in identifying the suspect.\n\nRoberta Clark, executive director of the Jewish Federation of Greater Oklahoma City, told JNS that the federation had made public statements about the graffiti on its Facebook page, noting that the organization was \u201cdeeply saddened, again, to learn of anti-Semitic and racist vandalisms in Norman,\u201d after making earlier statements condemning the graffiti in Oklahoma City.\n\nSubscribe to The JNS Daily Syndicate\n\nby email and never miss\n\nour top stories\n\n\u201cHateful rhetoric has no place in our community or country.

We hope the perpetrator/s of these hateful actions will be found and brought to justice soon,\u201d she told JNS via email.\n\nThe Chabad of Oklahoma City\u2019s Rabbi Ovadia Goldman told JNS that he was hesitant to make a public statement regarding the crimes because the perpetrator had not yet been caught, but he was willing to comment on the character of his hometown he\u2019s gleaned in the last two decades. \u201cFrom the elected officials to the police community to the general community, there has been nothing but love. My experience of 20 years in this community has been nothing but a loving, unified community.

He was also in Norman to help on April 3, telling local television reporters that the writing was clearly the work of the same hand. \u201cI know what hate feels like and this is hate,\u201d Enchassi told Fox25 News.\n\nPoliticians Respond\n\nLocal and statewide politicians universally condemned the graffiti and its xenophobic messages. \u201cOne bigot with a can of spray paint or even a group of bigots do not speak for the hundreds of thousands in this city who stand strongly together against hate and bigotry,\u201d wrote Mayor of Oklahoma City David Holt on his Facebook page.\n\nCongressman Tom Cole, a Republican congressman from Norman serving his ninth term, released a statement saying that he was \u201cincredibly disheartened\u201d with the \u201ccowardly and hateful\u201d defacement. \u201cSuch despicable and hate-filled language and symbols have no place in our communities, and I am especially horrified that one of these cases was present at an elementary school,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one, especially young and innocent children, should have to encounter such hate.\u201d\n\nDemocratic State Rep. Jacob Rosecrants spoke to JNS about growing up in Norman, Okla., as a Roman Catholic. \u201cFor the most part, Norman is a university community, very inclusive. Like in other parts of the Midwest, it\u2019s very Caucasian\u2014my district is 80 percent Caucasian. Maybe there\u2019s an underlying racism in more rural areas, a fear of outsiders or immigrants because people are afraid for their jobs, but it\u2019s never gotten loud like this in urban or suburban areas. I\u2019ve never seen anything like this in Norman. Anti-Semitism was literally never here before. I\u2019ve never seen it,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve tried to look very anti-Semitic, but it\u2019s also anti-immigrant. For whatever reason, hatred has really come out into the open since the election in 2016,\u201d added Rosecrants, who noted that he feels the hate is targeting institutions seen as Democratic. \u201cAs the country has voted more Democratic, Oklahoma has only gotten more Republican, and it will continue to do so as areas that have been traditionally Democratic strongholds move more to the right, I think, in response to national politics.\u201d\n\nFreshman Congresswoman Kendra Horn, who turned a red seat blue in Oklahoma City this past November, released a second public statement of concern, noting that the Norman vandalism seemed to indicate a recurring problem. \u201cI\u2019m heartbroken and troubled to see another display of hate and white supremacy in our state,\u201d Horn said in the statement. \u201cLaw enforcement is still investigating, but regardless of intent, subjecting Oklahomans, especially children, to these images is deeply damaging. This behavior empowers those who hold hate-filled beliefs.\u201d\n\nRepublican organizers also turned out to clean up the graffiti and made public statements condemning it. Oklahoma Republican Party chairman Pam Pollard tearfully shared thoughts with local media after viewing each racial slur written on the state Democratic Party\u2019s parking lot and building. \u201cThe Republican Party openly condemns, repudiates and thinks this is disgusting behavior. Disgusting, what is here, and it should never happen again,\u201d he said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter what races they\u2019re condemning; we are Americans and we stand for unification as Americans.\u201d\n\nVictoria Lupia, a member of the Oklahoma City\u2019s Jewish community, has lived in Oklahoma for more than 15 years, and explained that it has a Chabad House, as well as Conservative and Reform synagogues, as well as an active Hillel on campus at Norman\u2019s University of Oklahoma. The university houses the Schusterman Center for Judaic and Israel Studies, where students can major or minor in the subject.\n\n\u201cThese graffiti events seem to be the action of single angry individual, Lupia told JNS. \u201cEveryone is disgusted and disturbed by it, but overwhelmingly, everyone is disappointed that such an ugly thing would be perpetrated in our quiet backyard.\u201d", "title": "Oklahoma City reels from anti-Semitic, white-nationalist graffiti attacks", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Oklahoma City']"}, {"id": 367, "city": "['Oklahoma City']", "url": "https://oklahomawatch.org/2019/02/21/will-states-opportunity-zones-intended-for-the-poor-benefit-mostly-the-rich/", "text": "A new federal tax incentive to encourage long-term investments in low-income areas includes most of downtown Oklahoma City and Tulsa and other pockets of prosperity in the state, but excludes many areas that are impoverished.\n\nThe contrasts raise questions about how the areas, called \u201copportunity zones,\u201d were selected and whether the tax breaks will attract investments that mostly benefit extremely poor areas or ones where investments were already going.\n\nA review of an Oklahoma map with the zones brings home the point:\n\nOklahoma City opportunity zones cover much of Midtown and most of downtown. They take in the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center complex but miss some of the low-income, predominantly black neighborhoods adjacent to it. The northeast-side zones include the Northeast 23rd Street corridor, which the city has long targeted for increased investment, Martin Luther King Avenue and the I-35 corridor. A zone does include a troubled industrial and low-income stretch on the west side between I-35 and 10th Street.\n\nAnother zone abuts high-income Nichols Hills and includes the Chesapeake Energy campus, although it also extends into industrial and residential areas off Lincoln Boulevard. Little of the south side of Oklahoma City is included, except the former Crossroads Mall area. (Santa Fe South charter school occupies the former mall.) The Capitol Hill area is ignored.\n\nOklahoma has 117 Opportunity Zones, which are comprised of individual Census tracts. The zones cover rural and urban areas and align in many places with tribal land.\n\nIn Tulsa, chunks of the historically black north side were left out, although the downtown zone and Tulsa International Airport areas include some surrounding neighborhoods. Tulsa\u2019s other zones include the industrial west side of the Arkansas River, Sand Springs, the University of Tulsa area and a single tract around Broken Arrow\u2019s entertainment and shopping \u201cRose District.\u201d\n\nGoogle\u2019s data center, which is being expanded again, is in an opportunity zone in the MidAmerica Industrial Park south of Pryor. It\u2019s the only zone in Mayes County, which has five other low-income census tracts that didn\u2019t make the state\u2019s cut. Most of McCurtain County, in far southeastern Oklahoma, is an opportunity zone. That area has long struggled with poverty, but also encompasses holdings of timber giant Weyerhaeuser.\n\nThirty Oklahoma counties do not have any opportunity zones. Oklahoma and Tulsa counties each have 21.\n\nWhat They Are\n\nOpportunity zones, which were part of a package of tax cuts Congress passed in late 2017, allow investors to reduce or eliminate federal capital gains taxes.\n\nThe investors can be individuals, companies or funds set up specifically to invest in the zones. There are no caps on the incentive, although investment must go into low-income census tracts selected by governors in each state. The law allowed states to designate up to one-fourth of their low-income census tracts as opportunity zones. For Oklahoma, that means 117 of the state\u2019s 465 eligible low-income tracts. Nationwide, 8,764 zones were designated as opportunity zones.\n\nMap of Oklahoma Opportunity Zones\n\nClick on layers symbol at top; selected Federal OZ Tracts\n\nState and city leaders are touting the opportunity zones in meetings and online. Investment seminars are being organized on the coasts to attract high-net-worth individuals. Officials say the program is a prime opportunity to accelerate investment that benefits both specific areas and broader surrounding ones. One analysis shows $6.1 trillion in unrealized capital gains are on the books of corporations and individuals.\n\n\u201cEven a small fraction of these gains reinvested into opportunity zones would constitute the largest economic development initiative in the country,\u201d John Lettieri, co-founder of the Economic Innovation Group, told Congress in a hearing last year.\n\nOthers are skeptical. They question whether the program will live up to its purpose, saying the investments could increase gentrification in urban areas and displace poorer residents. They also worry much of the money will go INTO big-ticket urban real estate deals that already made financial sense.\n\n\u201cThe fundamental problem with opportunity zones is the disconnect between the size of the potential tax costs, which are uncapped, and the social benefits from the investments, which will be hard to measure,\u201d said Steven M. Rosenthal, a senior fellow in the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute.\n\nOklahoma City has 21 Opportunity Zones. They are comprised of individual Census tracts. The city\u2019s zones include much of the thriving downtown area, as well as the OU Health Sciences Center complex and the Chesapeake Energy campus.\n\nDowntown Oklahoma City has seen hundreds of millions in public and private investment in the past several decades. In the seven tracts that make up much of downtown, the Census Bureau estimates their total population at just 3,800 people, although hundreds of new apartments have been built in the past several years. The tract covering Chesapeake has roughly 2,300 residents.\n\nTo designate the low-income tracts, the federal tax law said states must use five-year population estimates from the Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey for 2011-2015.\n\nThe only businesses that don\u2019t qualify to participate are gambling establishments, country clubs, golf courses, massage parlors and liquor/beer stores. Theoretically, an energy company could invest in oil and gas or renewable energy projects located in an opportunity zone. Investors or companies also could target specific industries, like aerospace, or community needs like affordable housing.\n\nHow They Were Chosen\n\nThe zones were announced with little fanfare and no insight into the criteria used to select them. The tax law gave states\u2019 governors complete autonomy, as long as they met certain income or poverty requirements. Oklahoma had 90 days to select the opportunity zone tracts last year. Through the Oklahoma Department of Commerce, Fallin\u2019s office consulted with chambers of commerce, tribal leaders and economic development officials to make the designations, said Leslie Blair, a spokeswoman for the Commerce Department.\n\nAt least 34 states had some type of public input on the designations of opportunity zones, according to the Economic Innovation Group, which helped develop the policy and is monitoring its implementation. Both California and Colorado published draft maps of zones, which were then refined with public input. Oklahoma did not hold any public meetings because they weren\u2019t required, Blair said.\n\nIn addition, governors were allowed to designate a small number of tracts next to low-income tracts. But those tracts must have median family incomes that don\u2019t exceed 125 percent of the median in the adjacent low-income tracts. No more than 5 percent of a state\u2019s opportunity zones can have that contiguous designation.\n\nGov. Kevin Stitt, Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt and Tulsa Mayor G.T. Bynum have all touted the potential of opportunity zones to attract new investment to the state.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be a tremendous opportunity for Oklahoma to recruit businesses to our state,\u201d Stitt said at a Jan. 17 press conference. He designated Lt. Gov. Matt Pinnell as his administration\u2019s point man on development of the zones. Pinnell plans a series of summits in the coming months to promote the zones in rural areas.\n\nDavid Holt, who took office in April, said the zones were designated before he took office and the state led much of the process. Overall, he\u2019s happy with the 21 zones in Oklahoma City, although he wishes the Capitol Hill area in southwest Oklahoma City had been included.\n\n\u201cThe opportunity zones downtown and in the Innovation District (east of downtown) are obviously low-hanging fruit and probably sell themselves to some extent, but we would really feel disappointed in the end if we weren\u2019t able to leverage them to get more investment in Northeast 23rd or Crossroads Mall or Northwest 10th, some of those more challenged areas that are also a part of the opportunity zones,\u201d Holt said\n\nMarketing the Zones\n\nWith the zones designated, state and city officials are in marketing mode. Oklahoma City is partnering with a nonprofit, Accelerator for America, to come up with a prospectus for investors. The city\u2019s opportunity-zone effort is coordinated by the Alliance for Economic Development, which contracts with the city for economic development.\n\nTulsa has 21 Opportunity Zones. The zones, which are comprised of individual census tracts, include the city\u2019s downtown and Tulsa International Airport as well as the industrial west side of the Arkansas River. Credit: Oklahoma Department of Commerce\n\n\u201cWe took a look at all of the eligible tracts and then from there tried to figure out the areas of this city where there was a planned public investment for now or in the near future that could potentially spur additional private investment,\u201d said Kian Kamas, Tulsa\u2019s chief of economic development.\n\nFor example, Tulsa picked census tracts along a new bus rapid transit route that extends to North Tulsa with a plan to attract a major employer to the area. The View is one of the city\u2019s first housing developments to take advantage of the incentive and has designated 20 percent of its units for affordable housing, Kamas said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re still very much distressed areas where there\u2019s a lot of work to do, but we knew that we already had strategies in place that would allow the city to make public investments or where we knew there were already planned philanthropic investments that could really help encourage and maybe reduce the risk or perceived risk of a private investor,\u201d Kamas said.\n\nThe Commerce Department is contacting city and counties with opportunity zones to see what kind of investments could be marketed to investors, said Jon Chiappe, director of research and economic analysis. It also plans to reach out to qualified opportunity funds, which allow investors to pool their money in funds that invest in the zones.\n\n\u201cIf we can highlight some of these opportunities to investors outside the state, then we can potentially attract capital to this state for development,\u201d Chiappe said. \u201cIn Duncan, it might be an industrial park. In Bartlesville, it might be affordable housing and whatever\u2019s important to that community.\u201d\n\nThe agency is also trying to track investments to see if the opportunity zone designation had a positive effect on poverty and employment. The incentive is more beneficial the longer an investor has money in a project or fund, so gathering that data will take time. In a joint letter to the IRS, Oklahoma and 11 other states urged federal officials to require opportunity funds to report where they\u2019ve invested in opportunity zones, the amount of capital deployed and the appreciation of that capital.\n\nCurrently, there is no public reporting requirement.\n\nReach reporter Paul Monies at (571) 319-3289 or pmonies@oklahomawatch.org.", "title": "Will State\u2019s \u2018Opportunity Zones\u2019, Intended for the Poor, Benefit Mostly the Rich?", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Oklahoma City']"}, {"id": 368, "city": "['New York']", "url": "https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/nyc-among-smoggiest-cities-nation-report-says", "text": "NEW YORK \u2013 New Yorkers are breathing some pretty grimy air, according to a report which is likely not going to shock too many city dwellers. Every borough except for Brooklyn recorded a grade F from researchers from the American Lung Association for smog levels.\n\nAnd before Brooklynites throw open their windows to celebrate with lungs full of fresh air, they only escaped getting an F because no monitoring data was available.\n\nThe association found that more than 40 percent of Americans live in areas with unhealthy air. New York ranked tenth worst in the country for smog levels.\n\nThere was some good news: when researchers looked at particle pollution, which comes from sources including wildfires, wood-burning devices, coal plants and diesel engines \u2014 New York City's air was clean. Every county got a grade A.\n\nBut the poor marks came for ozone pollution, or smog. Ozone is produced when pollutants react to sunlight. \"Increased heat in 2017 likely drove this increase in ozone,\" the report said.\n\n\"Warmer temperatures stimulate the reactions in the atmosphere that cause ozone to form, and 2017 saw the second warmest temperatures on record in the United States,\" the report says. \"All three years covered in this report rank as the three warmest years ever recorded.\"\n\nHarold Wimmer, the group's president and CEO, said that after years of progress, there's clear evidence of a \"disturbing trend,\" with many Americans seeing their air quality worsening due to wildfires and weather patterns. Climate change is fueling that trend, he said.\n\n\"This increase in unhealthy air is eye-opening, and points to the reality that the nation must do more to protect the public from serious, even life-threatening harm,\" Wimmer said in a news release. \"There is no clearer sign that we are facing new challenges than air pollution levels that have broken records tracked for the past twenty years, and the fact that we had more days than ever before when monitored air quality reached hazardous levels for anyone to breathe.\"\n\nThe American Lung Association, whose work involves improving lung health and preventing lung disease, looked at ozone and particle pollution, often called soot, in its 20th annual \"State of the Air\" report. Nationwide, more than 141 million people lived in areas last year with unsafe levels of the two, the report found. That's an increase of more than 7 million from 2017.\n\nThe report said each county had several Orange days, which means the air quality was bad enough to be deemed unhealthy to people with sensitive health conditions.\n\nThe report looked at three years of data on the two most widespread outdoor air pollutants from 2015-17, which were the warmest years in recorded history.\n\nFor the study, researchers with the Lung Association measured particle pollution in both short- and long-term intervals. Short-term refers to daily spikes that can prove deadly, while long-term refers to yearly average.\n\nCalifornia, which has been devastated by wildfires in recent years, is home to four of the 10 cities most polluted by short-term particle pollution, and six of the 10 most polluted year-round. Furthermore, the Golden State is home to seven of the 10 most ozone-polluted cities.\n\nOzone pollution, often called smog, is unhealthy and essentially leaves a sunburn on the lungs, the report said. Breathing in ozone can leave people suffering from shortness of breath and cause bouts of coughing, asthma attacks and even early death.\n\nLos Angeles remained the city with the worst ozone for the 19th time in the report's 20-year history.

In that period, LA County averaged 119 days per year during which ozone, or smog, was at unhealthy levels. In last year\u2019s report, the county averaged 111 unhealthy days.\n\nAir quality was actually worse in San Bernardino and Riverside counties, which are lumped in with Los Angeles for the study\u2019s city rankings. Those counties averaged 161 and 130 ozone days, respectively.\n\nThe negative effects of smog go beyond obscuring views from the Griffith Observatory. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, ozone can cause permanent lung damage, make asthma attacks more likely, and can even heighten the risk of early death for those exposed to high levels.\n\nThe LA area fared slightly better when it came to particle pollution, which can be aggravated by a range of sources\u2014from diesel engines to vacuum cleaners. In terms of short-term particle pollution, when the level of harmful particulate matter in the air spikes for a brief time period, Los Angeles ranked seventh among cities affected by these temporary hazards.\n\nLonger term levels of particle pollution in Los Angeles were high enough to place the city fifth on that list. It was one of six urban areas in California to rank among the top ten.\n\nParticle pollution, which can trigger heart attacks, strokes, and asthma attacks, can be especially exacerbated by wildfires, which have plagued California in recent years.\n\nIn the Los Angeles area, fires caused air quality levels in some parts of the region to twice hit \u201cmaroon,\u201d the most severe level on the EPA\u2019s Air Quality Index.

Both types of pollution can increase the risk of premature death and other health effects such as lung cancer, asthma attacks, cardiovascular damage and developmental and reproductive harm, according to the report.\n\nIn terms of ozone pollution, the report measures ground-level ozone, which is created by chemical reactions from pollutants emitted by sources such as cars, power plants, boilers and refineries.\n\n\u201cWhen older adults or children with asthma breathe ozone-polluted air, too often they end up in the doctor\u2019s office, the hospital or the emergency room,\u201d Tin said in a statement. \u201cOzone can even shorten life itself.\u201d\n\nThe report shows how warmer temperatures influenced by climate change make ozone more likely to form and harder to clean up.\n\nDespite the jump in unhealthy ozone days in Chicago and other cities, ozone pollution has decreased nationwide over the past decade in large part due to reductions in major sources of emissions, especially from coal-fired power plants and vehicles.\n\nThe new report does include a bright spot for Chicago specifically. From 2015-17, the city recorded its lowest levels in the study\u2019s 20-year history for both year-round and short-term particle pollution, which is made of tiny particles (soot) that come from sources such as diesel emissions, wildfires and wood-burning devices. The particles can lodge deep in the lungs and trigger asthma attacks, heart attacks and strokes, according to ALA.\n\nThis year\u2019s report found that Chicago had a yearly average of just 1.2 unhealthy air quality days in terms of particle pollution.\n\nAlthough the study provides a big-picture look at Chicago\u2019s air quality, there is not enough data to evaluate short-term effects of pollution in the city, according to the report.\n\nEstimates show that more than 640,000 adults and 130,000 children in the Chicago area suffer from asthma. More than 510,000 adults in the area have been diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, also known as COPD, estimates show.\n\nNationwide, the ALA found that four in 10 Americans now live in areas with unhealthy air.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re heading in the wrong direction when it comes to protecting public health,\u201d Tin said in a statement.\n\nReal the ALA's full 2019 \"State of the Air\" report here.\n\nContact Alex Ruppenthal: @arupp | [email protected] | (773) 509-5623\n\nRelated stories:\n\nChicago Adopts Stricter Rules for Manganese, Other Pollutants\n\nVW Settlement: Illinois Awards $19M for Cleaner Bus and Train Engines\n\nThanks to our sponsors: View all sponsors", "title": "Chicago Among the Country\u2019s Most Polluted Cities, Study Finds", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "['air_quality']", "annot_city": "['Chicago']"}, {"id": 371, "city": "['Houston']", "url": "https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Despite-progress-Houston-air-quality-among-worst-13791574.php", "text": "Despite improvements, Houston made the top 10 list for most polluted cities in the country for ozone, according to the new \u201cState of the Air\u201d report.\n\nHouston ranked 9 for ozone pollution based on a higher average of unhealthy air days from 2015 to 2017, up two places from last year\u2019s report. For particle pollution, it ranked 17, down from 15. The American Lung Association\u2019s 20th annual report based its rankings on unhealthy air days as recorded using the Air Quality Index. It looks at annual and short term spikes in particle pollution levels.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m surprised and disturbed that Houston\u2019s air quality worsened in this year\u2019s report,\u201d said Luke Metzger, director of Environment Texas. \u201cThe trend since 1999 had been one of steady progress and instead now it seems we are backtracking and that\u2019s bad news particularly for the hundreds of thousands of people who have asthma or other vulnerable populations like senior citizens.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cState of the Air\u201d is a report card on the two most widespread outdoor air pollutants, ozone pollution or smog, and particle pollution also called soot that is so small that it can lodge deep in the lungs.\n\nBoth ozone and particle pollution are dangerous to public health and can increase the risk of premature death and other serious health effects such as lung cancer, asthma attacks, cardiovascular damage, and developmental and reproductive harm, the association warns.\n\nOnline: To sign up for ozone action day email city alerts and air quality forecasts: https://www.houstontx.gov/health/Environmental/bpcp/outdoor_air.html\n\nRead More\n\nThe worst period on record for ozone in Houston was from 1997 to 1999 when there was a weighted average of 110 days of unhealthy air, said JoAnne Strother, director of advocacy for the American Lung Association in Texas. Compared to this year average of 26.7 days, it paints a good picture, she said. \u201cYes, maybe it still ranked fairly high, but comparing Houston from 1997-1999 to now, the air quality has improved.\u201d\n\nWhile Houston no longer tops the list for the most polluted, Metzger said the progress that helped improve air quality back in the late 1990s has stalled.\n\n\u201cThere are still are some initiatives, but the momentum has declined,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are not seeing the same level of support from our state leaders, making this a priority and implementing policies necessary to clean up the air.\u201d\n\nThe latest numbers, he said, show the problem hasn\u2019t gone away.\n\nTexas had three of the top 25 most polluted cities \u2014 Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth and El Paso \u2014 although it still lags behind California, which had 10 of the most polluted cities.\n\nNationwide, more than four in 10 Americans, about 43.3 percent of the population, live in counties that have monitored unhealthy ozone and/or particle pollution, the report found. And nearly 141.1 million people are exposed to unhealthy air, an increase from the previous two reports but still down from the 166 million in the years covered in the 2016 report (2012-2104).\n\nA big contributor to air quality, according to the report, is climate change as warmer temperatures stimulate the reactions in the atmosphere that cause ozone to form. The reporting years, 2015-2017, are also the three warmest years recorded in global history, the authors said.\n\nLoren Raun, the city\u2019s chief environmental science officer, was not surprised by the high ranking, she said, \u201cit\u2019s a very big problem we got to continue to work on and be ware that it\u2019s affecting people.\u201d\n\nHer office is improving its monitoring of air pollution and sends out alerts when especially vulnerable populations and those who suffer from asthma who may be affected.\n\nUsing 911 data for ambulance-treated asthma attacks, Raun\u2019s office analyzed how air pollution is associated with asthma attacks, she said. Levels don\u2019t have to reach an \u201cozone action day\u201d for people who, for instance suffer from asthma, to be impacted, she said. Multiple days of unhealthy air and the different pollutants might be enough for them to take precautionary measures.\n\nAir pollution is a big burden to the city, she said.\n\n\u201cWe have 6,000 children in HISD (Houston Independent School District) who have asthma,\u201d she said, \u201cIt\u2019s the biggest chronic disease problem they face.\u201d\n\nWhich is a concern, she added, because if children are impacted and their asthma isn\u2019t in control, they aren\u2019t in school, which means they can\u2019t excel and learn. \u201cEverything that pollution affects is a cost to society.\u201d\n\nCurrent models estimate that more than 60 percent of ozone pollution is from cars, according to Raun, and to address that, the city is trying to encourage practices such as the use of mass transit and transitioning to fuel-efficient or low-emission vehicles.\n\n\u201cIf we could do that, we could come a long way to improving our air quality,\u201d she said, as well as \u201ccontinue to work on getting industries to meet permit requirements and support TCEQ (Texas Commission on Environmental Quality) in enforcing permitting requirements.\u201d\n\nThe latest numbers demonstrate air pollution is getting better, Strother said, but more needs to be done. \u201cIt\u2019s important that we call on the current administration and Congress to adopt science-based solutions to reduce emissions that are causing climate change and to ensure no community near a polluting source is left behind.\u201d\n\nperla.trezino@chron.com", "title": "Despite progress, Houston air quality among worst in the nation, study finds", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "['air_quality']", "annot_city": "['Houston']"}, {"id": 372, "city": "['Phoenix']", "url": "https://ktar.com/story/2544591/annual-study-finds-that-phoenixs-air-quality-is-deteriorating/", "text": "PHOENIX \u2014 Metro Phoenix\u2019s air quality greatly deteriorated over the past year, according to a new study.\n\nArizona\u2019s capital city ranks seventh for dirtiest air among American cities when it comes to ozone, according to the American Lung Association\u2019s annual State of the Air report for 2018, which was released Tuesday.\n\n\u201cWe were ranked eighth last year, so we did have more days where the air quality was bad,\u201d said JoAnna Strother, director of advocacy for the American Lung Association of Arizona.\n\nFrom 2017 to 2018, Phoenix moved from 20th to 13th nationwide for 24-hour particle pollution and from 50th to 32nd for year-round particle pollution.\n\nStrother said some of the blame goes to extra smoke and particles from last summer\u2019s California wildfires that lingered in Phoenix\u2019s heat.\n\n\u201cWe have sunshine most of the year,\u201d she said. \u201cIt gives us the perfect recipe to cook up ozone.

Aired: April 25, 2019 | Transcript\n\nCalifornia cities claimed seven of the top 10 spots in the American Lung Association\u2019s State of the Air report.\n\nSan Diego is the sixth smoggiest city.\n\nAmerican Lung Association officials said local air quality has been declining in the past five years. The Association\u2019s Deborah Kelly says the number of smoggy days in San Diego is up 42% over the past five years.\n\nThe number of unhealthy ozone days in 2014 was 26. That number climbed to 45 this year.\n\nThe increase comes after the number of high ozone days steadily fell for 15 years.\n\nLung Association officials said climate change makes things worse. The nearly three years of data covered in the report came during some of the hottest temperatures in global history.\n\n\u201cThe hotter it is, the more ozone is made, the faster it is made. The worse our air quality gets and of course, the impacts of climate change just get that much worse,\u201d said Debra Kelley, of the American Lung Association in California, San Diego.\n\nLos Angeles, Visalia and Bakersfield are the top three cities. Fresno at 4, Sacramento at 5 and San Jose at 8 are the other California cities that made the list.\n\nPhoenix at No. 7, Houston at No. 9 and New York at No. 10 rounded out the smoggy list.\n\nSmog is created when carbon emissions, typically from cars and trucks, is mixed with nitrogen oxides and is then heated by the sun. The pollution can make it hard to breathe and damages the lungs.\n\nTougher pollution rules can help and preserve California\u2019s right to set stronger pollution standards for cars is key.\n\n\u201cThose tailpipe emission standards, which are making a bad situation, less bad, are under assault from the federal government and Donald Trump. We currently are in litigation. If we lose that litigation, we are talking about 100s of millions of cubic tons of new pollution that will enter California. We have to stop the damage and stop the bleeding and then we have to take decisive action to make it better,\u201d said Nathan Fletcher, San Diego County supervisor and member of the State Air Resources Board.\n\nEl Centro also got some negative attention in the report. The Imperial County city is the nation\u2019s eighth worst city for year-round particle pollution, which can cause a number of health problems like asthma.\n\nSign up for Today's Top Stories newsletter Need help keeping up with the news that matters most?

In this year\u2019s report, the area dropped to 17th on the list of most-polluted cities, one spot better than in the 2018 report.\n\nAt No. 9, Houston was the only Texas city to rank higher on the \"most-polluted\" list, according to the report.\n\nThe top three cities on the list are in California. The Los Angeles-Long Beach area took the top spot, followed by Visalia and Bakersfield.\n\nNorth Texas suffered through fewer days with unhealthy levels of ozone and lower year-round particle pollution, according to the report.\n\nFor the recorded period, the area had no days when short-term particle pollution \u2014 days when smog levels spike \u2014 climbed to unhealthy levels. That made Dallas-Fort Worth one of the cleanest areas for short-term particle pollution, the report found.\n\nNEW: The number of Americans living in counties with unhealthy air increased to more than 141 million\u2014 7.2 million more Americans than in last year\u2019s report.

The figure includes people with asthma, lung disease or lung cancer, heart disease and diabetes, as well as those living in poverty, children and adults older than 65.\n\nOzone is an odorless gas, usually present in the upper levels of the atmosphere, where it protects the earth from the sun\u2019s ultraviolet rays. When ozone reaches ground level, it becomes the main ingredient in smog and can be harmful and create respiratory issues for some. For the number of high ozone days, the area received an \u201cF\u201d on the annual report card.\n\nParticle-pollution \u2014 soot or tiny particles in the air \u2014 can come from several sources, including coal-fired power plants, diesel emissions, wildfires and wood-burning devices, Strother said.\n\nStrother credited any improvements in air quality to the cleanup of coal-fired power plants and companies that have put \u201cold, dirty\u201d diesel engines out of use.\n\nRising temperatures, however, present another challenge. The report found that warmer temperatures help ozone form, saying that rising average annual temperatures will make matters worse in coming years.\n\nSo far this year for Dallas-Fort Worth, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality has issued only two ozone action days, when air quality levels could be unhealthy for sensitive groups.\n\nAs summer nears and temperatures rise, however, KXAS-TV (NBC5) meteorologist Samantha Davies warned that the area will likely see more ozone action days.\n\nOn those days, the TCEQ recommends limiting time outdoors, carpooling and shortening driving times when possible.", "title": "Air quality improves in Dallas-Fort Worth, but it\u2019s still among most-polluted U.S. cities, report finds", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "['air_quality']", "annot_city": "['Dallas']"}, {"id": 377, "city": "['San Jose']", "url": "https://www.sanjoseinside.com/news/silicon-valley-schools-shut-down-due-to-air-quality-concerns/", "text": "This week\u2019s unhealthy air quality\u2014caused by the ongoing Camp Fire, the deadliest, most destructive blaze in state history\u2014has prompted some schools and most colleges in the South Bay to temporarily shut down.

A spokesman for the California Department of Education (CDE) called the wave of wildfire-prompted cancelations one of the state\u2019s largest ever.\n\nLocally, San Jose State University was one of the first to call off classes Thursday and plans to do the same through Saturday. Several local private prep schools, universities and community colleges will close their doors for the rest of the week as well. Santa Clara University plans to go dark through Sunday.\n\nThe Foothill-De Anza Community College District canceled classes at both campuses. As did the San Jose-Evergreen Community College District. Presentation High, a private all-girls parochial school, told students to stay home Friday.\n\nThe Santa Clara County Office of Education (SCCOE), on the other hand, is urging public K-12 schools to remain open. SCCOE Superintendent Mary Ann Dewan sent out an advisory, saying that after consulting with public health officials, she decided that it would be best for schools to continue as scheduled Friday but to limit outdoor activity.\n\n\u201cIt is my goal to keep students in schools when possible, as schools provide a safe environment,\u201d Dewan said. \u201cOur goal is to ensure student safety.\u201d\n\nThe San Jose Unified, the largest public school district in the South Bay, will heed her advice and continue sessions on Friday. It appears that most of the 31 local school districts will follow suit, a trend that drew some backlash online.\n\nParents responded to many of the announcements on school district Facebook pages by questioning the decision to stay open when so many other campuses\u2014include the all 18 in the Contra Costa Unified School District up in the East Bay\u2014planned to call off classes in response to air quality that became increasingly hazardous as the week went on.\n\n\u201cIf colleges feel the need to shut down why are our kids still being required to attend and absences for their health are unexcused,\u201d one parents wrote on a Facebook thread about South Bay public schools being notably absent from the list of closures.\n\nSeveral people on social media connected the decision to the public K-12 system\u2019s attendance-based funding formula. \u201cBecause the public schools only receive their per-diem per student if the students attend,\u201d someone responded. \u201cClearly the money they get is more important than the safety of the students. It\u2019s very sad because many of these children bike and walk to school each day.\u201d\n\nOthers applauded the decision because many families lack the resources to find someone to watch their kids on a work day. And because for many low-income households, schools are the safest place to send their children.\n\nThough the state bases funding on average daily attendance, it should be noted that the CDE grants waivers for safety and health-related closures.\n\nOther parents supported the SCCOE\u2019s guidance because closures would burden many families, especially those that lack the resources to find someone to watch their kids on a work day. And because for many low-income, under-resourced households, schools are a reliable place to feed their children and a safe place to send them during the day.\n\n\"This afternoon, the index was 182 in San Jose, 186 in San Rafael and 217 in Oakland; these readings are in the \"unhealthy\" range. \"Good\" air quality falls in the 0 to 50 range.\" https://t.co/HZXBnka7NB \u2014 kiersten (@kierstennamber) November 15, 2018\n\nThe Santa Clara County Department of Public Health issued an advisory of its own, directing people to stay inside and avoid exposure until the smoke subsides.\n\nOn Thursday, the regional average Air Quality Index was 194\u2014the equivalent of smoking several cigarettes. Parts of the South Bay surpassed 200, which is considered \u201cvery unhealthy.\u201d The latest air quality readings are available online here.\n\nThe Bay Area Air Quality Management District has deemed every day through next week a spare-the-air day, which means it\u2019s illegal to burn wood, because of particulate levels deemed very unhealthy.

Last year, Austin had 10 days of air quality deemed unhealthy for sensitive groups, which follows closely on the heels of 2015\u2019s 12 days of bad air quality.\n\nAir quality is determined to be \u201cbad\u201d if any pollutant rises above the predetermined compliance levels set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Standards implemented by the EPA in 2015 state that good air quality permits 55 parts per billion of all air pollutants. Bad air quality is determined if the air has 71-85 parts per billion of all air pollutants.\n\n\u201cGround-level ozone is like a sunburn for your lungs,\u201d Phoebe Romero with the Office of Sustainability told the Environmental Commission at its June 5 meeting. Risk of exposure to bad ozone is elevated in the summertime months because more people are outside and temperatures are hotter.\n\nHigh temperatures and blazing sunshine contribute to worsened air quality by magnifying the greenhouse effect that traps and radiates heat within the atmosphere.\n\nAustin is the largest city that is in compliance with all of the required atmospheric levels mandated by the EPA\u2019s established National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Yet the city is on the cusp of being out of compliance in 2019, Andrew Hoekzema with the Capital Area Council of Governments told the Environmental Commission. Last year, he said, \u201cWe managed to remain in compliance just barely.\u201d\n\nSo far in 2019, there have been no days that have reached unhealthy levels of air quality. Seventeen days were considered \u201cmoderate\u201d in terms of air quality. However, Hoekzema told the commissioners it is still too early to determine if this year will have fewer bad air quality days than last year. August and September, he explained, are the worst days of the year for ozone, and there is a risk of bad ozone up through the end of October.\n\nIf this year\u2019s air quality is any worse than last year\u2019s, Hoekzema says the city will be in violation of national air quality standards. If that happens, there can be consequences even beyond public health.\n\nHoekzema told the Austin Monitor in an email, \u201cIf EPA designates an area as \u2018nonattainment,\u2019 new permitting requirements and restrictions on construction and expansion of large point sources of emissions (factories, power plants) would take effect. Also, there would be new restrictions and requirements on federal approvals of transportation plans and funding and other types of projects (like approving rail projects or airport expansions). Some of these restrictions can continue to apply for at least 20 years even after the area is able to bring its air pollution back into attainment of the standards due to \u2018maintenance\u2019 requirements in the Clean Air Act.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think the average person in Austin knows zero about what is going on,\u201d Commissioner Mary Ann Neely said.\n\nRomero noted that outreach is of primary importance as the city works toward the goals of Net Zero Community GHG Emissions and 65 percent renewable energy by 2027. Neely told commissioners that those who live in Austin are the ones who will make the difference by taking everyday steps to lower their own emissions by driving less and using fossil fuel-powered appliances sparingly.\n\nChair Linda Guerrero pointed out that there are also steps that the city can take to limit emissions by creating ordinances that allow for enforceable limits on building sites. \u201cBecause right now, we have nothing,\u201d she said.\n\nPhoto by the National Archives at College Park [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons.\n\nThe Austin Monitor\u2019s work is made possible by donations from the community.

A report released Wednesday, though, found more than 270 harmful contaminants in local drinking water across the nation, including in Miami-Dade County. The substances are linked to cancer, damage to the brain and nervous system, hormonal disruption, problems in pregnancy and other serious health conditions.\n\nThe nonprofit Environmental Working Group, collaborating with outside scientists, aggregated and analyzed data from almost 50,000 local water utilities in all 50 states.\n\nThe organization found a troubling discrepancy between the current legal limits for contaminants and the most recent authoritative studies of what is safe to consume.\n\nIn Miami-Dade, the group found 21 contaminants across our water supply between 2012 and 2017.\n\n\"A lot of these legal limits are outdated and not necessarily the safe level, and the EWG really wants to fill that gap,\" Evans said. \"The federal government has not been able to, or is not willing to, set those new regulations to protect public health. We're trying to fill the gap to let people know, based on the latest science, what the safe levels of contaminants in water are.\"\n\nMiami-Dade Water and Sewer Authority serves 2.3 million people, according to the agency's Jennifer L. Messemer-Skold, who said Miami-Dade water meets all federal, state and local drinking water standards.\n\n\"The federal Safe Drinking Water Act provides a national process and framework for determining drinking water standards to insure the safety of drinking water,\" she explained. \"The process for establishing standards based upon scientifically verified health affects data and measurement techniques is overseen by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. \"\n\n\"States may establish more stringent standards if they chose to do so,\" she said. \"Organizations and individuals may have different opinions regarding the adequacy of federal and state drinking water standards and the associated margins of safety that are included in those standards and their recommended alternatives may not include the economic and technical feasibility of treating large volumes of water to the standards they are advocating.\"\n\nShe said drinking water standards are developed with the most vulnerable people of the population in mind.\n\nMessemer-Skold told Patch the agency will continue to provide \"affordable water\" to its customers. She said county water officials will continue to meet all standards set by the state of Florida as well as federal agencies charged with the responsibility of protecting public health.\n\nThe following contaminants were detected above the environmental group's own recommended health guidelines in the Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Authority:\n\nArsenic (Name of contaminant)\n\nCancer (Potential Effect)\n\n292 (Times the rate of suggested EWG guideline)\n\n1.17 ppb (Rate this contaminant appears)\n\n0.004 ppb (EWG Health Guideline #)\n\n10 ppb (Legal limit)\n\n2.

Yet the EPA requires drinking water utilities across the country to test for only six of 14 known substances in the category.\n\nA variety of other contaminants often found in the water of millions of Americans can profoundly impact health. They include lead, which has been linked to brain damage in small children; arsenic, which can cause cancer; and copper, which can be harmful to infants.\n\nThe EPA did not respond to numerous requests by Patch seeking comment on the findings of the study.\n\nAccording to the environmental group, many of the 270-plus contaminants detected through water sampling are at levels deemed legal under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, yet are above levels that recent studies have found to pose possible health risks.\n\nVisit the environmental group's web page for Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Authority to see the recommended ways to combat the specific substances in your drinking water and the risks that they pose.\n\nThe environmental group has a clear opinion on the federal government's handling of water safety.\n\n\"The regulatory system meant to ensure the safety of America's drinking water is broken. The inexcusable failure of the federal government's responsibility to protect public health means there are no legal limits for more than 160 unregulated contaminants in U.S. tap water,\" Environmental Working Group researchers stated in its \"State of American Drinking Water.\"\n\nA focal point of the organization's concern is the Environmental Protection Agency's refusal to add a single new contaminant to the toxic chemicals list covered by the Safe Drinking Water Act in almost 20 years.\n\nIndependent experts agree.\n\n\"With the science on what we call 'emerging contaminants' continuing to grow, it is clear that there are components of our tap water that can be improved,\" Kristin Strock, professor of Environmental Science at Dickinson College, told Patch.\n\nStrock, who is not affiliated with the environmental group, also emphasized the challenges in the process of federally regulating harmful contaminants, suggesting the current system is somewhat backward.\n\n\"The road to regulating harmful contaminants is difficult, as our current construct for ensuring clean water is based on 'proving' that something is harmful before it is regulated as opposed to assuming contaminants could be harmful and 'proving' them safe before allowing them to go into industrial production and, as a result, our environment,\" she said. \"The EPA has been working on identifying safe limits for a number of these emerging contaminants and continues to work on the problem.\"\n\nThe Environmental Working Group also noted that the every-day person is frustratingly helpless to the chemicals going into their water supply, and the subsequent costs associated with different water filtering techniques.\n\nOlga Naidenko, vice president of science investigation at the group, further explained, \"Industries and companies that released PFAS into the environment and drinking water sources \u2014 should be responsible to covering such costs, as it is unfair for homeowners to be saddled with costs for pollution they did not create.\"\n\nThe water group does offer information, though, on filtering technologies that you can use to dramatically reduce water contamination. Filtering technology will help. Carbon filters, for example, will reduce many, but not all, contaminants.\n\nHow to Check Contaminants In Your Water:\n\nThe environmental group's public database catalogues contaminants in every water system in the country \u2014 the first such database of its kind. First, select the state where you live, and you'll see state-level data. For more local information, enter your ZIP code.\n\nAfter you enter your ZIP code, you'll be directed to a page showing the name of your water utility system. Select \"View Utility\" to see which contaminants were identified in your area.\n\nWhat You Can Do\n\nFor those with concerns, the environmental group provides a guide to buying water filters. If you find your local water supply has a particularly high level of a dangerous chemical, you can search for a filter that best blocks the specific substance.\n\nWhile water filters are important, the group also acknowledges they are more of a Band-Aid solution than an actual fix.\n\n\"We really want to iterate that's a first-line, temporary measure,\" Evans told Patch. \"It's what you can do today to protect yourself, but really we want long-term permanent change, and that's going to happen at the community level.\"\n\nSubsequently, the environmental group has created a set of seven questions to ask your elected officials about tap water.\n\nThe organization strongly believes that everyone can help in the battle to improve tap water safety.\n\n\"We absolutely believe in the power of personal advocacy \u2014 for individuals to reach out to their local elected officials of all levels. The power of people can come into play,\" Naidenko said.\n\nWhere The Environmental Working Group Gets Its Funding:\n\nThe majority of the group's funding comes from private charitable foundations, here's a partial list of the organization's largest backers.\n\n11th Hour Project\n\nCivil Society Institute\n\nJacob and Hilda Blaustein Foundation\n\nWilliam and Flora Hewlett Foundation\n\nThe McKnight Foundation\n\nPopplestone Foundation\n\nPark Foundation\n\nThe David and Lucile Packard Foundation\n\nBarbra Streisand Foundation\n\nTurner Foundation\n\nWallace Genetic Foundation\n\nThe Walton Foundation\n\nWinslow Foundation\n\nMore detailed information on the organization's funding and annual reports are available on its website.", "title": "Cancer-Linked Contaminants Found In Miami-Dade's Water: Report", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "['drinking_water']", "annot_city": "['Miami']"}, {"id": 381, "city": "['Washington']", "url": "https://patch.com/district-columbia/washingtondc/alert-dont-drink-dc-water-without-boiling-city-warns", "text": "WASHINGTON, DC -- The District of Columbia is warning residents in large parts of the city to boil water for the next 24 to 48 hours after a problem at a city pumping station.\n\nIt all started late Thursday night, when D.C. water tweeted just before 11 p.m. that there had been a temporary problem at the Bryant Street pumping station that caused the water pressure to drop.

Testing concluded on Sept. 3, 2018.\n\nAlerts about high bacteria levels, Berman said, are based on tests of water samples collected a day ahead of time. He urged swimmers to use common sense when deciding whether to go in the water.\n\nSave the Harbor/Save the Bay began its water quality testing program at urban beaches in 2011, Berman said, the same year the Boston Harbor cleanup project marked a major milestone with the opening of a massive sewage holding tank in South Boston.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 2.1-mile tank under Day Boulevard is credited with keeping dirty water out of the harbor when it rains.

The Boston Water and Sewer Commission has been working to identify problem connections, he said, and reroute waste.\n\nDolores Randolph, a commission spokeswoman, said Tenean Beach has been a challenge. Problem spots have been identified and fixed, she said, only for testing to reveal other areas that requires attention.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe commission, she said, has begun repairs on a problem spot that was recently identified and feels optimistic about the work.\n\nAt King\u2019s Beach, the bacteria levels have been linked to problems with stormwater pipes in Lynn and sewer systems in Swampscott, Berman said.\n\nIn 2015, Swampscott agreed to pay a $65,000 civil penalty after the US Environmental Protection Agency accused the town of discharging pollutants into its stormwater drainage system.\n\nSince then, the town has spent $4 million to enclose clay pipes in protective sleeves to prevent leaks, said Town Administrator Sean R.

(Kevin N. Hume/S.F. Examiner)\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday accused the city of San Francisco of violating the Clean Water Act by allegedly dumping untreated wastewater into oceans.\n\nIn a letter to San Francisco Public Utilities Commission General Manager Harlan Kelly, Regional EPA Administrator Michael Stoker said the city is failing to operate and properly maintain its wastewater collection facilities and failing to comply with water quality standards, among other violations.\n\nThe letter alleged the city discharged some two billion gallons of untreated sewer water into the ocean annually.\n\n\u201cThe failure to properly operate and maintain the city\u2019s sewage collection and treatment facilities creates public health risks. For example, lack of proper operation and maintenance has caused force main and pump station failures that have diverted substantial volumes of raw and partially-treated sewage to flow across the beaches and into the San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean,\u201d Stoker wrote.\n\n\u201cThere have been instances of sewage flowing into the streets and entering people\u2019s homes. Moreover, the city\u2019s data also show other pollutants of significant concern such as copper, zinc, lead, cyanide and ammonia that can threaten the water quality of the Bay and the ocean,\u201d the letter said.\n\nIf the city doesn\u2019t take immediate action to correct the allegations, the EPA said it could pursue injunctive relief or civil penalties.\n\nIn a statement, San Francisco Mayor London Breed responded to the letter, defending the city\u2019s sewer system and calling the allegations inaccurate.\n\n\u201cThe notice of violation issued today contained a series of mischaracterizations, inaccuracies and falsehoods, and is the latest example of the Trump administration\u2019s attack on our city and our state,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cSan Francisco has a combined sewer system, one of the best and most effective in the country, that ensures that all debris that flow into storm drains are filtered out at the city\u2019s wastewater treatment plants. No debris flow out into the Bay or the Ocean. In fact, the EPA recently awarded San Francisco the largest, merit-based award it has under its competitive loan program for water infrastructure,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump\u2019s sudden concern for California\u2019s environment is ironic considering he is undercutting the state\u2019s ambitious vehicle emission standards and climate change plans,\u201d she said.\n\nBreed added that the city is currently working with the EPA to replace aging infrastructure through the city\u2019s Sewer System Improvement Program.\n\nState Sen. Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco, said, \u201cThe same Trump EPA that is dismantling environmental protections around the country is now making fraudulent claims about San Francisco\u2019s combined sewer system\u2014a system that is a national model of sustainability.\n\n\u201cThe EPA has repeatedly signed off on San Francisco\u2019s sewer system over the years, yet the EPA is now issuing misleading statements about it. This \u2018Notice of Violation\u2019 by Trump\u2019s EPA is a fraudulent political attack on San Francisco by a collapsing Administration desperate to rile up its base,\u201d he said.\n\nBay Area Newssan francisco news\n\nIf you find our journalism valuable and relevant, please consider joining our Examiner membership program.\n\nFind out more at www.sfexaminer.com/join/", "title": "EPA alleges city dumped sewage into ocean, violating Clean Water Act \u2013 The San Francisco Examiner", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "['waste', 'drinking_water']", "annot_city": "['San Francisco']"}, {"id": 387, "city": "['Detroit']", "url": "https://eu.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/detroit-city/2019/06/27/detroit-water-sewer-upgrade/1583510001/", "text": "Detroit begins first massive upgrade of water, sewer pipes since Great Depression\n\nDetroit \u2014 A five-year, $500 million effort was announced Thursday to replace water and sewer pipes throughout the city, an undertaking city officials say would be the first massive upgrade of water and sewer lines since 1930.\n\nMayor Mike Duggan and officials with the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department announced a data-driven approach to upgrade the city\u2019s water and sewer systems at a press conference in the city's Russell Woods neighborhood, one of the communities identified by the water officials as needing the quickest fix. The approach is aimed at replacing or repairing the most vulnerable pipes first.\n\nIt's also the first major step in replacing an estimated 125,000 lead service pipes in the city, officials said. Lead pipes were at the center of controversy in Flint's water crisis.\n\nDetroit's data-driven approach will assess individual neighborhoods that allow water officials \"to figure out where are the oldest pipes,\" Duggan said. \"Where are they most likely to break? And how do we put our investment in it?\"\n\nMore than 50 miles of water main and sewer collection pipe will be replaced or lined this year. And projects aimed at better managing 37 million gallons of stormwater will be done to prevent flooding.\n\nThe water and sewerage department will replace existing lead service lines that often connect to older residences to the main water and sewer lines. Lead pipes can cause serious health risks if the pipes become corroded and particles enter drinking water.\n\nIt could take decades to get to all of the city's water and sewer pipes, officials said.\n\n\u201cWe are responsible for 2,700 miles of transmission and distribution water mains and nearly 3,000 miles of sewer collection piping,\u201d Brown said.\n\nIn 2018, the city upgraded 25 miles of water main, lined 22 miles of sewer piping and replaced 173 lead service lines. This was the most water and sewer construction in the past 15 years, officials said.\n\nIn late 2017, the city started the data-driven approach with pilot areas in North Rosedale Park and Cornerstone Village by flushing the hydrants, detecting leaks in the water mains and placing cameras in the sewer pipes.\n\nWater and sewer condition assessments have since also been done in Brewster Douglass, Brightmoor, Jefferson Chalmers, Miller Grove, Minock Park, Rosedale Park (south), and Riverdale.\n\nThe results of the assessments are being reviewed and designs are underway for the infrastructure that needs rehabilitation.\n\nThe data was used to design water and sewer upgrades for the two neighborhoods where construction will begin this year.\n\nPalencia Mobley, DWSD deputy director and chief engineer, said \"so far,\" the city has found that one out of every four miles of infrastructure needs \"replacement or rehabilitation.\u201d\n\nThe $500 million to pay for the upgrades will come from several sources. One is the leasing revenues from the regional water system, called the Great Lakes Water Authority, created during the city's bankruptcy. The city gets $50 million in annual lease payments.\n\nBrown also noted a 94% collections rate from people who are behind on their water bills. That's up from 77% in 2016. That adds up to about $60 million in additional revenue. Further, the city's improved financial status allows it to borrow money from Wall Street.\n\nStill, the city will need further assistance to meet a new state mandate that requires public utilities to dig up lead service lines and replace them all within 20 years. The rule is in response to the Flint water crisis.\n\nBrown said the city will need \"financial assistance\" to step up its pace of lead pipe removal to meet the 20-year goal.\n\nlaguilar@detroitnews.com\n\nTwitter: @LouisAguilar_DN", "title": "Detroit begins 5-year, $500M upgrades of water and sewer pipes.", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "['drinking_water']", "annot_city": "['Detroit']"}, {"id": 388, "city": "['Minneapolis']", "url": "https://www.wastetodaymagazine.com/article/minneapolis-bans-residential-battery-recycling-waste-collection/", "text": "CalRecycle and Cal OES joined forces after the fire to remove debris, the total tonnage of which equated to 10 Empire State Buildings.\n\nOn the heels of the one-year anniversary of the Camp Fire, the most deadly wildfire in state history, the California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle), based in Sacramento, and the Governor\u2019s Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES) have announced the completion of debris removal on nearly 11,000 properties.\n\nThe fire started on Nov. 8, 2018, in Northern California's Butte County and wasn\u2019t fully contaminated until 17 days later. It caused at least 85 fatalities. In addition, more than 150,000 acres had been burned and close to 19,000 buildings were destroyed. The total cost of the fire damage was estimated at $16.5 billion.\n\nCalRecycle says in a news release that the debris removal project was the largest of its type in state history and was jointly managed by Cal OES and CalRecycle. Crews removed more than 3.66 million tons\u2014or 7.3 billion pounds\u2014of ash, debris, metal, concrete, and contaminated soil in nine months as part of California\u2019s Consolidated Debris Removal Program. The total tonnage of debris removed during the cleanup is equivalent to 10 Empire State Buildings.\n\n\u201cThis is a story of resilience, and I am inspired by the people of Paradise\u2019s grit and their resolve to move forward after last year\u2019s devastating fire,\u201d says California Gov. Gavin Newsom in the news release. \u201cOur state continues to stand with the communities and all families that were impacted.\u201d\n\nCamp Fire recovery\n\nThe cleanup effort spanned approximately 13,400 properties. It was divided into two phases: removal of household hazardous waste and removal of other fire-related debris.\n\nThe first phase of the cleanup began Dec. 3 and took two months as crews sorted through on-site rubble and ash to remove remnants of household hazardous waste, including paints, cleaners, solvents, oils, batteries, pesticides, compressed cylinders and tanks and easily identifiable asbestos.\n\nCleanup crews started the second phase\u2014which involved site assessment and documentation, debris removal, erosion control measures and final inspection\u2014Jan. 7. It cost an estimated $1.35 billion, though final calculations are still being carried out, according to CalRecycle.\n\nAfter a competitive bid process that ended Jan. 22, CalRecycle selected ECC Constructors LLC, Burlingame, California; SPSG Partners JV, a joint venture including Sukut Construction, Pacific States Environmental Contractors, and Goodfellow Bros.; and Sarasota, Florida-based Ceres Environmental Services Inc., doing business as Environmental & Demolition Services Group, as the primary contractors for the cleanup. Each primary contractor employed a number of subcontractors to help facilitate the cleanup.\n\nThe debris removal operation was part of a wider effort by Newsom to help communities impacted by destructive wildfires rebuild and recover, CalRecycle says.\n\n\u201cDebris removal is an important first step in the rebuilding of Butte County and the Town of Paradise,\u201d CalRecycle Director Scott Smithline says. \u201cFrom our contractors to our state, local and federal partners, we are proud of everyone who has worked to help this community rebuild while keeping public and environmental health at the forefront.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s announcement marks an important milestone in helping Butte County rebuild and recover. The hard work of local, state and federal agencies following this catastrophic event and the unprecedented speed of this operation is a testament to the resolve and resiliency of Californians,\u201d says Mark Ghilarducci, director of Cal OES.\n\nThe debris removal program, implemented in coordination with local governments, offered survivors a streamlined option to clear their properties at no out-of-pocket cost. The state, along with local and federal partners, has assisted with multiple aspects of the recovery process, including:\n\n\u2022 Establishing temporary short-term housing solutions for nearly 700 households displaced by the fire.\n\n\u2022 Facilitating technical and grant expertise for the Paradise Irrigation District to help restore Paradise\u2019s water system.\n\n\u2022 Supporting public assistance projects to restore public infrastructure.\n\n\u2022 Providing support and coordination for emotional and behavioral needs of children and their families.\n\nNewsom also approved a rural designation for Paradise and other surrounding parts of Butte County, making the areas eligible for additional funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development Program funds totaling more than $500 million.\n\n\n\nFollowing the Camp Fire, California is the first state nationally to establish the Interagency Recovery Coordination functions\u2014a federal model\u2014to directly assist town and county officials with long-term recovery needs and initiatives.\n\n\n\nMore action\n\nNewsom has taken more critical actions beyond cleanup in response to the Camp Fire in the year since it ravaged the northern half of the state.\n\n\n\nOn recovery, he invested:\n\n$31.8 million for lost local property taxes for California communities recovering from disasters.\n\n$10 million in additional support to local governments to help with the Camp Fire recovery.\n\n$28.8 million for the California Disaster Assistance Act to assist local governments with disaster recovery.\n\n$6.6 million for a health and wellness program to support emergency responders.\n\nOn preparedness, he invested:\n\n$50 million in fiscal year 2019 for Listos California, an emergency preparedness outreach campaign.\n\n$60 million, including $10 million in fiscal year 2019 and a revised fee structure that goes into effect next year, to upgrade California\u2019s 911 system, and $1 million for a first responder broadband network and integration with the 911 system.\n\n$75 million to build resiliency and surge capacity in the event of a utility company\u2019s decision to initiate a public safety power shutdown.\n\n$38.9 million to expand the state\u2019s capacity for emergency planning and enhance an all-hands response to disasters.\n\n$730,000 to help streamline hazardous fuel treatment programs.\n\n$41 million to increase inspections and enhance overview of utility companies\u2019 wildfire mitigation programs.\n\n$225.8 million from Cap-and-Trade revenues and the General Fund for forest health, fuel reduction, and other wildfire prevention efforts\u2014including $200 million of SB 901 funds allocated annually for five years.\n\n$16.3 million to finish the build-out of California\u2019s earthquake early warning system.\n\nOn response, he invested:\n\n$67.5 million to expand firefighting surge capacity.\n\n$127.2 million for C-130 air tankers and firefighting helicopters.\n\n$130.3 million for better communication equipment for first responders.\n\n$24.7 million for CAL Fire to procure innovative solutions to the wildfire crisis via the Innovation Procurement Sprint, operate fire detection cameras and enhance situational awareness staffing.\n\n$25 million for prepositioning Cal OES and local government firefighting resources as part of the statewide mutual aid system, in advance of a potential wildfire threat driven by forecasted weather conditions.\n\nAdditionally, Newsom:\n\nExpedited forest management projects to protect 200 of California\u2019s most wildfire-vulnerable communities.\n\nDeployed the California National Guard to assist CAL Fire with emergency hazardous fuels-management projects.\n\nAwarded $20 million in block grants to improve forest health and increase fire resiliency.\n\nJoined with Governors Kate Brown of Oregon and Jay Inslee of Washington in requesting President Donald Trump double the federal government\u2019s financial investment in managing federal forestlands in California, Washington and Oregon.\n\nLaunched an initiative to get the most cutting-edge tools into the field and tackle the wildfire threat, resulting in two pilot projects to help modernize wildfire prevention and response.\n\nPartnered with XPRIZE to design an incentive prize for innovation to battle wildfires.\n\nSecured delegation of authority from the Secretary of Defense to fly CalGuard\u2019s infra-red equipped Unmanned Aerial System in support of CAL Fire missions.\n\nPartnered with the federal government to secure state access to satellite-based technology to detect wildfire ignitions.\n\nOn legislation, Newsom:\n\nSigned a series of bills aimed at improving California\u2019s wildfire prevention, mitigation, and response efforts, continuing progress toward the state\u2019s clean energy goals and holding utilities accountable by creating an insurance fund to cover future wildfire liabilities.

The vote will be certified on Nov. 24.\n\nInitiative 300 creates a new building code that requires green roofs or solar panels for most buildings 25,000 square feet or larger that are constructed after Jan. 1, 2018.\n\nThe Associated Press noted that the measure is more stringent than other green roof mandates, as it requires many existing buildings to be retrofitted with green roofs when the old roof wears out. Older buildings that cannot support the load of a green roof can get an exemption.\n\n\n\n\"These required building improvements would significantly reduce long term operating costs by lowering energy consumption and increasing the longevity of a roof,\" the Denver Green Roof Initiative stated on its campaign website. \"A green roof lasts 2-3 times as long as a traditional roof because the waterproofing membrane is protected from damage by the elements and workers by covering it with a growing medium and plants.\"\n\nThe measure did not have an easy road to passage. Denver Mayor Michael Hancock opposed the initiative over worries that it could drive up the costs of construction projects. Also, several Denver businesses spent $250,000 in an advertising push against the plan.\n\nDepartment of Community Planning and Development spokeswoman Andrea Burns told the Denver Post in March that the department would prefer to give architects and engineers \"the flexibility to design a roofing system that works best for their needs and their budgets.\"\n\nFollowing the vote, however, Burns conceded to CBS4 that \"it will be a little bit of work in the next few weeks, but green roofs are already possible in Denver. It's just a matter of making those agreements that are part of Initiative 300 work with our system now. We're going to make this work for the people of Denver.\"\n\nThe Denver Green Roof Initiative admits that green roofs cost about $15 more per square feet than a traditional black roof but pointed out that the green roof will pay for itself in about six years.\n\n\n\n\"Even though the extra cost would be offset in as soon as 6.2 years, most developers choose not to incorporate them because they build the building then sell it,\" the group said. \"They don't see those energy and storm-water savings. They don't save the money from roof longevity. Yet they are still able to sell the building for more money with these improvements!! We believe that the developers of Denver could be doing more to negate their footprint in our beautiful city. We believe green roofs are the answer.\"\n\nThe initiative was endorsed by several green builders and environmental groups.\n\n\"Initiative I-300 will contribute to improving Denver's air quality, increasing the energy efficiency of its buildings, mitigating the urban heat island effect, managing storm water runoff, and creating habitat for pollinators and other insects,\" said Lauren Petrie, Food & Water Watch's Rocky Mountain Region Director. \"We are dedicated to a more sustainable future in Denver and believe that passing this green roof initiative will be a vehicle for asserting our human desire for cleaner air and water, and cooler urban temperatures.\n\nThe Denver Green Roof Initiative stressed in a Facebook post Friday that even though Initiative 300 passed, there are still \"tremendous hurdles to overcome due to push back from those in power.\"\n\n\n\n\"This is a battle won against climate but the war doesn't stop here,\" the post stated. \"We must all get active and fight for our values, because we are stronger together.

So, as is often on view around the city\u2019s tech and entrepreneurship community (as recently as Tuesday night at Johns Hopkins\u2019 Social Innovation Lab\u2019s Impact and Innovation Forum), solving them will require resolve to think systemically and create solutions with a different approach than what\u2019s been taken before.\n\nAs if to underscore this point, news broke while I was writing this piece that Catherine Pugh resigned as mayor of Baltimore as she faces multiple investigations related to payments she received for a children\u2019s book series called \u201cHealthy Holly.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an important moment in the city\u2019s history, and difficult to ignore even for a niche publication such as ours. The scandal that\u2019s engulfed Pugh in the weeks since the Baltimore Sun broke the story that she received $500,000 through a no-bid contract with the University of Maryland Medical System while she sat on that organization\u2019s board shows the need for change on multiple levels.\n\nBut in that time, as Baltimore has been in the first days of what will now be an extended tenure under now-former City Council President Bernard C. \u201cJack\u201d Young, there have also been reminders \u2014 albeit on a smaller scale \u2014 that the work of the city continues.\n\nAs a reporter covering a part of the city\u2019s work that involves the people who seem removed from the political apparatus, those reminders come often to me. Just today, for instance, we covered an announcement that the city has a new emergency alert system.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe work to create lasting solutions also continues. On Wednesday in one of the few buildings amid the wooded area in Cylburn Arboretum, more than 50 people gathered to begin developing the ideas that will be part of the solutions built at Hack Baltimore. Looking out over the trees, it felt appropriately removed from City Hall, even as attendees tackled the challenges that the city government is charged with addressing.\n\nBringing together organizers of multiple short-duration, tech-constructing events, Hack Baltimore is planned as a citywide tech planning for a citywide hackathon in 2020 that will build solutions in six areas.\n\nDelali Dzirasa, the technologist and founder of Fearless who is the chair for the event and leads along with an organizing committee, said they\u2019re looking to take an approach that ensures projects that are built will be used as solutions by the people they\u2019re designed to help. While hackathons produce plenty of interesting technology and new approaches to solving problems, the fact that they usually take place on weekends can also make them temporary.\n\nSo by doing lots of work ahead of time, Hack Baltimore\u2019s organizing team is looking to ensure that the civic leaders who use the solution are getting something they need, and are involved in the process of developing it.\n\nThe first step in that process is identifying the challenges and the ideas to help solve them. That\u2019s where the design jam comes in. Dzirasa said the group focused on challenges in areas such as housing, transportation, public safety, workforce development, health and education. The problem statements that arose at this and other events will appear on a portal where they can be accessed by all. Ideas will also be curated directly from the public beyond such events. They\u2019ll be refined, and then ultimately an innovative solution will be pitched against the ideas.\n\nDzirasa stressed that the most important aspect of the effort is to sustain the work. So they\u2019re documenting the work from the start.\n\n\u201cIf we\u2019re going to do this, we\u2019re going to document in a public way and post it on the citywide portal, Dzirasa said.\u201d If we stop at first base, someone should be able to take that and go to second base, and then third base.\u201d\n\nPutting them in that space ensures that what has been developed will live on, even if the people who are leading and working on them changes.\n\n-30-", "title": "Baltimore will need sustainable solutions.

His last piece in Politico Magazine explored the economic benefits to immigrant communities along the commuter rail line connecting St. Paul and Minneapolis.\n\nST. LOUIS\u2014Deep down a sunlit shaft, 175 feet under the North Riverfront neighborhood on the city\u2019s far edge, Shayne Peck\u2019s crew is beginning to hack a giant tunnel out of the limestone. Three men hang in the air on lifts, cutting into the rock face at spots marked with red paint. \u201cThey\u2019re drilling holes,\u201d says Peck, whose son is one of the drillers, \u201cso we can load \u2019em with explosives.\u201d\n\nThe start of the tunnel, just above the crew and the red-painted limestone, looks like the entrance to a cave in a cliff wall. Future blasts, Peck says, will deepen the tunnel\u2014only 50 feet long now\u2014 until it stretches more than half a mile. This is not a tunnel for commuter trains or cars. It\u2019s more of a horizontal well, and when it is complete in 2020, it will capture up to 12 million gallons of sewage-contaminated storm water, keeping it out of the Mississippi River. In effect, it will be a giant septic tank. But it won\u2019t even be the biggest one in St. Louis.\n\nThe massive tunnel Peck has just started will soon be dwarfed by its successors. St. Louis is building a gargantuan system, including 28 miles of storage tunnels, to handle the city\u2019s most stomach-churning water pollution problem. About 50 times a year, after major rainstorms, St. Louis\u2019 sewers overflow, and 13 billion gallons of sewage-contaminated storm water escapes into the Mississippi River and its tributaries. It\u2019s an everyday environmental nightmare and a risk to human health. And it\u2019s a common, if largely undiscussed, urban American affliction.\n\nAll across the Northeast and Midwest, and in some regions beyond, more than 700 older cities still dump toilet waste into their oceans, lakes and rivers. The nasty problem is built into the cities\u2019 infrastructure, a relic of early 20th-century engineering practices that were considered engineering triumphs in their day. The sewer systems, built decades ago, combine storm water and wastewater in the same pipes. On normal days, those millions of gallons of waste pass through a treatment plant. But after storms, the sewers become overwhelmed and the treatment plants can\u2019t keep up. Instead of allowing the excess water to back up into streets and basements, the solution from decades past was to build overflow valves that divert some of the untreated flow into the nearest waterway. According to an Environmental Protection Agency report, just at the nation\u2019s major beaches\u2014a small portion of the country\u2019s swimming areas\u2014about 3,500 to 5,000 Americans a year get sick because of sewage-contaminated water.\n\nThat\u2019s not OK anymore. Under pressure from the federal government, cities have embarked on decades-long projects to cut down on the sewage they spew. Since the 1990s, the EPA has used the Clean Water Act to take legal action against about 200 large and medium-sized cities. For big cities, the cost of compliance runs into the billions of dollars.\n\nConstruction workers at the Maline Creek Storage Facility work inside a 175-foot-deep, 50-foot-diameter shaft to dig a tunnel that will hold millions of gallons of sewage tainted wastewater after storms, preventing contamination of nearby rivers. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine\n\nSt. Louis\u2019 agreement with the EPA, signed in 2012, is the most expensive in the continental U.S. It commits the region to spending $4.7 billion in engineering projects over 23 years to cut down on sewer overflow. As toxic as its effects are on water quality, the cure can be brutal for taxpayers, many of whom might never have been aware of the problem until they learned that their sewer fees would triple or more to pay for the solution. The regional program in St. Louis, called Project Clear, will cost about $3,600 across those 23 years for every man, woman and child in the city and its suburbs.\n\n\u201cOver 20 million people get their drinking water from the Mississippi River, including the city of St. Louis,\u201d says Francis Slay, whose 16-year tenure as St. Louis mayor ended April 18. \u201cSo it\u2019s of absolute importance to make sure we have clean water.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSlay, while aware of the environmental consequences of doing nothing, nevertheless had an obligation to his constituents to soften the impact to their pocketbooks. After the EPA and a local environmental group sued St. Louis\u2019 Metropolitan Sewer District in 2007, Slay, a Democrat, joined the negotiations and argued for a less costly project. \u201cWe were fighting for the taxpayers,\u201d he says. \u201cI was looking at cost, rates, timing, trying to do all we can to make it as reasonable as possible. And of course the EPA wanted to do it quicker, and they wanted it to be more expensive to start with\u2014the same thing that was going on in cities across America.\u201d\n\nOvercast skies loom above St. Louis, also known as \"the gateway to the West.\" | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine\n\nThis cost containment encouraged the city to get creative. Instead of even more tunnels, St. Louis and the EPA agreed to substitute innovative ways of controlling storm water. Project Clear includes $100 million of green infrastructure projects, which give nature and open space the job of soaking up rain before it ever gets to the gutters. The sewer agency is building rain gardens on vacant lots and paying businesses to add water-thirsty minigardens to their developments. Many of the Metropolitan Sewer District\u2019s green projects do more than lighten the burden on the sewers\u2014they also have side effects that help St. Louis\u2019 neighborhoods.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t just spend the money we\u2019re spending, and solve our problem, and have most of the solutions be underground,\u201d says Brian Hoelscher, the sewer agency\u2019s CEO. \u201cWe\u2019re finding every opportunity we can to team with somebody\u2026In a lot of cases, it makes the cost of our program less.\u201d\n\nThe MSD is a regional agency that works closely with the city of St. Louis, whose mayor appoints half its board. That cooperation grew even closer on March 23, when the sewer agency began a $13.5 million effort to tear down condemned homes inside St. Louis and replace them with open space. The project will double the number of vacant, blighted homes torn down in St. Louis from 200 a year to 400\u2014a huge help to a city that has lost more than half its population since its peak of 857,000 in 1950. For the neighborhood, each tear-down means one less dangerous eyesore. For the sewer system, each newly empty lot means about 10,000 fewer gallons of storm water coming in per year, which means less tainted overflow spilling out.\n\nBut by far the biggest component of the project is the tunnel system, which keeps 30 men occupied more or less full time, and will do so for many years to come. Shayne Peck, 47, a fourth-generation tunneler whose family built coal mines, used to excavate for the Chicago sewers. \u201cI\u2019m open to staying here in St. Louis,\u201d Peck says. \u201cI only need eight more years until I\u2019m retired.\u201d\n\nImage (Top Left) A man runs through the River des Peres greenway.

It might look bucolic but it\u2019s man-made, constructed less than 20 years ago to imitate a real river that disappeared from the park more than a century ago. Near the waterway, in the park\u2019s northeast corner, behind an overlooked gate set in the earth, concrete steps lead underground to reveal what happened to that lost river. Down below, a pair of century-old concrete tunnels, dark and ominous, rise 29 feet high to vaulted ceilings. The sound of flowing water echoes off the walls.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re standing inside a combined sewer,\u201d says Lance LeComb, spokesman for the MSD. \u201cIt just happens to be a very large one.\u201d\n\nIn one tunnel, brown water flows slowly, carrying a bit of debris now and then. A short weir divides the tunnel from its slightly higher twin, which holds a little trail of standing water. The flowing water, LeComb says, is wastewater coming from the western suburb of University City, four miles away. Across the channel, he points out the opening of a smaller tunnel in the far wall, where storm water from St. Louis\u2019 Union Boulevard empties into the sewer.\n\nA map of the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis, which was held in Forest Park. Officials had to hide a river that had been used as an open sewer. | Wikimedia Commons\n\nThis massive tunnel structure is what\u2019s left of the River des Peres here in Forest Park. More than a century ago, the river bent here, turning from east to south on its route to the Mississippi River. But St. Louis, like many older cities, used its rivers and creeks as sewers in the 19th century. In 1904, when St. Louis held the World\u2019s Fair in Forest Park, this stretch of the River des Peres stank so badly that the city enclosed it in a long wooden box. In the 1910s and 1920s, St. Louis banished the foul waterway permanently. The city dug an open-cut trench four miles long, built the twin tunnels inside, then buried them.\n\nCrowds outside the Palace of Fine Arts during the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis. | Missouri State Archives\n\nThe tunnels are an engineering marvel, even now. They were declared a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1988. But even this mammoth structure, St. Louis\u2019 largest combined sewer, can\u2019t handle a heavy rain without overflowing. About a mile south, where the twin tunnels open into daylight, the water they carry falls through two large grates and into other sewers that run straight to the Lemay Wastewater Treatment Plant, the region\u2019s second-largest sewage facility, which can treat up to 340 million gallons of water a day. But after storms, the grates become overwhelmed and the excess storm water and waste water spill into the last 10 miles of the River des Peres. Dozens more overflowing sewers do the same, feeding into the river before it opens into the Mississippi 10 miles south of the iconic Gateway Arch.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not much of a river anymore,\u201d says LeComb. \u201cIt\u2019s what happens to urban rivers in America.\u201d\n\nCities in 32 states have combined sewers. They\u2019re mostly in the Northeast and the Midwest, where sewers often date from the mid-20th century or earlier. (Cities in the interior West and Southwest, which developed later, tended to build sewers that separate sewage from storm water.) But in those older cities, diluted sewage still overflows into rivers, lakes and oceans after rain. The consequences for public health are serious. Bacteria common in sewage, including salmonella and E. coli, can cause stomach and intestinal illness. Viruses can also lead to fever, skin infections and respiratory illness. Fishermen who eat their catch from polluted rivers are also at risk. Just how much risk depends on the body of water being polluted\u2014how big it is, how fast it moves and how people interact with it. In many Great Lakes cities, signs go up on urban beaches after heavy summer storms, warning visitors that bacteria levels are too high for them to swim. One Cleveland beach had an advisory posted for half of all summer days in 2015.\n\nSince 1994, the EPA has worked its way across the country, roughly from east to west, suing cities\u2019 sewer departments and agencies to force them to clean up. The result has been negotiated settlements (consent decrees overseen by federal judges) with cities such as Atlanta ($1.1 billion in 1998), Washington ($2.6 billion in 2003), Cincinnati ($3.3 billion in 2004), and Cleveland ($3 billion in 2011).\n\nThe enormous projects promised in consent decrees have meant big contracts for construction firms\u2014and, sometimes, a chance for the unscrupulous to profiteer. A 1993 consent decree to improve the sewers of Birmingham, Alabama, played a role in a spectacular corruption scandal. It led to multiple bribery convictions of public officials and contractors\u2014and Jefferson County\u2019s 2011 municipal bankruptcy.\n\nThe River des Peres receives water run off from an industrial district in the city. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine\n\nIn 2015, the EPA declared that it, or state agencies, had addressed overflows in 201 of the nation\u2019s 213 largest combined sewer systems. Only a few big cities have escaped lawsuits, most of them because they confronted their sewer overflows early. Milwaukee started to build tunnels to capture overflows in the 1970s. Philadelphia, which cooperates closely with the EPA, came to a less formal agreement instead of being sued. (New York City has a legal agreement with its state government, not the feds, to curb overflows.)\n\nHomeowners bear the costs of the anti-pollution projects, usually in spiking sewer bills. The EPA considers sewer rates a high burden if they\u2019re more than 2 percent of a region\u2019s median household income\u2014but even then, it wants communities to finish their clean-water projects in 15 to 20 years. So local officials often come to consent decree negotiations seeking to limit how much they\u2019ll have to spend to control overflows and how many years they\u2019ll have to finish.\n\nThose stakes were especially high for the St. Louis region. It has the nation\u2019s fourth-largest sewer system, behind only New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. The city of St. Louis also has a high poverty rate, so sewer bills can take up a big portion of poorer city homeowners\u2019 budgets.\n\nGoing into consent-decree negotiations, the sewer agency braced itself for a $6 billion bill and 15 to 17 years to get the work done. That would\u2019ve sent sewer rates soaring, from a low $14 a month for the average single-family house in 2003, and $28 a month in 2011, past $100 a month in the 2020s.\n\n\u201cIf they had just charged us more money and wanted to get it done quicker, it would have been devastating,\u201d says Slay, the former mayor. \u201cWe have a high level of poverty in the city of St. Louis. What we\u2019re doing now is going to be a heavy burden on households.\u201d\n\nOne of the innovative ways St. Louis has figured out to reduce storm water reaching its sewer system is by demolishing derelict homes and leaving the lot vacant. A vacant lot, such as this one on Labadie Street in central St. Louis, can absorb 10,000 gallons of rain water in a year. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine\n\nInstead, the 2012 consent decree settled on $4.7 billion over 23 years. That included $1.8 billion to reduce combined sewer overflows in the city and some nearby suburbs, mostly by building those 28 miles of storage tunnels. It also includes $2 billion to eliminate sanitary sewer overflows in the outer suburbs\u2014a different challenge that involves keeping storm water out of the separate wastewater system, testing sewer lines for clogs and cleaning them out, building above-ground storage tanks, and disconnecting suburban homes\u2019 downspouts from the sewer system.\n\nThe St. Louis consent decree is still the second largest the EPA has negotiated in a sewer case, second only to Honolulu\u2019s $5 billion. St. Louis saved a lot of money by persuading the EPA to let it deal with overflows in half of the city without building interceptor tunnels\u2014by building green infrastructure instead of gray.\n\n***\n\nThe old bungalow\u2019s front-porch roof was splintered and sagging. Its roof tiles were tattered, a gutter was gone and a missing side door or window was replaced by only a thin board. It was just one of thousands of vacant buildings in St. Louis\u2014but on March 23, the mayor, the local alderman, and the head of St. Louis\u2019 sewer agency came out to see an excavator\u2019s claw tear it down.\n\nWith that demolition, the sewer agency became a partner in the city\u2019s drive to knock down its most ruined houses. St. Louis has lost more than half its population since the mid-20th century, settling at 318,000 today. When people leave, they leave houses behind. Parts of north St. Louis are peppered with empty houses in various states of decay. \u201cDoll houses,\u201d some St. Louisans call them because a missing wall, ripped away by scavengers, lets you look straight inside.\n\nMSD\u2019s $13.5 million home demolition program will knock down about 200 more houses a year (up from 200) and leave the lots vacant to absorb rainwater. A pilot program showed that the newly vacant lots reduced the load on the sewer system by soaking up more rain. Every acre of impervious surface removed translated into 231,000 gallons less sewer overflow.\n\n(Top) The Old North Rain Garden is a community garden that also helps prevent excess rain water from overwhelming the sewer system. (Bottom left) Jeffery Boyd, alderman of Ward 22. (Bottom right) Yolanda Rhodes in front of her shop, A Touch of Glory. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine\n\nAlderman Jeffrey Boyd, whose north St. Louis ward includes some of the city\u2019s most vacant lots, calls it a win-win for the sewer agency and his constituents. \u201cOne of the biggest concerns people have in the neighborhood are the vacant buildings,\u201d says Boyd, \u201cthat either they\u2019ll fall on someone, or some kid\u2019s going to get snatched up into one.\u201d\n\nSt. Louis\u2019 consent agreement with the EPA includes $100 million in green infrastructure projects\u2014changes to the land that keep rain out of the sewer system. It\u2019s one of the largest such commitments in the country. And it\u2019ll transform empty land across St. Louis\u2019 north side.\n\nLike the rain garden on a vacant lot in St. Louis\u2019 Old North neighborhood. Created by MSD, the garden is specially landscaped and engineered to absorb storm water from nearby streets. Even in late March, before it blooms fully, the lot is a subtle landscape of green, red and orange plants. Purple coneflower, sumac and sedges, all native to Missouri, were chosen to appeal to birds and butterflies and to soak up a lot of rain. The land is sculpted into a basin, lower than street level. In the streets around the garden, cuts in the curbs look like gutters\u2014but they flow into the garden instead of underground.\n\nThough the two-century-old Old North neighborhood has suffered from abandonment, it has begun to experience prosperity, too. The Crown Square project, completed in 2010, rehabilitated 27 historic buildings a few blocks down North 14th Street. Development is springing up even closer to the rain garden: new houses in a row two blocks away, some homes with stickers still on their new windows the other direction. Future developers of nearby blocks will benefit from the rain garden taking in some of their property\u2019s storm runoff from their property. \u201cIf a new development goes in over there,\u201d says MSD\u2019s LeComb, \u201cthat new development won\u2019t have to pay for the same level of storm water control, because it\u2019s already being done by us.\u201d\n\nWest of downtown St. Louis, developers have benefited directly from another MSD program, which compensates them if they build green infrastructure. The parking lot of the new Ikea on Forest Park Boulevard is ringed with green gardens full of rain-slurping plants. A new office park on several nearby blocks has little gardens and tree lawns next to the street, soaking in rain from the street.\n\nImage Reflections in the Forest Park waterway, a manmade channel that runs through the park near where the River des Peres once did. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine\n\nAcross the country, forward-thinking sewer agencies are building green infrastructure and calculating where it\u2019ll do the most good, both for the sewer system and the community. Kansas City, Missouri, which signed a $2.4 billion consent decree in 2010, aims to create $68 million in green infrastructure, much of it in the city\u2019s Marlborough neighborhood, where a nine-acre park with a wetland pond is under construction. DC Water in Washington plans to install permeable pavement in six locations in the District this summer and fall. In the Brightwood neighborhood, it\u2019s already spent $2 million on street trees and little curbside pockets of green space to collect rain water.\n\nBack in St. Louis, the green infrastructure program isn\u2019t the only part of Project Clear that\u2019s changing the city\u2019s landscape. MSD is also spending $230 million on its Cityshed program, which has tackled flooding that burdens the sewer system. In eight low-lying areas, including valleys where creeks once ran, MSD offered to buy the homes of a couple of hundred homeowners whose basements chronically flood. All but a few of them have taken the sewer agency\u2019s offers and moved. LeComb says the agency followed federal guidelines on fair financial offers to relocate homeowners, paying moving expenses and the cost of buying a comparable home elsewhere.\n\nMSD\u2019s clean-water plans split St. Louis in half. The north and east get green infrastructure, while the south and west get old-fashioned gray infrastructure\u2014tunnels and other projects made of concrete and steel. There are two reasons for the split. Sewers in the north and east flow, and overflow, directly to the Mississippi River. Sewers in the south and west head to the River des Peres. Coincidentally, that water divide roughly lines up with St. Louis\u2019 economic and social divides. The north side, home to the city\u2019s predominantly African-American neighborhoods, has suffered for decades from white flight and disinvestment. Today, it\u2019s struggling the most with vacant and abandoned properties. That\u2019s left more room for green space, and more demand for demolition projects.\n\nBoyd, the alderman, says he\u2019s not aware of any opposition to Project Clear\u2019s different approaches for the two sides of town. MSD\u2019s green goals for the north side fit his constituents\u2019 wishes. They responded to the March 23 demolition with enthusiasm. \u201cAfter a story aired, I got calls: \u2018Would you consider [knocking down] a building on my street?\u2019\u201d\n\nFormer Mayor Francis Slay (left) and Planning Director Don Roe worked with the Metropolitan Sewer District to choose the locations of its green infrastructure projects, including its home demolitions.\n\nBut there are limits to what green infrastructure can do for a city and its sewers. The EPA allowed St. Louis to go all-green to the north because less stringent water-quality standards apply to the Mississippi River. On the south side of town, where sewers overflow into the River des Peres, storage tunnels and other gray infrastructure will slash the overflow volume, currently 6.3 billion gallons a year, by roughly 80 percent. On the north side, the $100 million in green infrastructure will reduce the volume of the sewage-tainted overflows going directly into the Mississippi by 110 million gallons a year\u2014less than 2 percent of the 7 billion gallons that overflow there every year. Since the River des Peres flows into the Mississippi, that means Project Clear will reduce the total overflows into the Mississippi by about 40 percent.\n\nIs it OK to let so much sewage into the Mississippi River? It seems like a shoddy way to treat America\u2019s most legendary waterway, which carried Mark Twain and Huckleberry Finn to exploration and adventure. But the ways Americans have used and altered the Mississippi actually explain the different treatment.\n\nNear St. Louis \u201cwe have a very fast-flowing, managed river that\u2019s really constructed for commerce,\u201d says Hoelscher, the sewer agency\u2019s CEO. \u201cWe don\u2019t have beaches.\u201d In short, it\u2019s a river that doesn\u2019t need a lot of coddling.\n\nThe EPA has several levels of water-quality standards, depending in part on how people use a lake or river. It\u2019s a quarter-mile wide at St. Louis, with a strong current. No one dips into it for a swim\u2014it\u2019s too dangerous. In fact, though St. Louis celebrates its identity as a riverfront city, there aren\u2019t many places where people can visit the river. Industrial uses line its banks north of downtown. Even near the Gateway Arch and in Laclede\u2019s Landing, the historic waterfront neighborhood, tall concrete levees guard against floods. The EPA doesn\u2019t consider the Mississippi a waterway for swimming, though it does require enough pollution controls to protect \"secondary\" recreation, such as boating and fishing. That contributes to its tolerance for continued sewer overflows along its banks. The giant waterway can absorb, dilute, churn and metabolize more pollution than a trickling stream in a drainage channel\u2014such as the River des Peres.\n\nSo, despite all the ways green infrastructure can improve and beautify a city, sewer agencies can\u2019t go all-green, because concrete tunnels usually provide more bang for the buck. Which brings us back to the titanic engineering project now underway.\n\n\n\n***\n\nEven where the River des Peres still exists, it\u2019s an unnatural waterway, altered by human design. In the near-west suburbs, just before its plunges into the Forest Park tubes and becomes a sewer line, the river is often bound by concrete. When it re-emerges above ground after the park, it\u2019s a wide, V-shaped drainage canal. A Works Progress Administration project built during the New Deal, the channel replaced the old, natural riverbed. Most days, the broad channel has only a trickle of water in it\u2014a mix of standing rainwater and the remnants of the last storm\u2019s sewer overflows. The only time it really looks like a river is after heavy storms, when water can back up the tributary from the surging Mississippi River. As unsightly as the river is, people come into contact with the River des Peres often. No one swims in it, but a bike path runs along a stretch of it. Houses back up to it. \u201cIt\u2019s just an empty big huge ditch,\u201d says Hoelscher, \u201cthat birds, ducks and kids like to play in.\u201d\n\nForest Park, St. Louis's 1,370-acre public park, is filled with lakes for fishing and historical attractions such as the Missouri History Museum (right). | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine\n\nIt\u2019s not as bad as it was in the 1980s, when residents often called it the River de Pew because of its stench. In the 1990s and 2000s, even before the EPA came calling, MSD spent $2.3 billion to cut its number of sewer overflow points regionwide from about 700 to about 400. But the River des Peres channel is still a health hazard. A kid playing, or an adult picking up trash, could be exposed to E. coli and other bacteria common in human waste.\n\nSo this is where MSD will build most of its tunnels. In 2020, it\u2019ll start Project Clear\u2019s biggest single project, the nine-mile-long, 30-foot-wide, $630 million Lower & Middle River des Peres Storage Tunnel. The behemoth will run under the River des Peres from the Forest Park tubes\u2019 outflow to near the Lemay treatment plant on the Mississippi. It\u2019ll capture up to 206 million gallons of combined sewer overflow after storms. In 2024, MSD plans to start a two-mile tunnel under some River des Peres tributaries. In 2028, it\u2019s agreed to start another 9,000-foot tunnel to capture overflows that now go into the Upper River des Peres in University City. For those projects, tunnel-boring machines, rather than explosives, will handle most of the work.\n\nOnce it\u2019s all done, Project Clear is supposed cut the number of overflows a year into the River des Peres from about 50 to about four. The total volume of overflows should fall 80 percent, to about 1.2 billion gallons a year. It\u2019s not perfect, but no city\u2019s combined-sewer project is. The rule of thumb in overflow control and tunnel-building is that the costs escalate fast the farther you push toward zero and try to contain the flow from the very heaviest storms.\n\nAt a height of 630 ft. the Gateway Arch is the tallest monument in the United States. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine\n\nAnd, unfortunately, the price will keep spiking for St. Louis homeowners. Average sewer rates will hit $44 per month this year, $61 a month in 2020, and possibly as much as $90 a month in the mid-2020s. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to find how to lower the next set of rates,\u201d says Hoelscher. Smart financing helps some. In 2016, area voters approved the sale of bonds to fund Project Clear. MSD is also the biggest user of the state of Missouri\u2019s revolving loan fund.\n\nThe consent decree will set MSD\u2019s priorities until 2035. The proposed cuts to the EPA in the Trump administration\u2019s proposed fiscal year 2018 budget will affect St. Louis only indirectly, if at all. The proposal includes a 37 percent cut to the EPA\u2019s civil enforcement division, which takes local governments and businesses to court, and a 12 percent cut in compliance monitoring. \u201cIt\u2019s going to cripple the ability of EPA to move forward with more enforcement on CSOs,\u201d warns Amanda Waters, general counsel of the National Association of Clean Water Agencies. Cuts like that could slow the EPA\u2019s efforts to get the last few major holdout cities under combined-sewer consent decrees.\n\nOnce a consent decree is signed, it\u2019s hard to change\u2014as the Trump administration is discovering in the realm of police reform. A federal judge recently approved Baltimore\u2019s police consent decree, negotiated by the Obama administration, despite the Trump administration\u2019s attempt to delay it. Likewise, even an EPA less friendly to regulation can\u2019t change existing clean-water decrees easily. \u201cA judge has the responsibility to oversee that decree for the life of it,\u201d Waters says. \u201cYou\u2019d have to go back to the judge, and explain why [changing it is the] right thing.\u201d\n\nBut a weaker EPA could make it harder to cities like St. Louis to renegotiate their decrees to fit changing technologies\u2014for example, to substitute more green infrastructure for gray. \u201cThis is the part that concerns me the most about these cuts,\u201d says Waters, \u201cfor our existing members who need to be able to adapt their decrees to match the times.\u201d", "title": "How a Sewer Will Save St. Louis", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['St. Louis']"}, {"id": 394, "city": "['Las Vegas']", "url": "https://lasvegassun.com/news/2019/sep/03/county-sales-tax-for-water-projects-is-extended-in/", "text": "County sales tax for water projects is extended indefinitely\n\nA quarter-cent sales tax raising $100 million annually for water and wastewater projects will remain in place indefinitely following a decision Tuesday by the Clark County Commission.\n\nThe tax, which was approved by voters by a significant margin in 1998, has raised more than $1.4 billion over the last two decades. The 6-1 vote removes a sunset clause that would have made the tax expire in 2025. Officials from the Southern Nevada Water Authority, Clark County Water Reclamation District and other water and wastewater agencies say the tax has been vital in funding reliable water systems.\n\nProceeds from the tax have been put toward things like funding new treatment facilities, funding the debt service of North Las Vegas\u2019 water reclamation facility and debt service for a waterline connecting Boulder City to the River Mountains Water Treatment Plant.\n\nJohn Restrepo, an independent economist with RCG Economics, said maintaining the sales tax is important for maintaining a stable revenue source for Southern Nevada\u2019s water and wastewater facilities.\n\n\u201cThe tax base in Nevada is somewhat limited and not as broad-based as we\u2019d like it to be,\u201d he said. \u201cFrom an economic and water security standpoint, it makes sense to keep this important piece of the pie.\u201d\n\nBut some critics, like resident Ed Uehling, said the tax is \u201cregressive\u201d and that it \u201cspits in the face of low-income people.\u201d\n\nUehling added that SNWA operates like a business taking money away from the public.\n\n\u201cThis agency has a product to sell and can easily create a lot more money by acting like a business instead of what\u2019s being presented,\u201d he said.\n\nCommissioner Tick Segerblom was the sole naysayer on the vote.

Together, they are calling themselves the PCI Private Business Group. The group released a statement supporting the pollution testing plan and has agreed to help pay the $14 million price tag.\n\nThe new agreement outlines how the entire Portland Harbor site will be tested for pollutants. It includes testing river sediment, surface water and fish tissue for contaminants such as carcinogenic polychlorinated biphenyls or PCBs.\n\nThe resulting map of pollution at the site will help pinpoint exactly how much cleanup action will be needed to meet the EPA's cleanup targets. Cleaning up the site will involve dredging the river to remove contaminated soil and covering contaminated areas with clean soil, among other actions.\n\nFindings from the pollution sampling will also be used to determine which parties will pay for what portion of the massive $1 billion cleanup.\n\nThe new plan is a key step in the Portland Harbor cleanup process.\n\nEPA Administrator Scott Pruitt released a statement saying he's proud of the progress the agency has made since releasing a final cleanup plan for the Portland Harbor site early this year.\n\nTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor\n\n\"We are committed to keeping up the momentum,\u201d Pruitt said. \u201cBy cooperating with the state, the tribal nations, other federal partners and the responsible parties, we will keep the cleanup moving toward our shared goals of reducing risks to people and the environment, and returning the Lower Willamette to a healthier and more vital working waterway for all.\u201d\n\nThe EPA recently announced that Portland Harbor is one of 21 priority Superfund sites across the country targeted for \"immediate and intense attention.\" The Northwest's other priority-listed Superfund site is a former creosote operation on the shore of Lake Washington in Renton, Washington.\n\nEPA Superfund Task Force Chair visited Portland last week to help explain what that means, though many community groups and public agencies still had questions after he left.\n\nOfficials say updated pollution testing is needed because contamination levels may have changed as the site has slowly made its way through the Superfund cleanup planning process over the past 16 years.\n\nIn October, the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality raised concerns that the state and tribes were left out of the agreement negotiations and that the pollution sampling plan would ultimately weaken and delay the cleanup.\n\nComments from the state and tribal groups were subsequently incorporated into the agreement, but according to DEQ project manager Sarah Greenfield the state still sees gaps in the final pollution sampling plan.\n\n\"DEQ thinks we are getting a lot of data that we need, but we\u2019re not getting all the data,\" Greenfield said.\n\nThe final plan includes sampling smallmouth bass for contamination but it doesn't plan on sampling other fish species such as carp.

However, she said the agreement finalized Tuesday was not necessarily the only agreement the EPA will make for pollution testing at Portland Harbor.\n\nAccording to the agreement, pollution sampling will be coordinated by two contractors, AECOM and Geosyntec, with a goal of wrapping up in the fall of 2019.", "title": "Agreement Sets Pollution Testing Plan For Portland Harbor Superfund Site", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Portland']"}, {"id": 396, "city": "['San Antonio']", "url": "https://sanantonioreport.org/high-ozone-air-pollution-levels-expected-to-hit-san-antonio-this-week/", "text": "Levels of ozone pollution in San Antonio are expected to spike to harmful levels and remain that way for the rest of the week, according to air quality forecasts.\n\n\n\nThe Texas Commission on Environmental Quality has declared ozone action days in San Antonio for Wednesday and Thursday, largely because of regional weather patterns. The state agency is predicting that pollution will stay at levels considered \u201cunhealthy for sensitive groups\u201d through Saturday.\n\n\n\nOzone forms when air pollution from power plants, industrial sites, and vehicle exhaust reacts with volatile chemicals from sources like gasoline and paint in the presence of sunlight. The pollutant has been tied to chronic lung conditions such as asthma, and high enough levels can cause severe symptoms.\n\nThe poor air quality comes on the heels of a cold front that\u2019s bringing cooler-than-average summer temperatures to much of Texas, which should, in theory, promote better air quality, not worse. But local conditions and regional wind patterns actually are making higher ozone levels more likely, Brian McGovern, a TCEQ spokesperson, explained in an email.\n\n\n\nFor San Antonio, high temperatures are likely to remain in the 90s, \u201cwhich is plenty warm enough to contribute to efficient ozone production,\u201d McGovern said. After the cold front departs, a ridge of high pressure is expected to remain over Texas that will result in sinking air, light to moderate winds, and clear skies, \u201call of which are conducive for ozone formation,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nMcGovern said that some of this ozone will be blowing in from elsewhere.\n\n\n\n\u201cContinental air from the central and southern plains is expected to filter in behind the cold front,\u201d he continued. \u201cThis area had been experiencing high pressure, light winds, and hot temperatures, all of which contribute to the elevated ozone background levels that are now being transported into Texas.\u201d\n\nDallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Austin, and El Paso also are expected to have high ozone levels this week, according to the TCEQ.\n\n\n\nSan Antonio\u2019s ozone issues have drawn more attention recently after the EPA last July declared the city\u2019s long-term ozone levels too high to meet federal health standards. The designation has brought stricter state and federal scrutiny on San Antonio\u2019s air quality, though so far it has not brought the kind of onerous regulations that some have feared.\n\n\n\nThis week\u2019s high ozone levels could hamper the region\u2019s ability to meet specific clean air standards by the December 2020 deadline, which would place more stringent regulations on business and transportation planners.\n\nHowever, those who will feel the most immediate effects of this week\u2019s ozone spike will be \u201cchildren and especially children with respiratory conditions; the elderly and adults with lung diseases,\u201d said Adelita Cantu, an associate professor of nursing at UT Health San Antonio.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe impact of breathing ground-level ozone for a number of days includes chest pain, coughing, sore throat, [and] airway inflammation,\u201d Cantu said in an email. \u201cLongterm, it could result in lung damage. And most importantly, it can exacerbate existing health problems asthma, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and cardiac issues, particularly for people that work outdoors.\u201d\n\n\n\nCantu said avoiding ozone impact means staying indoors and limiting outside activity.\n\n\n\n\u201cFor students, this may increase school absences,\u201d she said. \u201cFor all age groups, this may increase visits to providers and emergency rooms and hospital admissions.\n\n\u201cIt is important that our policymakers understand that ground-level ozone is what we call an \u2018upstream issue\u2019 that \u2018downstream\u2019 causes many health problems for all ages.

People should also consider mass transit options like using the VIA bus system or car- or van-pooling.\u201d\n\n\n\nSecond, wait to refuel until after 6 p.m., when the sun begins to sink.\n\n\u201cEveryone can help limit the amount of gasoline vapors reacting with sunlight by filling up near sunset or by waiting until after an ozone action day to fill up,\u201d Ambriz said.\n\nAmbriz said that Metro Health also is engaging in several programs aimed at lowering Bexar County\u2019s overall ozone levels. These include working with a team at Bexar County\u2019s Public Works Department to encourage construction workers to idle their equipment less.\n\n\n\nMetro Health also is trying to encourage businesses to help reduce emissions by getting their employees to drive and idle less, he said.", "title": "High Ozone Air Pollution Levels Expected To Hit San Antonio This Week", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "['air_quality']", "annot_city": "['San Antonio']"}, {"id": 397, "city": "['Sacramento']", "url": "http://blogs.edf.org/energyexchange/2018/10/25/sacramento-leads-by-example-on-cleaner-energy-with-help-from-electrification/", "text": "Good news for California\u2019s clean energy fans. Last week the Board of Directors of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) approved an aggressive new plan that will help push California\u2019s capitol city and its surrounding area closer to meeting, and beating, the state\u2019s deep carbon reduction goals. Once implemented, SMUD will help create a cleaner energy and transportation system for the region.\n\nThe importance of SMUDs proposed investment shouldn\u2019t be understated, nor should its impact. Between now and 2040, the utility plans to invest nearly $7 billion toward projects that generate renewable energy and help switch consumers\u2019 energy use away from fossil fuels like natural gas and gasoline. This powerful commitment goes above and beyond the greenhouse gas reforms required by the state, and will enable the region to be net zero for climate pollution in a little more than 20 years.\n\nA move towards electrification\n\nSacramento\u2019s commitment to cut climate pollution from its energy system is certainly worth celebrating, and it\u2019s also an opportunity to demonstrate how the transition toward electrification can help rethink energy use in other parts of the state and country as well. In recent years new technologies have entered the market that make it cheaper and more efficient for consumers to do things like replace gas-powered water and space heaters with heating technology that can run on wind and solar power. Under new California laws like AB 3232 (Friedman) the California Energy Commission (CEC) and is now examining the potential to reduce climate pollution from residences and commercial buildings through strategies like electrification \u2013 meaning SMUD\u2019s going to be helping Sacramento, and California, learn while it is also leading by example.\n\nWhy is SMUD going big on shifting local consumers to electricity? Electrification initiatives like this are critical to helping communities decrease their demand for fossil fuels in everyday life \u2013 in both buildings where we work and live and in the transportation choices we make. And, based on scenarios run by the CEC, they are an integral part of meeting deep carbon reduction goals between now and 2050.\n\nThrough electrification, utilities like SMUD can not only bring more renewable-powered heating technologies to the consumers, they can cut local greenhouse gases and improve air quality. The SMUD plan, for example, helps reduce a projected 65% of local GHG emissions. When evaluated in the context of natural gas\u2019 linkage to emissions of methane due to gas system malfunctions and leaks, (methane is a potent greenhouse gas responsible for about 25 percent of current global warming), actions like SMUD\u2019s become even more urgent because they integrate solutions that decrease overall use of gas.\n\nFinding value in energy data\n\nAdoption of SMUD\u2019s newest investment plan is a smart move at the right time. Electric-powered technologies have never been more affordable, and the Big Data movement has paved the way for smart appliances and vehicles that can communicate directly with the energy grid \u2013 essentially allowing users to capitalize their energy usage at times when it is at its cheapest and cleanest. Therefore, this tech is critical not only for keeping electricity rates low and helping integrate more renewable energy into the grid, but also for curbing emissions associated with electric generation and use at the same time. SMUD has a major opportunity to capitalize on this trend by making energy data more transparent and available in order to help customers keep their rates low.\n\nThis investment by Sacramento\u2019s public utility, SMUD, reflects a growing consensus among the public and the science community that we need to do more to minimize the climate impacts of our energy and transportation systems. All utilities will be exploring options to meet California\u2019s ambitious and necessary climate goals, and as a result they should be looking to examples of visionary companies making sound investment choices. SMUD\u2019s plan certainly fits that bill and presents another milestone for California on its march toward carbon neutrality.", "title": "Sacramento leads by example on cleaner energy with help from electrification", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "['energy']", "annot_city": "['Sacramento']"}, {"id": 398, "city": "['Orlando']", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/30/business/energy-environment/orlando-carbon-climate.html", "text": "ORLANDO, Fla. \u2014 This city has long been a leading tourist destination.

Orlando is the largest city in Florida committing to this goal so far, according to the Sierra Club , with St. Petersburg and Sarasota right behind. Aside from combating climate change and pollution, the city argues the move toward renewable energy increases economic opportunities in Central Florida by creating local jobs in the industry. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer didn't call out the climate change aversion of President Donald Trump or the Republican-led Florida Legislature by name, but did say city mayors had to lead the fight against rising seas and increasing temperatures.\"This administration has decided not to honor our commitment to the Paris climate accord, but a lot of mayors around the country have picked up the reins to say if we're not doing it at the federal level, it's incumbent that we lead at the local level,\" Dyer says. \"More than 50 percent of the world's population now lives in cities, so we have to be the ones that are leading on the important issues that are of consequence for not just this year, but for decades and even centuries to come.\"Chris Castro, director of sustainability for the city, says over the last decade, Orlando has been trying to move the needle through its Green Works Orlando initiative to become one of the most sustainable cities in the Southeast. The city has already committed to reducing 90 percent of its air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 in accord with the Paris Climate Agreement. To achieve this, Orlando has already set a goal of powering 100 percent of municipal operations using renewable energy by 2030. Last year, the U.S. Department of Energy and the Solar Foundation declared Orlando a \"SolSmart City\" for its leadership on expanding clean energy sources.\"The power from the sun is cheaper to produce electricity than the power from fossil fuels, including coal and even natural gas,\" Castro says. \"What we want to do is maintain the affordability of our electricity rates. A lot of people think that just by going solar, it's going to be more expensive, and that is not the case. We're actually going to be able to levelize our cost of power over decades, and we'll be able to maintain the affordability and the reliability of our power here in the City of Orlando.\"The council is also particularly interested in the potential employment opportunities created by having this commitment to clean energy. Castro says last year in Florida, solar jobs grew 10 times faster than the overall state economy, adding 1,700 new jobs. Commissioner Sam Ings proposed moving the citywide goal of 100 percent renewable energy to 2035, and Castro said that target could be updated as more technology comes along.The resolution was applauded by members of the First 50 Coalition, a broad alliance pushing for local sustainability issues that includes the League of Women Voters of Orange County, the Sierra Club and FL SUN.\"I see this vote as historic and a first step toward what we can do in leadership on the national stage,\" says Sara Isaac, director of partnerships for the League. \"I think that you are sending a signal across the nation of the kind of city Orlando wants to be.\"In a statement, Phil Compton from the Sierra Club\u2019s Ready for 100 Campaign in Florida also praised the decision by Orlando commissioners.\"All across our state and our nation, cities are committing to a future powered by 100 percent clean and renewable energy for all,\" Compton says. \"Today, Orlando joins this growing movement of cities that are ready for 100 percent clean, renewable energy.\"", "title": "Orlando commits to 100 percent renewable energy citywide by 2050", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "['energy', 'sustainability']", "annot_city": "['Orlando']"}, {"id": 400, "city": "['Cleveland']", "url": "https://insideclimatenews.org/news/21092018/cleveland-100-percent-renewable-energy-cities-map-climate-change-plan-industrial-history", "text": "Cleveland, Ohio, which has worked for years to reinvent itself as it sheds its industrial past, has become the latest major city to announce plans to shift to 100 percent renewable energy sources for electricity.\n\nThe plan stands out in a state that in recent years has been more inclined to roll back clean energy rules than strengthen them, and in a territory served by FirstEnergy, which has been a leading burner of fossil fuels.\n\nCity officials announced the 100 percent renewable power target Thursday as they released an update to Cleveland's climate action plan, which aims to reduce greenhouses gases to 80 percent below the 2010 level by 2050.\n\nSign up for InsideClimate News Weekly Our stories.

Every weekend.\n\nThe plan discusses cutting emissions through improvements in energy efficiency and building design; developing more renewable energy within the city and region, including offshore wind power in Lake Erie; and increasing the use of public transportation and access to electric vehicle charging to reduce fossil fuel use.\n\nIt sets a 2050 deadline for getting to 100 percent renewable electricity. But there are no details about how the city will work with its local utilities to implement the plan, an omission that raised concerns among some environmental advocates.\n\nCleveland Mayor Frank Jackson said in a letter introducing the report that local leadership on climate is needed more than ever since President Trump announced he was pulling the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement.\n\n\"This plan is about much more than climate change,\" Jackson said. \"Implementing the actions in this plan will create a more sustainable Cleveland. By strengthening our economy, cleaning our environment, and improving the health and wellness of Clevelanders, we are building a thriving green city on a blue lake.\"\n\nTransforming a Former Industrial Stronghold\n\nCleveland is where John D. Rockefeller and a partner incorporated Standard Oil in 1870, and where steel production and other heavy industry formed the city's economic backbone for decades. Heavy industry also took a heavy toll on the city, with pollution that became so problematic it led to a notorious 1969 fire on the Cuyahoga River.\n\nWith the decline of heavy industry, Cleveland's population fell. Now, city leaders hope to make clean energy one its drivers of economic growth.\n\n\"The business case for energy efficiency and green buildings is strong,\" the plan says. \"They have lower utility and maintenance costs, less risk from energy price volatility, increase property values, improve health and productivity of occupants, create local jobs, and much more.\" It also highlights renewable energy jobs, including in manufacturing of wind turbines and battery storage.\n\nCleveland released its first climate plan in 2013. The latest version talks about the health and property damage risks to the region, citing Environmental Protection Agency data showing more frequent heat waves, heavy downpours occuring twice as often as they did a century ago, and annual temperatures in the Midwest on pace to rise 3 degrees Fahrenheit over the next few decades. To help combat climate change, the report calls for a 40 percent reduction in city emissions compared to 2010 levels by 2030 and 80 percent by 2050.\n\nThe city has a long way to go, however. In 2016, emissions were down only 2 percent from 2010, the report says.\n\nWill Utilities Go Along with the Plan?\n\nThe goals are laudable but the deadline is not ambitious enough, said Sandy Buchanan, the Cleveland-based executive director of the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a nonprofit clean-energy research group.\n\n\"They seem out of step with advancements in the global electricity market\" which would allow for a more rapid transition, she said.\n\nAlso, she notes that there are almost no details about how the 100 percent renewable energy pledge will be met. She would like to see specifics about how the city's two main utilities, FirstEnergy and Cleveland Public Power, would adjust their practices to make it possible for the Cleveland to meet the goals.\n\nThe city government controls Cleveland Public Power, but not FirstEnergy. Mark Durbin, a FirstEnergy spokesman, said his company was not part of the discussions that led to Cleveland's commitment.\n\nOhio's Shifting Views on Clean Energy\n\nOhio's state government has had an on again, off again relationship with renewable energy. The state took a big step forward on clean energy with a 2008 law that set requirements for renewable energy and energy efficiency, but the state has taken steps backwards since then with a weakening of the clean-energy standards and new restrictions on where wind turbines can be placed.\n\nIn the absence of state action, clean-energy advocates have been focusing on Ohio's cities, such as Cincinnati and Columbus.\n\nColumbus \"is considering the feasibility of several pathways to get to 100 percent electricity from renewable sources,\" said Robin Davis, spokeswoman for Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther. She said it's possible a goal of 100 percent renewable energy could be folded into its planning underway on a climate plan.\n\nCleveland now joins a list of 82 U.S. cities that have made pledges to get to 100 percent renewable energy, according to the Sierra Club's Ready for 100 campaign.", "title": "100% Renewable Energy: Cleveland Sets a Big Goal as It Sheds Its Fossil Fuel Past", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "['energy', 'sustainability']", "annot_city": "['Cleveland']"}, {"id": 401, "city": "['Pittsburgh']", "url": "https://www.publicsource.org/pittsburgh-is-no-longer-a-smoky-city-but-that-doesnt-mean-it-has-cleaned-up-its-act/", "text": "In its bid to host Amazon\u2019s second headquarters, Pittsburgh\u2019s weakest attribute may be its sustainability.\n\n\u201cAmazon has made a commitment to use 100 percent renewable energy in all of its operations,\u201d says Jim Spencer, CEO of EverPower, a windpower company based in Pittsburgh.

He asked the audience to raise their hands if it was their first time to Pittsburgh. \u201cKeep your hands up if you were expecting old rusty steel mills,\u201d he said. \u201cThe rest of you are lying. The nice thing about Pittsburgh, there are not great expectations.\u201d\n\nThis is the paradox of Pittsburgh\u2019s current environmental identity: The city is claiming the role of environmental leader but still touts its success relative to its dirty past.\n\nAmazon may not care about how much greener the city is than it used to be. It wants a green city, full stop.\n\nSo how green is Pittsburgh?\n\nGetting beyond the past\n\nThe deficits of its past remain daunting \u2014 with billions of dollars needed to continue remediating overflowing sewers, lead pipes, brownfield contamination and more. The air quality still ranks among the nation\u2019s worst near industrial polluters, such as the Clairton Coke Works, which was fined $1 million by the Allegheny County Health Department this summer for ongoing violations in the air quality agreement. But, overall, the air quality continues to improve, and planned upgrades to the sewer system over the next decade should make the rivers cleaner than they\u2019ve been in generations.\n\nShare tips, ideas & your personal stories related to Pittsburgh news.\n\n\n\nYour email:\n\nSend\n\nYet part of what it means to be a green city today is distinct from cleaning up the pollution of the past.\n\nThe biggest environmental challenge of the present is climate change, according to scientists at the United Nations and the only way to address it is for people to stop producing so many greenhouse gas emissions. Major cities such as New York and Washington, D.C., have reduced their greenhouse gas emissions by 15 and 23 percent since 2005-2006, and even cities with fewer resources, such as St. Louis and San Diego, have seen their emissions drop.\n\nThere isn't a consistent time period all cities are using to measure their greenhouse gas emissions. During the only period measured in Pittsburgh, 2003 to 2013, carbon emissions increased by about 10 percent, despite efforts to curb them.\n\nAlissa Burger, a senior policy adviser with the Pennsylvania Environmental Council, says the city needs to start comparing itself to Seattle and Boston, not its industrial counterparts of the past. \u201cIt is going to get us further than comparing us to Cleveland,\u201d she says. \u201cJust because they are our rival in football doesn\u2019t mean they are a rival when it comes to decarbonization.\u201d\n\nPittsburgh can\u2019t escape its geography or its past \u2014 an urban center in a region rich with coal and, more recently, discovered to be sitting in one of the largest natural gas plays in the world.\n\nAs time goes on, though, cities like Pittsburgh will not only continue to be judged by environmentalists, corporations and potential residents alike on traditional measures of pollution but also on how green its energy is. Many climate scientists believe everything that runs on fossil fuels, like cars, needs to eventually run on electricity. And the electricity itself needs to become much cleaner. This could be a significant opportunity to grow a green energy industry.\n\n\u201cJust because they are our rival in football doesn\u2019t mean they are a rival when it comes to decarbonization.\u201d\n\nLeaders in Pittsburgh often cite the more than 8,000 clean energy jobs already here. But many of those jobs are not full time or are not truly new. The definition of a green job is any job where more than 0 percent of the work has a green component. The latest data suggests Allegheny County added 4,000 additional clean energy jobs last year but it\u2019s not clear if these are new jobs or old jobs that have incorporated a component of clean energy work.\n\nThe job numbers are slightly misleading. The report labels any job with even just a day\u2019s worth of green energy work as a green energy job. This could include an energy salesman who sells mostly ordinary energy policies but has renewable offerings, or a roofer who spends some time installing solar panels but is usually installing traditional roofs.\n\nFor example: When considering only those jobs where at least half of the day\u2019s work involves green energy, the number of solar jobs decreases by about a third in Pennsylvania and the nation at large. Even fewer workers spend 100 percent of their day working in solar.\n\nMost of those green energy jobs are construction jobs, according to Philip Jordan, vice president of BW Research Partnership, whose company performed the research. And, according to Jordan, Pennsylvania is actually slightly below average at creating green energy jobs.\n\nIf the city does have an advantage, some experts think it could lie in turning one of its biggest deficits \u2014 its old buildings \u2014 into its most powerful resource. About 80 percent of the city\u2019s climate emissions come from the poor energy-efficiency of its buildings.\n\nThe city has already taken steps in a major energy efficiency initiative and, with more investment, could become a leader in the country\u2019s push for energy efficiency. Some local experts think that developing and installing more efficient lighting, better insulation and other tighter building standards could be the area\u2019s best hope for a green future.\n\nTwo years ago, Grant Ervin, chief resilience officer for the City of Pittsburgh, began planning for how the city would respond to climate change. He says he repeatedly heard two major fears: One was about the closure of the Beaver Valley nuclear plant because of how much greenhouse gas-free energy it provided. The other concern was over a substantial increase in industrial production, such as what is expected to come from Shell's new Beaver County ethane cracker plant and others still to come.\n\nNow, both worst-case scenarios appear to be imminent.\n\nRenewable energy\n\nJane Miller and her husband, Mike Kissel, had a leak in the roof of their Edgewood home last year. Instead of a simple patch, the couple installed a new metal roof this year and then hired local solar company, EIS Solar, to install 15 solar panels. It\u2019s enough to provide about 70 percent of the home\u2019s electricity over the course of the year.\n\nThe Millers\u2019 $20,000 investment in solar panels is just the sort of commitment that the city needs from its residents, landlords and business owners. Most people can\u2019t afford to drastically reduce their carbon footprint immediately, so as big expenses come up, the city needs people to start replacing their cars and furnaces with greener choices.\n\nThe Millers\u2019 solar panels would\u2019ve cost three times as much and provided a third less electricity back in 2009, when EIS Solar was just starting out. Now, the Millers can expect their investment to pay for itself in about a decade.\n\nHow green energy should look in Pittsburgh isn\u2019t clear yet, though. Should it come from a solar farm in North Carolina (where about half of Pennsylvania\u2019s solar comes from) or on roofs in the city\u2019s own backyards? Maybe it should be solar and wind or some other mix.\n\nIn 2009, President Barack Obama heralded Pittsburgh as a center of \u201cgreen technology\u201d and, at the time, there was much to be excited about. Pennsylvania was heavily subsidizing solar energy and the installation of solar panels spiked.\n\nThe subsidies ended a few years later, and many of the solar companies left or went bankrupt. It\u2019s not only solar energy that has stagnated.\n\nIn 2004, the state set a 2021 goal that 8 percent of its energy would come from renewables. It seemed ambitious then. The state is already buying 6.5 percent renewable energy, and there is more than enough wind energy available to meet the 8 percent goal now. So only one new wind farm has been built in Pennsylvania since 2012. Without raising the bar, progress has stalled.\n\nSolar and wind energy make up less than 8 percent of the nation\u2019s electricity but they have been growing 10 times as fast as fossil fuels since 2000.\n\nPennsylvania passed a bill this year that will require future renewables to be purchased locally, about 0.5 percent of which needs to be solar by 2021. California, by contrast, passed legislation in May that will require all new homes to include solar panels or be served by solar panels in the neighborhood; it takes effect in two years.\n\nHere, EIS Solar\u2019s current business depends largely on the good intentions of people like the Millers, says Brian Krenzelak, an employee who installed the panels. It also depends on workers like his colleague, Scott Ferrari-Adler, who says he took a pay cut from a sheet metal job to work in an industry he believes in.\n\nThe number of renewable energy jobs is frequently used to persuade the public that going green can also mean earning green. Peduto and Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald cite a study that says there are 70,000 such jobs in Pennsylvania, and Allegheny County leads the way with more than 8,000. (The latest data from June shows 86,000 and 12,000 jobs, respectively, but the political rhetoric hasn\u2019t yet caught up to the new numbers.)\n\nFossil fuels still dominate locally: There were more than 40,000 fossil fuel jobs in Pennsylvania in 2017, five times as many as in solar and wind. In the country as a whole, there are twice as many fossil fuel jobs as jobs in solar or wind. In places such as California, where the state does more to promote renewable energy, there are about twice as many jobs in renewable energy as fossil fuels.\n\nWhere are the green energy jobs?\n\nThere are a few reasons the region is lagging behind in green job creation. Among them is that there isn\u2019t a lot of sun or wind in southwestern Pennsylvania, and the cost of electricity is cheaper than in places such as California or Massachusetts. So it takes people like the Millers much longer to break even on their investment.\n\nThe Keystone Energy Efficiency Alliance has highlighted the local Sheet Metal Workers union in Pittsburgh for its energy efficiency training. Keith Schettler, training coordinator at the union, says sheet metal workers used to do more work in solar energy before government funding was cut in 2012. Now, a focus has been on teaching \u201clagging,\u201d a skill that will be needed to seal the aluminum piping at the new Shell cracker plant in Beaver County.\n\nFossil fuels still dominate locally: There were more than 40,000 fossil fuel jobs in Pennsylvania in 2017 , five times as many as in solar and wind.\n\nWhile most green energy laws are created at the state and federal levels, cities such as Pittsburgh aren\u2019t powerless. The Sierra Club has been trying to persuade cities to commit to 100 percent renewable energy, and Peduto has signed on in principle.\n\nSoon after Peduto\u2019s commitment in 2017, EverPower pitched the city on a new wind farm site that is ready to be developed near Somerset that could provide Pittsburgh with local green energy. Spencer, its founder and CEO, says that if renewables are going to be a substantial part of the energy mix here, then companies need long-term commitments from big buyers like the city.\n\n\"I think we\u2019ve made [the city] a pretty compelling offer,\u201d he says of the proposed 76 megawatts of electricity that 30 additional wind turbines could bring. \"There has just been little action.\u201d\n\nRight now, the city buys its energy in a consortium with the county, the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority and several other government agencies and nonprofits. The consortium purchases 35 percent renewable energy. But most of that is from green energy produced in other states. And the debate is just getting underway about how much green energy the consortium may buy locally in 2020, when it\u2019s next due to purchase energy.\n\nSo while \u201cwind farm technician\u201d is one of the fastest growing jobs across the country, there is little sign that those jobs will be coming to southwestern Pennsylvania any time soon.\n\nThe technicians at Twin Ridges, one of the last wind farms built in the state in 2012, say their jobs are some of the only well-paying jobs in their rural communities. The jobs require electrical or mechanical aptitude but not a specific degree, so they are highly sought after. But they\u2019re not for everyone. \u201cPeople really don\u2019t like heights,\u201d says John Pelar, one of the technicians.\n\nWe\u2019re not sexy\n\n\u201cOur goal is simple: We want to lead the world,\u201d Peduto said at an April 19 event touting how far Pittsburgh has come at reducing energy use in its buildings.\n\nJohn Quigley, former secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, echoed the sentiment at a committee hearing on renewable energy in 2016. Pennsylvania has the third oldest building stock in the country, he testified, and these old buildings represent a unique opportunity.\n\n\u201cEnergy efficiency is one of Pennsylvania's most abundant sources of energy\u2026,\u201d Quigley testified. \u201cAnd energy efficiency is, in fact, the energy resource that creates the most jobs.\u201d\n\nElectricity saved is, from the perspective of climate change, just as good as additional solar or wind power because both reduce the amount of greenhouse gases used.\n\nAbout 80 percent of the 70,000 green energy jobs in Pennsylvania are energy-efficiency jobs. (About a third of those jobs are in heating and air conditioning, making it unclear whether these are new jobs or modifications to how existing jobs are already performed.)\n\nSo before investing in renewable energy, Jordan of BW Research suggests Pittsburgh should do as much as it can to make its buildings more efficient.\n\nIt\u2019s just that energy efficiency isn\u2019t \u2026 sexy. Three energy experts said the same thing \u2014 \u201cit\u2019s not sexy\u201d \u2014 to explain why energy efficiency doesn\u2019t get the attention it deserves. \u201cPeople gravitate toward renewables,\u201d Jordan says. \u201cBut, in Pennsylvania, the opportunity is efficiency.\u201d\n\nThe 2030 District, an initiative of the Green Building Alliance in Pittsburgh, is frequently cited by the city for spearheading this work. The voluntary coalition of building owners is the largest such district in the country to commit to reducing its energy (and water) use 50 percent below 2003 levels by 2030.\n\nThe 2030 District progress is also a reminder of how daunting the challenges are. Five years ago, the district announced that it had reduced energy consumption by 11.6 percent in its first year. Five years later, the district announced that it has reduced its energy consumption by a total of 12 percent.\n\nWith about three times as many buildings participating now than at the start, the 2030 District faces a dual challenge: it needs to further reduce energy use in buildings that have already made the easiest changes, such as adding more efficient light bulbs, while adding buildings that need to make both easy and expensive changes.\n\nNew York City has decided it needs to take a more aggressive tact to reduce energy use in its old buildings. The mayor\u2019s office is pushing to make energy reductions mandatory, with large fines for building owners who don\u2019t comply.\n\n\u201cAs much as voluntary actions are needed, we are quickly getting to the point where we need to mandate what performance needs to look like,\u201d Mark Chambers, New York\u2019s director of sustainability, told a national green building conference in Pittsburgh in April.\n\nPittsburgh prefers to move forward without \u201clegislative hammers,\u201d says Angelica Ciranni, senior director of the 2030 District.\n\n\u201cWe always look to things happening in New York and California and say, \u2018Wouldn\u2019t that be nice?\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cI just don\u2019t know that there would be a lot of support for that locally, especially given the fact that so much progress is being made.\u201d\n\nToo lucrative to fail\n\nPittsburgh and Pennsylvania aren\u2019t leading the country at creating green energy, but they aren\u2019t at the bottom either. The solar industry has been recovering slowly and, although there has been very little wind power added, Pennsylvania still is among the top 20 states at producing wind power.\n\nBut one of its biggest environmental success stories is about to flip.\n\nOld coal-power plants, one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases, were being driven out of business, in large part, by the abundance of cheap natural gas. This contributed greatly to the United States getting halfway to its 2025 Paris Agreement goal to reduce its carbon footprint.\n\nHowever, the natural gas industry\u2019s success appears to be threatening the city\u2019s progress on climate change. FirstEnergy recently announced that, without government intervention, it plans to close several of its nuclear power reactors, including the one in Beaver Valley, which supplies Pittsburgh with 70 percent of its electricity. A recent paper out of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology showed that the biggest cause of nuclear plant closures like this one is the availability of cheap natural gas.\n\nNuclear power is by far the largest source of carbon-free energy in Pittsburgh. Gas is about twice as clean as coal, but it looks positively dirty compared to nuclear, which emits virtually no greenhouse gases.\n\nRight now, there isn\u2019t much demand for building more power plants of any kind, whether it\u2019s renewable, gas plants or any other. Electricity use has remained flat for more than a decade and PJM, which manages the 13-state region Pennsylvania is a part of, says there is already more electricity capacity than needed. So the gas industry is trying to sell more gas to homes in the state and then export the excess.\n\nThere is increasing demand for plastics, though. And the natural gas in the region isn\u2019t just plentiful, it\u2019s considered \u201cwet gas,\u201d the right type to make plastics. It\u2019s 30 percent cheaper to produce plastic resin here than on the Gulf Coast, according to David Ruppersberger, president of the Pittsburgh Regional Alliance, who spoke at an April energy innovation conference at Carnegie Mellon University.\n\nThat\u2019s why a recent report, commissioned by Chevron Appalachia and Peoples Natural Gas, predicted that the region could gain 100,000 jobs if it embraces policies that support gas production, cracker plants and the industries they will support.\n\nKevin Acklin, the mayor\u2019s former chief of staff who now works as chief legal counsel for Peoples, said at an April 24 energy forum at the Heinz History Center that developing natural gas and plastics could increase the size of the state\u2019s economy by 10 percent.\n\n\u201cAmazon set up this \u2018Hunger Games\u2019 competition among cities for us to compete for them to come here \u2026 But I would submit that the opportunity we have before us to transform this community is much, much larger if we get this right,\u201d Acklin says of the economic potential of the region\u2019s natural gas.\n\nAs Acklin spoke, a couple dozen protesters in the audience raised signs that said \u201cdirty.\u201d The environmentalists don\u2019t want the region to be defined by natural gas and plastics, much like it once was defined by coal and steel.\n\nIf the world is to avoid the greatest harms of climate change, climate scientists believe people are going to have to leave some fossil fuels in the ground.\n\nWith the second largest natural gas field in the world underneath it, our region\u2019s actions will have far-reaching consequences. Even some of the rosiest projections for adopting renewable energy include natural gas decades into the future.\n\nGov. Tom Wolf proposed using $200 million from a severance tax on natural gas to stimulate the construction of solar panels and wind installations and to improve energy efficiency. The idea is to use natural gas as a \u201cbridge fuel\u201d to a renewable future. But the proposal hasn\u2019t gained traction.\n\nJared Cohon, president emeritus at CMU, moderated an April 5 panel about traditional energy sources. Cohon, who recently received a lifetime achievement award by the Pennsylvania Environmental Council, acknowledges that fossil fuels, especially natural gas, will play a major role in the country\u2019s energy mix for a long time, even as many leaders are committed to reducing them. \u201cBut if you are going to use them, you want to use them wisely with maximum benefit.\u201d\n\nOliver Morrison is PublicSource\u2019s environment and health reporter.

It's because of logistical challenges, getting fresh produce, meat and dairy to people who need them most \u2014 or getting the people to sources of food \u2014 before it spoils.\n\nTake Todd Davis and Theresa McCalley of Walnut Hills, for example. They have an apartment on Oak Street, about three blocks from the Kroger grocery that closed in March 2017. The couple lives on a fixed income and in one of the city's most prominent food deserts.\n\n\"I don't drive, she don't drive, and them closing the store made it a lot harder on everybody,\" said Davis, who walked with McCalley on a recent Friday afternoon to buy vegetables and pasta at the Freestore Foodbank's Healthy Harvest Mobile Market. It pulled into the former Kroger parking lot along McMillan Street.\n\n\"Our building is mostly senior citizens. They can walk from their apartments for this,\" Davis said.\n\n'Rescuing' the food\n\nImproving healthy food options available in food deserts \u2013 defined as areas with a predominance of low-income residents who have limited access to affordable and nutritious food \u2013 is commanding a lot of attention locally these days.\n\nThe Soup Kitchen Summit formed a year ago and brings together soup kitchen operators, major social service agencies such as the Freestore Foodbank and Cincinnati's St. Vincent de Paul Society, philanthropy organizations and corporate partners, such as the Kroger Co., to find ways to work together to rescue more food and redistribute it more efficiently and quickly to people in need.\n\nNonprofit leaders in Walnut Hills and Avondale, another food desert neighborhood, are coming up with creative solutions to fill grocery spaces that are unlikely to ever be filled again by a traditional large store.\n\nCommunity gardens and neighborhood- and school-based cooking and nutrition classes have received renewed focus as part of the solution to food deserts and poor diets and negative health outcomes that often accompany them. No idea or effort, big or small, it seems, is being dismissed or disregarded.\n\n\"It's the dumbest problem we have on the planet,\" said Jeffrey Miller, chief operating officer of Cincinnati-based Last Mile Food Rescue, which seeks volunteers using apps to get food that would go to waste to big food pantries. The idea is derived from Food Rescue Hero of Pittsburgh, which was founded in 2016 and continues to be refined.\n\nVolunteers use an app that alerts them to a match between a food donation and a nonprofit who would like to receive it. They then \"rescue\u201d the food.\n\n\"Hunger in Cincinnati is solvable. It's just people learning how to not throw out food,\" Miller said.\n\nThe need is great. So is the opportunity.\n\n290,000 people, 80,000 of them children, are food insecure, the Freestore Foodbank estimates of its 20-county service region.\n\nthe Freestore Foodbank estimates of its 20-county service region. 6.6 million pounds of produce is distributed by the Freestore, enough food to make 27.3 million meals.

That comes out to almost 74 pounds of food wasted a year per person in the county.\n\nFood waste happens in many ways and to varying degrees, said Georgine Getty, executive director of Our Daily Bread.\n\n\"It's not eating a crust of bread to forgetting about the strawberries in the back of the refrigerator,\" she said. \"It's the vendors at Findlay Market preparing food for New Year's Eve, which ended up being really cold, and them needing to give it to us. On the largest scale, it's realizing that way too much food is sitting in the factory and is going to go to waste if they don't do something fast.\"\n\nSoup Kitchen Summit\n\nGetty is one of three chairs of the summit, which formed about a year ago to try to fix the problem, Getty said, \"that we had all these hungry people.\"\n\nIn a short time, however, its members realized \"we were part of something a lot bigger, an environmental problem, how do we save food that's being wasted and get it quickly to people who need it,\" she said.\n\nIts themes are:\n\nFood rescue. Sharing the most relevant information on community resources that lead to solving what summit members see as a \"logistics problem.\" Creating a system for distribution that is sustainable.\n\nGetting healthier food to people in need\n\nSeveral organizations in Greater Cincinnati are working to rescue and redistribute food. Among them:\n\nLast Mile: It recently partnered with United Way of Greater Cincinnati to tap into its volunteers who can serve as drivers, said Last Mile President and CEO Thomas Fernandez. \"They have lots of volunteers. We have a shared mission to fight poverty,\" he said. Last Mile is targeting its first deliveries for July 2019.\n\nFreshmen: Through a $10,000 People's Liberty Grant from the Haile Foundation, Eban Taylor seeks to fill a need at the grassroots level. Freshmen is a community delivery service that offers grocery pickup to Avondale residents limited by access to healthy food, reliable transportation and technology.\n\n\"Our shopping behavior in the grocery store is now starting to interact with some form of technology,\" Taylor said. \"How do we still continue to create these experiences for people who are on assistance, and how do we make sure that they get the same experience where they are not missing out on the benefit of a convenient service model, service, whether it be online grocery ordering or delivery.\"\n\nProduce Perks Midwest: The Sharonville-based organization is a regional nonprofit that helps people in underserved communities get access to healthy fruits and vegetables. Produce Perks provides a dollar for dollar match to those using SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) cards, which are honored by farmer's markets and grocery stores. Recipients can purchase up to $10 per day in grocery stores and $20 a day at farmer's markets.\n\nBloc Ministries: In Price Hill, Bloc is working with Cincinnati State Technical and Community College to train chefs who can cook at home and get a job with those skills.\n\nGabriel's Place: In Avondale, this food ministry offers a farmer's garden and cooking classes, among its other food-based programs.\n\nThose are smaller, community-based programs. Then there is a large-scale effort, the $10 million Zero Hunger/Zero Waste Innovation Fund, announced in February by Cincinnati-based Kroger Co. Foundation.\n\nInnovators sent in letters of intent on proposals to prevent food waste. Grants will be awarded that range from $25,000 to $250,000.\n\nThe goals are ambitious:\n\nAccelerate donations of nutritious food that provide 3 billion healthy meals by 2025.\n\nAdvocate for public solutions to address hunger and divert food waste from landfills.\n\nAchieve internally that Kroger will be a zero-waste company by 2020 and prevent all food waste within all of its stores by 2025.\n\nFood desert, Part I: Avondale\n\nAvondale has not had a grocery since Aldi closed in November 2008. Its departure left the neighborhood of 12,500 people, the largest predominantly African American community in the region \u2013 without a source of fresh, healthful food.\n\nA major component of the $29.5 million federal Choice Neighborhood grant of December 2012 was a grocery. Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley and city administration have promised a grocery in Avondale.\n\nNonprofit developer the Community Builders had a fully negotiated lease with Missouri-based grocery chain Save-A-Lot. But the lease was not signed because of a pending sale of the discount chain to a private equity investor that was finalized in October 2016.\n\nFor many years, corner stores have been the only sources of food in the neighborhood.\n\nCommunity Builders and its partners, including the Avondale Community Council, had to adjust on the fly. Development of the Avondale Town Center at the corner of Forest Avenue and Reading Road began in 2017 without a grocery plan.\n\nSlowly, though, it has taken shape. The vision is for a 15,000-square-foot grocer split into two spaces. Most of the space, about 9,000 square feet, will be a higher-end variety chain that will offer dry goods and benefit from professional on-site management and security. The adjacent 6,000 square feet with be a new concept that focuses solely on fresh produce, meat, baked goods and dairy products.\n\n\"The model is the old neighborhood butcher shop,\" said Jeff Beam, project manager for Community Builders. \"We're interested in customer loyalty, something that will establish the community-grocer relationship.\"\n\nMORE: Avondale Town Center rebuild set\n\nMORE: Avondale's 50-year recovery from riots\n\nThe variety store will open first, and Community Builders is close to signing a contract on that space, Beam said.\n\nThe grocery is part of 80,000 square feet of commercial space on the ground floors of two new buildings and 119 units of mixed-income housing \u2013 market rate, low-income and workforce rental, Beam said. A model is open. Agents are leasing apartments. Residents are beginning to move in.\n\nFood desert, Part II: Walnut Hills\n\nWhen the Walnut Hills Kroger shut its doors in March 2017, the area became a food desert that was particularly hard on senior citizens and low-income families that did not have a way to access the new Corryville Kroger about a mile and a half away.\n\n\"It crushed the neighborhood,\" said one resident, Todd Davis, who now gets his vegetables and fruit during a two-hour time slot on Friday afternoons from the Freestore Foodbank's Healthy Harvest Mobile Market.\n\nLemuel Israel is the market manager for the Freestore.\n\n\"Warmer weather brings more people out,\" Israel said as a couple of shoppers moved through the trailer, which offers refrigerated milk, eggs and juice, a full display of produce and even spices, spaghetti and marinara sauce.\n\n\"The people are heartfelt. They tell us thanks for caring and for being here.\"\n\nMORE: Kroger announces it will close in Walnut Hills\n\nMORE: Grant will lead to new Walnut Hills grocery\n\nNeighborhood leaders have tried a number of temporary solutions to bridge the gap between the Kroger closing and the expected opening later this year of a smaller grocery tailored to community needs, said Gary Dangel, Healthy Outreach Coordinator for the Walnut Hills Redevelopment Foundation and a Walnut Hills resident.\n\nThe smaller store, expected to be created in a 4,000-square-foot space near the former Kroger store \u2013 which was 33,000 square feet \u2013 received a major financial boost in June 2018 with receipt of a $100,000 grant from Gannett Co. Inc.'s A Community Thrives program. Gannett is the parent company of The Enquirer. Later in 2018, the neighborhood redevelopment foundation received another $100,000 grant to use toward the grocery project from the Aetna Foundation.\n\nBesides the mobile market, which visits Walnut Hills and nine other local food desert communities during a week \u2013 Walnut Hills is the most frequented stop, Dangel said \u2013 the neighborhood has brought in three different farmers' markets.\n\n\"Adaption had to happen,\" Dangel said. \"Besides losing a grocery store, we lost a social meeting place.\"\n\nThe new Walnut Hills grocery space will be similar to the one planned for the Avondale Town Center. It will focus on fresh food options: produce, meat, dairy and baked goods.\n\n\"We want it to be pedestrian scale,\" Dangel said. \"This is a walkable neighborhood.\"\n\nNew neighbors moving into Walnut Hills\n\nThe new grocery space also will offer community events, many of them food-related, such as cooking classes. It will benefit from other planned additions to the Peoples Corner area.\n\nTaste of Belgium will move its corporate headquarters and employee commissary to a space on McMillan Street.\n\nNearby will be the expanded headquarters of La Soupe, a nonprofit that will be moving into a 6,000-square-foot space. It will be moving from a 900-square-foot building on Red Bank Road in Anderson Township.\n\nCooking classes and food-based events for Walnut Hills residents and those living in neighboring communities are part of the plan for the new space, said La Soupe Board President Mimi Dyer, \"events that blur the lines between volunteers and the people who come to see us. We're moving into Walnut Hills purposely because it's a food desert.\"\n\nMORE: Here's how La Soupe turns potential waste into good food\n\nLa Soupe's focus is on food access. Beyond its food-rescue efforts that engage chefs, its programs create community cooking events, teach cooking and bring a van into neighborhoods under a \"pay-from-your-heart' model. Its food runners get leftovers to agencies such as Our Daily Bread, Anna Louise Inn and others who can use it before it goes bad. Its suppliers include Jungle Jim's, the Crossett Co., Kroger and local farmers. About 1,600 pints of soup are donated each week. It is frozen in donated ice cream containers.\n\n\"There is more than enough food,\" Dyer said. \"We try to make it as easy as possible to get food to the people who need it most.\"\n\nThose additions to the neighborhood can't come fast enough for nearby Walnut Hills residents Davis and Theresa McCalley.\n\nThey appreciate the Freestore's mobile market. They walked home north on Gilbert Avenue to their apartment on the recent Friday. They carried vegetable greens, bell peppers and pasta in their bag.\n\nThe plan was to cook up some vegetable pasta for dinner.\n\nMcCalley smiled, looked at Davis and said, \"His recipe.

The USDA defines food insecurity as a \u201chousehold-level economic and social condition of limited or uncertain access to adequate food.\u201d\n\nCommunity leaders came together Friday morning to discuss recent findings and efforts to address hunger at \"Hunger and Health: Time for Creative Intervention,\" an event presented by IBJ and Gleaners Food Bank of Indiana.\n\nThe event's purpose was to \u201creinforce the urgency of the call to action\u201d around hunger and \u201craise the solutions up,\u201d said Gleaners Food Bank President and CEO John Elliott.\n\nThe five members of the featured panel discussed in detail the links between hunger, health, education, transportation, employment and economic mobility.\n\nYour browser does not support the video tag.\n\n\n\n\u201cI think we have a false sense of security,\u201d said Virginia Caine, director of the Marion County Health Department. \u201cMarion County\u2019s unemployment rate is very, very low so [people think] we must be doing fantastic because most people have jobs.\u201d However, she said, many people are hungry because their jobs don't pay a living wage.\n\nFixing hunger would require more investment both money and volunteer manpower, according to the panelists. The Sagamore Institute estimates an $82-million-per-year shortfall in the investment needed to feed the county\u2019s entire food-insecure population.\n\n\u201cWe may think there\u2019s a lot of money being put out there, but it\u2019s not meeting the entire need,\u201d Caine said.\n\nBut not solving the issue is also costly. Paul Halverson, founding dean of the Indiana University Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health, estimated that poverty and hunger create $3 billion per year in additional economic costs in Indiana, from health care expenses to lost economic opportunities.\n\nThat money could be much better spent on preventive public health care, he said. Indiana is the 39th-healthiest state in the nation, according to the United Health Foundation. That\u2019s not a ranking we should be happy with, he said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an ironclad linkage between good health and good economic prosperity,\u201d Halverson said. \u201cWe need to recognize we can\u2019t have one without the other.\u201d\n\nSagamore Institute Vice President Troy Riggs urged the community to step up through volunteering to make progress on the issue.\n\n\u201cMoney sometimes is a Band-Aid,\u201d Riggs said. \u201cWe know what works. What it\u2019s going to take is not just money, but people being actively involved.\u201d\n\nThe panelists also drove home how hunger impacts the city\u2019s schools, hospitals and neighborhoods.\n\nIn the Indianapolis Public Schools system, about 70 percent of the students qualify for the federal free- and reduced-price-lunch program. Superintendent Lewis Ferebee said people often think hunger simply distracts students from learning because their stomachs are grumbling.\n\n\u201cActually, it\u2019s much more concerning than that,\u201d Ferebee said. \u201cStudents who do not receive regular nutritious food often have cognitive delays \u2026 that result in achievement challenges and learning disabilities in our schools.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s one of the reasons Ferebee\u2019s administration established a no-cost breakfast and lunch program for all students, and new programs to feed kids during academic breaks. But he said the school community still struggles with hunger because \u201cwe\u2019re not there over the evening and the weekends.\u201d\n\nIn hospitals, St. Vincent Health CEO Jonathan Nalli said, \u201cpoverty and other social determinants such as lack of transportation, lack of water, lack of food, play such an impactful role in diminishing health outcomes.\u201d\n\nNalli said, based on his organization\u2019s research, a food-insecure family incurs $1,800 more in health care expenditures each year than those who have food security.\n\n\u201cThat is a population that is going to quickly choose between food and health care expenditures and access to health care,\u201d Nalli said. \u201cAccess or lack of access to good food impacts any chance and ability for somebody with diabetes to get the right care and keep their diabetes under control.\u201d\n\nThe challenge has led St. Vincent to start a weekend feeding program, and to set up and expand food pantries in its emergency rooms. The doctors and nurses have also started asking patients if they have faced hunger or food insecurity during the last year, hoping that more data will allow them to better target resources and help hungry patients.\n\nPacers Sports & Entertainment Vice Chairman Jim Morris, who also is a former director of the United Nations World Food Programme, reminded the audience that \u201cthe burden of this issue generally falls on the backs of women and children.\u201d About a third of children in Indianapolis are considered to be below the poverty level.\n\n\u201cMy view of our city is, there\u2019s nothing more important than taking care of our children,\u201d Morris said. \u201cIf we take care of our kids, I believe everything else will take care of itself.\u201d", "title": "Food insecurity, hunger vex large swath of Indianapolis residents", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "['food']", "annot_city": "['Indianapolis']"}, {"id": 405, "city": "['Columbus']", "url": "https://radio.wosu.org/post/study-says-food-insecurity-columbus-much-worse-previously-thought#stream/0", "text": "Many people in Columbus are going hungry at times because they can\u2019t buy enough nutritious food to last through the month.

Virginia successfully competed against Florida, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Washington, DC for the project, which will create 1,110 new jobs with an average annual salary of $74,000.\n\n\u201cThis green energy manufacturing center is a long-standing dream we\u2019ve had at GTS,\u201d said Terry Spitzer, CEO of Global Technology Systems. \u201cHaving steadily grown our business since 1997, we\u2019ve continuously expanded our technical engineering competencies to meet the dynamic needs of our commercial and government customers. We have recently developed game-changing technologies that we believe will shape the future of renewable energy, grid modernization and other energy-dense storage applications. Central to our aspirations is delivering much-needed economic diversification and high-paying advanced manufacturing jobs. By undertaking development of this manufacturing facility and green energy storage market, we think we\u2019ll be able to deliver on that aspiration in a truly meaningful way that will eventually touch the lives and economic security of thousands in our community.\u201d\n\nGTS, which provides advanced engineering solutions for defense, homeland security, and related U.S. government and international customers, will construct a 500,000-square-foot advanced manufacturing center to produce and distribute 100 percent green energy storage systems using advanced composites and engineering technologies. The new facility will be located on approximately 30 acres of land currently owned by the City of Virginia Beach, at the site of the former Owl\u2019s Creek Golf Course. Construction will begin in the first quarter of 2018 and the facility will be operational in 2019.\n\n\u201cGlobal Technical Systems has called Virginia Beach home for 20 years, and an expansion of this magnitude is transformational for the city and the region,\u201d said Governor Terry McAuliffe. \u201cCreating well-paid, 21st-century jobs is fundamental to our mission to diversify and build the new Virginia economy, and today\u2019s major announcement is another step forward.

Governor McAuliffe approved a $1.8 million grant from the Commonwealth\u2019s Opportunity Fund to assist the city with the project. The governor also approved a $3 million performance-based grant from the Virginia Investment Partnership program, an incentive available to existing companies.

Smith University's Sustainability Village program, chef Njathi Kabui went to work on a breakfast dish as he explained his cooking process to anyone who wanted to listen.\n\nHe began with an eggplant that he brought from his own garden. He saut\u00e9ed the eggplant in a pot then began adding ingredients: diced tomatoes, onions, rosemary, basil, parsley, coriander, a small amount of peach, a few cracked eggs and a bit of ngaingai, a Congolese plant with a citrusy taste.\n\nclick to enlarge Njathi Kabui gets to work at a recent Sustainability Village market on West Trade Street. (Photo by Ryan Pitkin)\n\nAs he finished, he began scooping out the green and yellow grub and placing it on slices of seven-grain bread, then topping each one with a thin slice of cucumber before serving them to anyone in attendance, free of charge. His most important ingredient, however, was one that no one saw him toss in the pot: social justice.\n\n\"I call it Afrofuturistic conscious cuisine,\" he told me when I asked how he describes his food. \"It's cuisine that is steeped in the South and the struggle for justice and the influence of African food in the South. I understand food to be one of the most political things you ever touch in your life. People cannot be politically free if they don't have control of their food.\"\n\nAnd in that statement, Chef Kabui wrapped up the driving force behind a movement that has become stronger in Charlotte over the last two years; a movement to not only confront the food access gap in some of Charlotte's most underserved communities, but to tackle it head-on.\n\nOrganizations like the Sustainability Village, The Bulb and Rosa Parks Farmers Market in west Charlotte have been working \u2014 often together \u2014 to bring farm fresh foods to communities that have not historically had access to it.\n\nThe expression most folks use is a food desert, but Kabui calls that a loaded term.\n\n\"To say that there's a food desert, OK, food doesn't grow in the desert, but why do we use that word in actuality?\" he asked. \"The reason why we use that word is to make the crime of denying a people power less cynical or less biting. The reason why there are no foods in certain parts of the United States \u2014 one of the richest countries on the planet \u2014 is because people decide that those people should be powerless.\"\n\nAnd that's why Kabui, who has traveled the country teaching cooking demonstrations and giving speeches about food and its ties to social justice, has been happy to partner with the Sustainability Village and the Rosa Parks Farmers Market for the last three summers.\n\nTo be food insecure means to not have reliable access to affordable, nutritious food. Mecklenburg County's food insecurity rate is 16.4 percent, according to a report recently released by an independent consulting firm hired by the county. That percentage, which is higher than the national average of 13.4 percent, means that 173,000 Mecklenburg residents are food insecure.\n\nclick to enlarge Just a bit of the selection from Sustainability Village at Rosa Parks Farmer Market. (Photo by Ryan Pitkin)\n\nOpened in June 2016 as a partnership between the Mecklenburg County Health Department and Johnson C. Smith and the Historic West End Partners, the Rosa Parks Farmers Market aims to bring that number down in the Beatties Ford corridor.\n\nMore than a year before opening, the county formed the Rosa Parks Farmers Market Community Advisory Council (RPCAC), made up of community members in an effort to find what residents would like to see in a local farmers market.\n\n\"We build things and then we expect people to come,\" said Elliot Royal, food access coordinator with the county's health department. \"But we wanted to build what that area was interested in.\"\n\nSome of the key points coming from community members included the desire to see people of color working the market. They also wanted the market to accept EBT cards, allowing them to use their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits.\n\nOrganizers at the Rosa Parks Farmers Market have addressed both of these needs.\n\nAs for SNAP, organizers were happy to oblige. Not only that, they encouraged it. Royal said that Rosa Parks Farmers Market is the only farmers market in Charlotte that offers \"Double Bucks,\" meaning that customers can redeem up to $20 worth of SNAP benefits and buy double that amount worth of fruits and vegetables.\n\n\"In a month, we're able to enhance a family's nutrition intake by $80 [worth of food],\" Royal said.\n\nAs for the other feedback heard by Rosa Parks market organizers, much of the food being offered at the market comes not only from people of color, but from students learning their trade right next door.\n\nJohnson C. Smith's Sustainability Village is a program that was launched in 2013 and played a big role in helping the Rosa Parks Farmers Market get its start. The initiative was launched to address food access issues in the city's northwest corridor. The program makes use of raised beds, aquaponics and hydroponic systems housed right on campus to help educate students and provide community members with accessible, healthy food.\n\nDuring a recent Rosa Parks Farmers Market, which is held every Tuesday from 3 to 7 p.m., a group of students sat behind baskets of organic squash, zucchini, cucumbers, corn, peaches, tomatoes, okra, mint and more that had been grown on campus just a block away.\n\nBrenda Montanez, a biology major working with Sustainability Village, said the selection was based on community feedback, rather than trying to tell folks what they should be eating.\n\nclick to enlarge Brenda Montanez (right) with her fellow Sustainability Village volunteers at a recent Rosa Parks Farmer Market. (Photo by Ryan Pitkin)\n\nStudents with the organization have carried out community surveys by going door-to-door and are constantly seeking feedback from people who attend the market.\n\n\"We try to have as much as they will potentially use, so we grow products that they want rather than the ones that we think they would like,\" Montanez said.\n\nAnother bit of feedback Sustainability Village organizers heard was that residents have a hard time reaching the Rosa Parks market on Tuesday afternoon, according to Dr. Philip Otienoburu, director at Johnson C. Smith's Center for Renewable Energy and Sustainability.\n\n\"It's still a big barrier for people to access the market,\" Otienoburu said. \"Most people tell us that they'd prefer to have a Saturday market, because that aligns with their shopping schedule and is the time when they have free time available from work.\"\n\nHe said that Saturday's Sustainability Village market was just a pilot program, and he plans to hold two more \u2014 one every other Saturday \u2014 to test whether enough people will come to make it worthwhile to bring on more vendors beside just the Sustainability Village students. The first Saturday market drew about a dozen customers in the first couple of hours when Creative Loafing was there. The next one will be held on September 1 at 8 a.m.\n\nThough it may take time for residents to catch on to the Saturday markets, Sustainability Village will be moving full steam ahead. On Wednesday, August 22, Otienoburu and the rest of the Sustainability Village crew broke ground on the construction of three new greenhouses that are expected to quadruple food production on the campus, providing year-round nourishment for underserved communities on the west side. The expansion comes thanks to a $325,000 investment from Blue Cross Blue Shield.\n\nVivian Stuart, interim chair of the RPCAC, hopes the market can not only serve food but also help turn around a struggling piece of land. This summer, the market moved from the Mecklenburg County Health Department on Beatties Ford Road to a parking lot on West Trade Street. Across the street, the Mosaic Village flourishes, but the old A&P Grocery still stands boarded up and abandoned in the lot where the farmers market now operates.\n\nLast year, there were reports of a restaurant incubator opening in the building, but nothing has come of it.\n\nclick to enlarge Vivian Stuart at a recent Rosa Parks Famrers Market. (Photo by Ryan Pitkin)\n\n\"It's a wonderful feeling for us, because they talk about the so-called food desert, and this is bringing fresh, affordable food to the community,\" Stuart said during a recent market. \"I can see it's going to rejuvenate this area. And that building, one day we expect it to open, and that will be also an advantage to the community.\"\n\nWith all the fresh food coming into the community, folks need to know what to do with it. Upon the launch of the Rosa Parks Farmers Market in 2016, Otienoburu recruited Chef Kabui to hold cooking demonstrations there so community members could learn ways to take advantage of the new foods available to them.\n\n\"One thing that we wanted to do was, one, increase food access in the corridor, but also create the local capacity for not only growing food but also preparing food at home,\" he said. \"Because the culture of cooking is eroding in the community, and we can't just present a farmers market to the neighborhoods around here without guiding them on how to prepare their foods. These two things go hand in hand.\"\n\nThe idea has been a hit, as Kabui has built a following of regulars who attend the Tuesday markets just to learn new tricks from him.\n\n\"It's a very, very special opportunity for me and it's something that's very dear across my heart,\" Kabui said. \"To look at people who are from underserved communities who are really beginning to understand food in a very complex way is very interesting to me; to see how people can begin to make very fundamental changes where they understand exactly the big implications of food.\"\n\nThe big implications of food are not lost on Alisha Pruett.\n\nclick to enlarge Alisha Pruett (foreground) sets up shop in Druid Hills with Trenisha Birtha and her sons. (Photo by Dana Vindigni)\n\nAs a social worker who moved to Charlotte from New York City in 2012, Pruett worked to find housing for homeless veterans. She quickly recognized the issues surrounding food accessibility in certain communities around the city.\n\n\"I would house [clients] and I would realize they were away from food access or food resources and even referring them to food pantries was a haul for them,\" Pruett said.\n\nFurthermore, when she would go to the food pantries herself to pick up food for her clients, she realized that all of the food was processed.\n\n\"Even though that was a great resource, it was just not healthy food for the people I was serving. Diabetes was rampant in my caseload,\" Pruett said. \"I didn't feel comfortable with that, so I started going to farmer's markets and gleaning off of what they couldn't sell.\"\n\nLittle did she know that her efforts to feed a family or two with the leftovers from farmers market vendors would turn into The Bulb, an organization she founded that now hands out an average of 800 pounds of fresh food per day to 30 underserved communities in and around Charlotte.\n\nPruett partners with local farmers, local organizations like Friendship Gardens, farmers markets and corporations like Trader Joe's to provide residents in food insecure neighborhoods with healthy food. Since launching in October 2016, The Bulb has provided nearly 10,000 pounds of free, fresh food to the communities that need it the most.\n\nOn a recent Thursday afternoon, I met Caroline Miller, a volunteer with The Bulb, at the Charlotte Transportation Center for a free market she helps organize there between 3 and 5 p.m. each week.\n\nclick to enlarge Caroline Miller at a recent Bulb market at the Transit Center. (Photo by Ryan Pitkin)\n\nWhen I arrived, Miller already had a tent and a table set up with piles of fruits and veggies including apples, eggplants, squash, lemons, tomatoes, onions, lettuce, eggs and peppers of all shapes and colors. Some folks knowingly approached and began filling up bags, while it took others some time to realize that the cornucopia of fresh foods in front of them was for the taking.\n\nAs Miller worked alongside new Bulb employee Trenisha Birtha, the two were sure to meet each and every customer who approached the table, asking their names even while rushing to replace the rapidly diminishing piles of food on the tables.\n\nStephen Hayes, a north Charlotte resident who was at the Transit Center to commute between his day job and night job, filled a bag with zucchini, squash and spring onions that he said he would use for a casserole; eggplant for lasagna; and red peppers that he would find a use for in whatever he cooked, he said.\n\n\"This means a lot to me,\" Hayes said. \"This saved me 20 bucks. I'm not spending money that I work hard for but I really don't get to see.\"\n\nIt's a sentiment that Pruett has seen shared again and again from thankful customers, some of whom don't have the ability to work two jobs like Hayes and are on a very fixed income.\n\n\"The average people we serve only have $15 in SNAP, and they really are struggling to get food,\" Pruett said. \"The corner store markets or Burger King, they're expensive meal for meal, and a lot of people are saving money and putting their money toward rent. I have seen \u2014 especially in the affordable housing units we serve \u2014 the eviction rates are going down, because they're saving about $200 a month with us being there weekly.\"\n\nMiller, who used to volunteer for Friendship Gardens but now focuses all of her energy on The Bulb, said she's been blown away by the generosity of customers who attend the Transit Center market.\n\nclick to enlarge Caroline Miller (right) with Trenisha Birtha and her sons at the Transit Center market that they run for The Bulb on Thursdays. (Photo by Ryan Pitkin)\n\n\"I've been most amazed at how appreciative people are that we're here for them, how overwhelmed they are that we're actually just giving it to them,\" Miller said. \"And also how much they want to help us. I find now that every time I show up for this market, I have this plethora of people that want to help set up and they ask about how they can get involved and help or volunteer. And these are the people in the community who are so affected by this generosity and what Alisha's created. I think it inspires them to give back as well.\"\n\nIn fact, that's how Birtha got involved. She met Pruett through the market and volunteered to help. Then, in late July, The Bulb received a grant from the North End Smart District that will fund The Bulb for four months while it served eight North End neighborhoods on a weekly basis.\n\nThe grant didn't just help with gas money and other supplies, it also allowed Pruett to make a much-needed expansion, hiring three people from inside the neighborhoods she serves.\n\nOne of them was Birtha, who now works as an outreach coordinator with the organization. She said her goal is to one day start her own nonprofit, and her new job as put her on that path.\n\nclick to enlarge Trenisha Birtha (left) chats with customers at a recent Bulb market while Stephen Hayes picks out ingredients for a lasagna he planned on making. (Photo by Ryan Pitkin)\n\n\"Alisha needed help, and this is something that's perfect for me,\" Birtha said. \"I'm dealing with people that I'm comfortable with. I'm giving back. I can bring my kids. This is just always something that I wanted to do. I feel like it's a blessing because I didn't know where to start, and I got my start.\"\n\nWhile tents and tables like the one at the Transit Center used to be the norm, Pruett was able to take her market on the road this past June after completing a Feeding Innovation seed-starter program and receiving a grant from the SC Community Loan Fund.\n\nThe grant made it possible for her to buy a trailer. She's now able to drive around and set up shop much more comfortably in the communities she serves. Quicker set ups and takedowns allow her to hit more spots in a day, as well.\n\nOnce she arrives at a new location, she said, that's when the magic happens. That was evident on a recent morning in the Druid Hills neighborhood in north Charlotte, when two women got to talking while filling bags with veggies. The women were neighbors but had never met. Soon they were swapping stories and recipes.\n\n\"When you bring that nourishment to every community, you see people actually feeling better, communing around our truck or tables, and a lot of people start talking about recipes and what they're going to cook this Sunday, like we just heard,\" Pruett said. \"So I do think that it's a lot more than just distributing food, like other programs might. We know everyone's name and we try to initiate a conversation on how we get better as a community.\"\n\nclick to enlarge Alisha Pruett prepares her mobile market.\n\nPruett often hosts cooking demonstrations wherever she sets up shop, similar to what Chef Kabui does at the Rosa Parks Farmers Market. Within the next year, she hopes to introduce a new type of community building by hosting art workshops out of the trailer while she's serving food.\n\nShe wants to allow folks to sell their art out of the trailer, giving them an opportunity to profit as creatives.\n\nBut in the immediate future, she'll be unveiling a new kind of art, as the Charlotte-based design firm The Plaid Penguin is currently working on a wrap for the new trailer, which is currently a plain white. She plans to show off the newly decked-out trailer at the Rosa Parks Farmers Market on Tuesday, August 28.\n\nPruett tries to be a vendor at the market as often as possible.\n\n\"That market is quintessential,\" Pruett said when I brought up the Rosa Parks market. \"It's not just a market, it's servicing the neighborhood, and seeing all these organizations come together and farmers and cooks and chefs, that's basically an ideal thing for us. That's the pinnacle example. We want to do that on the road.\"\n\nclick to enlarge Njathi Kabui\n\nAlso at the market that day, you can expect to see Chef Kabui teaching folks how to make great food, all the while tying it in with the one thing he finds most important: empowering communities.\n\nKabui doesn't drive down from his home in Apex on a weekly basis just to throw some things in a pot and call it a day. He \u2014 like Stuart, like Pruett, like Royal, like Birtha \u2014 has a vision.\n\n\"The reason why the market is here is because of the very foundational unsustainability of the cultural and business practices that we have in this country, in the South and globally,\" he said. \"We do things without thinking long-term. We do things that are for market reasons, just on the bottom line, 'How much money am I making?' Obviously, now we are thinking slightly different. We have come to the realization that that's not always the smartest thing to do.\n\n\"As we reinvigorate this market, I hope that the message can be driven home that we have to make very, very fundamental changes, and among those are the way that we eat, the way we think about food and the relationship that we have with food, as a foundation for creating more just and more equitable societies.\"\n\nAnd it all starts with one corridor.", "title": "Efforts to Tackle Food Insecurity in Charlotte Are Finally Gaining Ground", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "['food']", "annot_city": "['Charlotte']"}, {"id": 408, "city": "['Milwaukee']", "url": "https://urbanmilwaukee.com/2019/04/10/can-city-combat-food-deserts/", "text": "City panel hears report on many residents living far from full-service grocery store, but takes no action.\n\nGet a daily rundown of the top stories on Urban Milwaukee\n\nThe city of Milwaukee continues to look for ways to bring healthy foods to all of its residents.\n\nAlthough tackling the problem of food deserts and food swamps, the proliferation of unhealthy options in low-income neighborhoods, is proving to be a difficult task for the city to wrap its arms around.\n\nAldermen and alderwomen asked the Milwaukee Department of Community Development to develop a fresh food access strategy three years ago. On Tuesday, a city panel was presented with a report showing 21 percent of Milwaukee\u2019s population, or 124,000 people, live further than 1 mile from a grocery store.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Agriculture defines a food desert as a low-income area where access to a full-service grocery store is 1 mile away. But Vanessa Koster, city planning manager, pointed out half a mile is a more reasonable distance to measure, since many residents don\u2019t have access to vehicles.\n\nThirty-seven percent of Milwaukee residents don\u2019t live within a half mile of a full-service grocery store, according to the report. Milwaukee\u2019s poverty rate is about 25 percent. More than 37 percent of the city\u2019s population is obese, according to the report.\n\nCity officials are looking at models that have worked nationwide, including in Baltimore and Philadelphia.\n\nIn Baltimore, the Baltimarket is a virtual supermarket program that has increased access to healthy food in neighborhoods with limited access to grocery stores. Pennsylvania subsidized a $30 million program in Philadelphia to increase access to healthy food options. That program included providing money to corner stores to pay for chillers needed for fresh fruit and vegetables.\n\nOne thing that has been working in Milwaukee is the Fresh Picks Mobile Market, an initiative between anti-hunger nonprofit Hunger Task Force and the Pick \u2018n Save grocery store chain. The truck makes about 34 stops per month in the city\u2019s food deserts.\n\nLaunched in October 2015, the mobile market sells produce, dairy and meat products all reduced by 25 percent.\n\nAldermen and alderwomen suggested trying to expand that program with city financing.\n\n\u201cWe would be better off subsidizing a bunch of trucks than a bunch of big box stores,\u201d said Ald. Robert Bauman. \u201cI could see doing a blue-collar version of the Peapod service to bring food to the people.\u201d\n\nThe city also has created a number of community garden initiatives and changed its ordinances to allow people to raise chickens.\n\nThe report identified several goals the city should be working toward, including attracting grocery stores to underserved neighborhoods, developing other retail outlets as sources of fresh food, increasing the stock of fresh food in corner stores, increasing the amount of locally grown food that is available to consumers, and improving transportation to grocery stores and farmers markets.\n\nWhat was not clear was who in city government was going to be responsible for implementing these strategies.\n\n\u201cI get the gardens and I get the grocery stores, but we\u2019re in Wisconsin, so the farmers markets and the gardens are great, but they\u2019re not going to keep people fed year-round,\u201d said Ald.

But the large contingent of youth and the meeting\u2019s location in the Mountain West will carry the same gravitas of previous gatherings at U.N. headquarters in Manhattan.\n\nIndeed, the selection of Utah\u2019s capital and heavy involvement of youth in planning and participating in the 68th Annual United Nations Civil Society Conference makes a statement.\n\n\u201cIn visiting Salt Lake City I was struck by the rapid growth and innovation there, symbolized by the construction cranes dotting the beautiful mountain landscape, and by the sense of opportunity as young people flock to the region for its educational and job offerings. It is a great setting for a global conversation on inclusion and sustainability in cities and communities of all sizes,\u201d Alison Smale, United Nations under-secretary general for global communications, said in the statement.\n\nThe three-day conference marks the first time it has been held outside of New York when the United States has been host. Paris, Mexico City and Melbourne, Australia, are among cities that have hosted the conference in the past.\n\nThis year\u2019s event will focus on sustainable cities and communities. The topic is among the 17 sustainable development goals the U.N. General Assembly adopted in 2015. Others include ending hunger and poverty, reducing inequality, and promoting decent work and economic growth \u2014 all to be achieved by 2030.\n\n\u201cThe Sustainable Development Goals are a global framework for cooperation to tackle the great challenges of our day,\u201d said Maruxa Cardama, conference chairwoman and secretary general of the non-governmental organization Partnership on Sustainable Low Carbon Transport. \u201cCities are growing so quickly that it is imperative we build them thoughtfully and make extra efforts to ensure that no person or group is left behind.\u201d\n\nMore than half (55%) of the world\u2019s population lives in urban areas and that figure is expected to reach 68% by 2050, according to the U.N. The conference is intended to help government and nongovernment leaders find sustainable solutions to poverty, housing, hunger and health, clean water, energy, climate change, infrastructure, transportation, education, migration, violence and gender equality.\n\nMore than 90 percent of Utah\u2019s population lives along the densely populated Wasatch Front corridor, with Salt Lake City located near the midpoint of the more than 100-mile stretch of cities and towns connected by roads and transit systems.\n\nConference organizers were persuaded by Salt Lake City officials that the city\u2019s efforts to tackle many of the issues the conference will address make it an ideal location.\n\n\u201cWith everything we are doing to build a sustainable and resilient city, from investing in more equitable transit and housing to becoming a clean energy city \u2014 Salt Lake City is the perfect place to have these important conversations,\u201d Mayor Jackie Biskupski said.\n\nIt will be one of the largest international events the city has hosted since the 2002 Winter Olympics.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s fitting that the U.N. is holding this here in that Utah is recognized globally as a place with a robust free market economy and civil society,\u201d said Deseret News Opinion Editor Boyd Matheson. He will moderate a panel discussion on how faith groups and other nongovernmental entities can offer people upward mobility, or opportunities to improve their economic situation.\n\nYouth movement\n\nThe annual conference used to be heavily focused on the work of non-governmental organizations \u2014 nonprofit agencies engaged in humanitarian, educational, health, human rights and environmental endeavors.\n\nBut a U.N. reorganization and renaming of departments and sections resulted in changing the name to Civil Society Conference, which better describes the broader group of stakeholders involved, including young adults, said Annie Deng, co-chairwoman for the Outcomes Sub-committee and sub-task lead on the Youth Declaration for the conference.\n\nBiskupski said the city made an intentional effort to recruit youth in the planning and carrying out of the conference. In fact, a record 43 percent of the attendees will be 32 years old or younger, she said.\n\n\u201cWe want this younger group to be at the table and having their voices heard because they are living with these issues today.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe like 32 years because that is the average age\u201d of the world population, she said. \u201cWe want this younger group to be at the table and having their voices heard because they are living with these issues today.\u201d\n\nVlada Yeramenko, 23, is among the dozens of local college students who got involved in organizing events for the conference. A native of Ukraine who graduated in May from the University of Utah with a bachelor\u2019s degree in international relations, she said her academic interests and her personal experience as an immigrant inspired her to get involved.\n\nHer mother\u2019s marriage brought Yeramenko to the United States when she was 15. She spoke little English, but a welcoming community in Sante Fe, New Mexico, helped her assimilate, develop her skills as a violinist and eventually find her passion in international relations.\n\n\u201cThis is a conference for everyone to feel included, and then to work to find solutions to the problems that we\u2019re facing right now,\u201d she said.\n\nThe young adults are also injecting an element of fun with their work. Before attendees begin three days of speeches and absorbing information from about 200 workshops, youth planners put together events on Saturday where they will be planting trees, cleaning up a section of the Jordan River, relaxing to yoga and discussing the U.N.\u2019s sustainable development goals.\n\nThe conference will include youth-led workshops and unveil a Youth Climate Compact that was drafted with input submitted before the conference from young adults around the world, said Deng.\n\nThe lengthy document lists nearly two dozen action items \u2014 ranging from recycling and consumption awareness to divesting in fossil fuels businesses and converting to renewable energy sources \u2014 that youth pledge to do to \u201cunite in action against the climate crisis.\u201d\n\nSustainable cities\n\nBiskupski said the city\u2019s negotiated agreement with Rocky Mountain Power in 2016 to provide 100% renewable energy by 2032 was a factor that caught the attention of U.N. officials reaching out to Salt Lake.\n\n\u201cThat made news across the country because cities had not been able to get their energy providers to really move the needle on going to 100% renewable,\u201d she said.\n\nThe city\u2019s investment in affordable housing, transit development and infrastructure were other components to its proposal that won over the U.N. a year ago this month.\n\nAnother factor is the state\u2019s involvement in humanitarian work, said Baldomero Lago, chief international officer for Utah Valley University, who first suggested to U.N. officials that they reach out to Salt Lake, the Deseret News reported in March. He had access to U.N. officials through after his Utah Valley United Nations, a group of humanitarian relief groups, business and faith-based groups, gained U.N. accreditation.\n\n\u201cWe talk about sustainability, but it is the humanity that actually makes things happen to sustain the world that we live in,\u201d Lago said in November, when the city announced it was hosting the conference.\n\nAlso at that announcement was Ahmad Corbitt, a director in the public affairs Department of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who added that cities are sustained first and foremost by residents\u2019 willingness to give of themselves.\n\nThe church is offering that opportunity at the conference. Its U.N.-affiliated Latter-day Saint Charities is partnering with Feeding Children Everywhere, American Airlines, JustServe and conference participants to assemble 375,000 meals for needy children during the three-day event.\n\nLatter-day Saint Charities Director Sister Sharon Eubank will also sit on a conference panel in a Tuesday session titled Civil Society Monitoring. Bishop G\u00e9rald Cause\u00e9, presiding bishop of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, will offer brief remarks at the conference\u2019s closing plenary session on Wednesday.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version incorrectly stated that the United Nation\u2019s Civil Society Conference is the largest international event Salt Lake City has hosted since the 2002 Winter Olympics.

Both the Nashville and Clarksville areas face increasing challenges in housing, health, education and infrastructure, in spite of \u2014 or because of \u2014 their rapid growth.\n\n\"A lot of the challenge has to do with not keeping up with critical infrastructure,\" Ralph Schulz, CEO of the chamber, said. \"In a lot of ways, we are now bumping up on what those challenges can mean to our future prosperity.\"\n\nIncome, education\n\nAcross all levels of education in the Nashville area, the percentage of those below the poverty line has increased between 2007 and 2016, even as unemployment rates have dropped across the board. More than 22 percent of Davidson County children live in poverty and more than half of the region's counties saw an increase in the percentage of students participating in a free or reduced lunch plan in the past decade.\n\nMore recent data shows an improved trajectory. From 2014 to 2017, Nashville poverty rates have declined each year, dropping from about 15 percent to 11 percent, according to chamber officials.\n\nEducation is strongly linked to poverty rates and income levels, with 24 percent of those in the Nashville area who lack a high school diploma living in poverty, compared to 11 percent for those who graduated.\n\nCompared to the nation, Nashville has a greater percentage of individuals without a high school diploma \u2014 9.6 percent to 4.5 percent \u2014 but it also has a greater percentage of those with a bachelors, graduate or professional degree.\n\nIn-migration, which contributed to 70 percent of the region's growth in 2017, is contributing to gains in educational obtainment. Among those moving to the Nashville area from other states, nearly half have a bachelor's degree or higher. Of those moving from another country, about 58 percent have those credentials. That compares to between 33 percent to 36 percent among those already in the Nashville area.\n\nTennessee has sought to boost education levels in recent years with initiatives such as Tennessee Promise, Drive to 55, Labor Education Alignment Program and Tennessee Reconnect Act.\n\nCost of living\n\nIn 2009, Nashville ranked below peer cities in cost of living, but by 2017 the area jumped above Columbus, Indianapolis, Charlotte and Raleigh. Meanwhile, median income gains are lagging. Median household income increased 5.3 percent, or by $3,042, between 2006 and 2016, but Nashville lagged many of its peer cities in income gains. Clarksville's median income declined in that period.\n\n\"The change in wage growth, salary growth coming out of the Great Recession was a relatively modest change compared to previous business cycles,\" Garrett Harper, vice president of research for the chamber, said.\n\nHealth\n\nWhile Nashville is known for its health care expertise, the city exceeds the national average in the percentage of those lacking health insurance. In Nashville, 9.5 percent of residents lack health insurance, compared to 8.7 percent nationally.\n\nIn 2016, 46 percent of employers offered health insurance, down from 69 percent in 2006. Other than Charlotte, Nashville had the most dramatic decline among peer cities in the percentage of employers dropping coverage.\n\nFrom 2012 to 2016, the percentage of expectant mothers with adequate prenatal care, defined by the number of doctor visits during pregnancy, dropped in every Middle Tennessee county except Dickson and Montgomery. In Sumner and Cannon counties, the percentage fell by close to 11 percent.\n\n\"Good health starts with prenatal care and only about half of the infants born in the Nashville region have received adequate prenatal care,\" the report said.\n\nAfter birth, many Nashville-area children lack health care. Nashville has had significantly higher numbers of children without health insurance compared to peer cities in recent years. About 13,000 Nashville children lacked health insurance in 2016, compared to fewer than 5,000 in Raleigh, Austin, Cleveland and Seattle.\n\nState lawmakers have rejected efforts to expand Medicaid in recent years, even as Gov. Bill Haslam proposed expansion plans. During his campaign, Gov.-elect Bill Lee said he would oppose Medicaid expansion and described the existing program as \"fundamentally flawed.\"\n\nIn Davidson County, more than 35 percent of students in public schools are obese. In Hickman, Smith, Maury, Robertson, Rutherford and Cannon, the percentage exceeds 40. The long-term costs of obesity include hospitalization, pharmaceutical expenses and work productivity losses, according to the report.\n\n\"It's impacting our employers' ability to get employees who can be there and be fully present,\" Jennifer Carlat, the chamber's chief policy officer said. \"The labor market is tight enough that we are looking at all of these issues because they are important to all of our members.\"\n\nHousing, transportation costs\n\nNashville-area residents are increasingly cost-burdened, spending more than half their income on housing and transportation.\n\nIn Nashville, the median cost of housing increased by 54 percent from 2008 to 2018, climbing to $246,500 from $159,800. While Nashville offers competitive wages compared to the national average, residents are increasingly spending a majority of their earnings on housing and transportation, according to the report.\n\nAt issue is the available inventory, which has not caught up with demand, chamber officials said.\n\n\"The overall cost of living in the region remains lower than the national average,\" Schulz said. \"The increased cost of living, especially as it relates to housing, due to increased demand outpacing supply, is one of the most common challenges attributed to our growth.\"\n\nThe cost of infrastructure needs in Davidson County alone totaled $5.7 billion for nearly 690 projects, including those related to education, transportation and health. Tennessee received \"C\" or lower grades on its inland waterways, school facilities, transit, drinking water and wastewater infrastructure.\n\nIn recent years, the chamber has featured costs of commuting and congestion in its Vital Signs report. The chamber-backed Let's Move Nashville initiative to fund $5 billion in public transportation upgrades under a plan called nMotion failed to gather Davidson County voter support in May 2018. Chamber officials said the next proposal could be created between 2022 and 2024.\n\n\"The referendum, when it failed, it said Davidson County wasn't ready to put dedicated funding to this,\" Carlat said. \"The nMotion plan is still the plan, but now they know they have a constrained budget they have to implement that plan through. The next few years are going to be about, what are all the ways we can squeeze more efficiency from the system we have?\"\n\nAs infrastructure projects pile up, the region's population is growing. From 2007 to 2017, the Nashville area's population grew by 25 percent, or 400,000 people, to 1.9 million people.

Across the U.S., 14 percent of residents were living below the poverty level in 2016, compared to 14.7 percent the year before, while Tennessee's poverty rate fell from 16.7 to 15.8 percent last year.\n\nIncomes also were on the upswing on the state and national levels, as well as locally.

It also had the lowest poverty rate, at 11.6 percent, of any metro area in the state.\n\nDespite the income growth, the number of people in the Memphis area living below the poverty level of $24,250 for a family of four grew to more than 256,000 last year, an increase of more than 13,000 from 2015. The poverty rate declined slightly among white and Hispanic residents, the census figures show, but it increased among African-Americans.\n\nThe percentage of Memphis-area children in poverty rose from 28.8 to 30.8. High school-dropouts were six times more likely to live below the poverty line than college graduates.\n\nAll major ethnic groups in metro Memphis enjoyed gains in median household income. But black households still were taking in just $35,542, barely half the $67,781 median for white households.\n\nThe census figures also documented the continued decline in the number of people with no health insurance -- trend that could end if Congress doesn't bolster exchanges operating under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nStatewide, 9 percent of the population had no health insurance last year, down from 10.3 percent in 2015.

A panel Thursday at Virginia Commonwealth University addressed the Eviction Lab at Princeton University\u2019s findings that five cities in Virginia ranked in the top 10 for national eviction rates, including Richmond, Hampton, Newport News, Norfolk and Chesapeake.\n\nThe local eviction rates ranged from 11.4% in Richmond to 7.9% in Chesapeake. The rate represents the number of evictions per 100 rental homes in an area.\n\nAbout 150 people attended the event, which included three panelists: Six Points Innovation Center director Jackie Washington, Virginia Poverty Law Center attorney Phil Storey, and Sen. Jennifer McClellan (D-Richmond).\n\nMcClellan highlighted seven bills that passed the recent General Assembly session and were signed into law. The legislation included bills that made written leases required, reduced the number of eviction cases a landlord could file, created the opportunity for tenants to submit unpaid rent and fees prior to eviction, and allow tenants to recover their possessions.\n\n\u201cThis is not really a partisan issue,\u201d McClellan said. \u201cWhere there is disagreement, it\u2019s really sort of the landlords versus tenants, and I don\u2019t mean to say that all landlords are bad or all landlords are predatory.\u201d\n\nOf the seven housing laws signed by the governor last session, four were introduced by Democrats and three by Republicans.\n\nMcClellan also said in a phone interview after the event that more bills to address eviction, including a bill to address the habitability of a rental property, are in the drafting and planning stages now.\n\nThough legislators passed a flurry of bills last session to reform landlord and tenant laws, Storey said \u201cway too many people are on the knife\u2019s edge because of the way the system is designed.\u201d\n\nMuch of the discussion at the panel held at VCU\u2019s W.E. Singleton Center for the Performing Arts centered around how tenants fall behind on rent payments.\n\n\u201cTwo-thirds of the people who call our hotline are behind on rent, with the average caller being around two and a half months back,\u201d Storey said.\n\nStorey also said that on average their clients are paying 58% of their monthly gross income to rent, with some paying as much as 70%.\n\nPanelists also discussed the link between discriminatory housing policies and the eviction rate today, which according to the RVA Eviction Lab increases as the share of the African-American population in a neighborhood increases. Washington highlighted historic redlining in Richmond\u2019s Jackson Ward neighborhood, where banks would avoid making real estate investments based on neighborhood demographics, as \u201can intentionally racist housing policy.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t connect the dots from historic housing policy, then we just might miss it,\u201d Washington said. \u201cBut those who experience it will never miss it. Folks of color will always know that it\u2019s racist.\u201d\n\nStorey agreed, saying that \u201cthings that seem sort of natural and immutable are often not and are based in some pretty ugly root causes.\u201d\n\nThe panel was sponsored by VCU\u2019s L. Douglas Wilder School of Government and Public Affairs, VCU University College and Virginia\u2019s home for Public Media. The panelists were introduced by Benjamin Teresa and Kathryn Howell, co-directors of the RVA Eviction Lab at VCU, which opened this year and provides eviction data and research.\n\n\u201cOne of the goals of the lab is to do research that is relevant to Richmond and other cities in Virginia, as well as outside of the state,\u201d Teresa said.\n\nThe panel was connected to this year\u2019s VCU Common Book, a program that selects a new book each year for incoming freshmen. The initiative is intended to foster awareness and engagement around important issues.\n\nIncoming freshmen received a copy of \u201cEvicted,\u201d a book by Matthew Desmond, the founder of the Eviction Lab at Princeton University. Freshman-level courses incorporate the book into coursework and discussion. Desmond is scheduled to visit VCU on Oct. 16.\n\nCandidates from many Virginia House and Senate districts will have a chance to weigh in on evictions at a forum on Oct. 10.

By voting in support of the dismissal of municipal and traffic warrants, fines and fees, the Council created an opening for more than forty-thousand New Orleanians to escape a vicious cycle of poverty and incarceration. With council members, judges, community advocates, and directly impacted city residents coming together to imagine a more just criminal legal system, our city is positioned to jump from being the target of civil rights lawsuits to being a leader in reform.\n\nDismissing existing fines, fees and warrants is only the beginning. Lifting the shadow currently hanging over the heads of tens of thousands of New Orleanians will help many escape the cycle of poverty and criminalization, but every day that the current system exists, more will get sucked in. We need a whole new system, focused on accountability and restorative justice.\n\n\u201dThis is not a justice system. This is a wealth extraction system that has criminalized poor people of color, trapped us in a cycle of poverty, and used the profits to fund itself.\u201d\n\nTina Weary struggles to make ends meet as a preloader for UPS. She could more than double her income by getting promoted to being a driver, but her license is suspended. Six years ago, she was pulled over and fined $792 for driving uninsured and with brake tags the police officer thought were fake. She couldn\u2019t pay the fine and was put on a payment plan that she couldn\u2019t afford either. She slowly fell behind until a letter arrived one day notifying her her license had been suspended.\n\nShe\u2019s been unable to drive ever since and she feels trapped. A bicycle doesn\u2019t get her very far in New Orleans East and her wages as a preloader don\u2019t get her any closer to paying off her traffic debt. It\u2019s a catch-22 with no obvious escape.\n\nTina is not alone. A staggering one in seven adult New Orleanians has a warrant out for their arrest. As we found in our recent report, NOLA Shakedown: How Criminalizing Municipal Fines & Fees Traps Poor & Working Class Black New Orleanians in Poverty, more than 56,000 outstanding warrants are in the Municipal and Traffic Court, and the vast majority of these warrants are for minor offenses that cause little to no harm to society, including thousands for crimes of homelessness and poverty. Given that New Orleans has the highest poverty rate of any major American city, it\u2019s no surprise that tens of thousands of New Orleanians have been swept up into this cycle.\n\nIt\u2019s also no coincidence that the burden falls disproportionately on Black New Orleanians. Louisiana has the highest race and gender wage gap in the nation, with Black women earning 47 cents for every dollar earned by a white man. The median household income for Black residents in Orleans Parish in 2017 was $24,418, compared to $63,482 for white residents. As a result, sixty-nine percent of people with warrants are Black, further entrenching racial inequality in the criminal legal system.\n\nThis is not a justice system. This is a wealth extraction system that has criminalized poor people of color, trapped us in a cycle of poverty, and used the profits to fund itself. Historically, the city\u2019s court system has been funded by fines and fees, tying court budgets to the number of people who walk through the door and the dollar amount they are charged. Perversely, when factoring in the cost of jailing people for nonpayment, these fines and fees are a financial drain on the city.\n\nAfter years of advocacy and a series of lawsuits, however, things are beginning to change. City Council\u2019s vote calling for the Municipal Court to wipe outstanding fines, fees and warrants is a crucial step in the right direction and a display of the type of leadership we should expect from our elected officials. The openness to reform and creative solutions that Municipal Court judges like Judge Paul Sens have shown is incredibly heartening too. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of New Orleanians like Tina want to get back on the right side of the law if they only had the means to do so. If we all work together, nothing is stopping the city from not only addressing past harms, but ending the criminalization of poverty going forward, too.\n\nFor years, opponents of reform have argued that there are no viable alternatives to regressive and punitive fines and fees with the threat of incarceration for those who cannot pay. But around the world, other systems have been tested and proven. Courts in Latin America and Europe have used day fines\u2014fines set based on the defendant\u2019s daily personal income\u2014for decades to promote accountability and equity. By adjusting fines based on ability to pay in this way, these courts ensure that no one is punished because they\u2019re poor and that no one escapes meaningful accountability because they\u2019re rich. This system also maintains overall revenue without resorting to a regressive mechanism that exacerbates income inequality.\n\nFor those who are unable to pay even a small fine, we know that humane, dignified community service is possible. This does not need to look like anyone being subjected to humiliating or hazardous work that paid workers refuse to do. Instead, restorative justice practices that are gaining traction in courts around the country show us that non-monetary alternatives can not only provide accountability, but also open up opportunities for rehabilitation and restitution.\n\nThese are models that we can and must adopt. Every New Orleanian deserves to open their mailbox without fear that they will have to choose between paying their electric bill and paying a traffic ticket. Every New Orleanian deserves to drive down the street without fear of being arrested for driving while poor. Every New Orleanian deserves to walk down the street without fear that the color of their skin or the emptiness of their wallet will land them in a jail cell. We can\u2019t shy away from imagining a just future. With last week\u2019s city council vote, and with the support of the Court, the Mayor and the people of New Orleans, that future is within reach.\n\nToya Lewis, Lead Organizer, Stand With Dignity\n\nToya Lewis is an organizer with Stand with Dignity, a program of the New Orleans Workers\u2019 Center for Racial Justice that builds a base of Black underemployed and unemployed workers and their families ready to make necessary changes to the New Orleans economy to have equitable access to full and fair employment.

Home values that have doubled over the last decade have turned the housing market into a pressure cooker. Meanwhile, gentrification runs wild in Southeast Raleigh, with historically black neighborhoods being devoured by white buyers building luxurious homes on tiny lots, as The New York Times recently noted.\n\nIn Durham, which is facing similar issues, Mayor Steve Schewel has proposed a $95 million housing bond, the largest ever in North Carolina\u2014further fueling perceptions that Raleigh isn\u2019t doing enough. With an election looming and affordable housing topping the list of voters\u2019 concerns, the Raleigh City Council is under pressure to do something meaningful to address this burgeoning crisis.\n\nBut it\u2019s not clear what that something will be.\n\nThe council will hear a presentation from staff Tuesday\u2014after the INDY goes to print\u2014that includes options for what an affordable housing bond referendum might look like. To get the bond on the October ballot, the council needs to make a decision by June 18, according to housing and neighborhood director Larry Jarvis.\n\nTo match Durham\u2019s $95 million bond, Raleigh would need to raise its property tax rate\u2014currently 43.82 cents per $100 of assessed value\u2014by 1.25 cents, or about $25 a year for a $200,000 home.\n\nComplicating matters, on Monday night Wake County\u2019s manager recommended that the Board of Commissioners increase property taxes by 10 percent, mostly to account for $1 billion in school construction, parks, and Wake Tech bonds voters passed last year, but also to bump school funding by $36 million and county operating expenses by slightly less than that. If commissioners approve the manager\u2019s recommendation, the owner of a $200,000 property in Wake County will add $128 to their tax bill.\n\nFor Raleigh homeowners, these hikes would be cumulative.\n\nJarvis wouldn\u2019t say how big a bond the staff would recommend, though he plans to give the council three options. The money could be used in several ways, including building new affordable rental units, down payment assistance for first-time buyers, and rehabbing properties in low-income neighborhoods.\n\nIdeally, Jarvis says, a $100 million bond could produce about three thousand units, though that depends on the kind of tax credits used for specific projects. Even that scenario, though, would only begin to put a dent in the problem.\n\n\u201cWe shouldn\u2019t be looking at just this one tool,\u201d Jarvis says. \u201cIt really is, across the board, what can we do to increase all housing types, housing choices?\u201d\n\nA majority on the council, however, has seemed reluctant to increase density in neighborhoods, which advocates say would increase the supply of housing and thus help keep prices in check. Instead, the majority is looking to voluntary inclusionary zoning\u2014in other words, asking developers to include affordable units in projects for which they\u2019re seeking more intense zonings\u2014as a way to address the problem.\n\nAnother complication is the timing of the bond, Jarvis says. A bond this year would be the only referendum on the ballot. But next year, Raleigh voters could see another school bond or a bond to fund Dix Park, or both, and they might get gun shy; then again, a presidential election draws more people to the polls, likely giving the bonds a better chance of passing.\n\nCouncil members Russ Stephenson and Stef Mendell say they want a bond on the ballot this year for somewhere between $50 million and $100 million. Mendell says she hopes the council can be \u201cbold and ambitious,\u201d while remaining sensitive to the city\u2019s increasing tax burden.\n\n\u201cWhile we\u2019re trying to build five hundred to six hundred [affordable units] a year, we\u2019re losing about a thousand a year,\u201d Mendell says. \u201cThe hole keeps getting bigger, and we have to do as much as we can to fix that. At the same time, obviously, we have to be careful because there are a lot of people who, with gentrification, their property values have increased and their property taxes have increased.\u201d\n\nNo one\u2019s district has been more affected by gentrification than Corey Branch\u2019s, who represents Southeast Raleigh. He wants a $120 million bond.\n\n\u201cThe very people we\u2019re trying to help and give opportunity to, we want to make sure we don\u2019t negatively impact,\u201d Branch says. \u201cSo it\u2019s finding that balance.\u201d\n\nContact staff writer Leigh Tauss at ltauss@indyweek.com.\n\nWant to see more high-quality, fiercely independent journalism in the Triangle?

But sizable gaps still remain between white residents and those of color.\n\nThe report, released Wednesday morning by the Urban Institute, ranks 274 of the country\u2019s largest cities on economic health, economic inclusion and racial inclusion.\n\nThe study looks at four years: 1980, 1990, 2000 and 2013. In Louisville\u2019s case, the city-county merger happened during that period. Because of that, the study tried to maintain consistency by looking mostly at data from inside the former Louisville city limits.\n\n\u201cSo, when we\u2019re looking at the concept of an inclusive recovery, we\u2019re saying in the period of time when a city is improving its economic health, we\u2019re asking the question are they also improving the conditions and the outcomes for people of color and lower income residents in that community,\u201d said Urban Institute Vice President and Chief Innovation Officer Erika Poethig.\n\n\u201cAnd so we\u2019re seeing how those changes are happening and whether their outcomes are improving at the same time other people that have more advantages are improving.\u201d\n\nUrban Institute\n\nThe city improved 58 rankings on overall inclusion \u2014 from being ranked 252 in the nation in 1980 to 194 in 2013. When economic and racial inclusion are separated out, the city\u2019s gains for economic inclusion are even more dramatic: from 230 in the nation in 1980 to 118 in 2013.\n\nBut when it comes to racial inclusion, the city\u2019s progress has been relatively static.\n\nThe report breaks down the individual metrics that go into the rankings. Louisville became less segregated over the study period, and also made gains in shrinking the education gap between whites and people of color. Some of that is attributed to Jefferson County\u2019s school assignment program \u2014 which integrated public schools here \u2014 while programs like 15,000 Degrees get a shout out, too.\n\n(Click image to enlarge)\n\nUrban Institute\n\nBut in some aspects, racial inequality is starker now than it was in 1980. Take homeownership.\n\nIn 1980\u2019s Louisville, there was a 15 percentage point difference between people of color and whites who owned their own homes. By 2013, that divide had widened to a 32 percentage point difference: a much larger divide than seen in the country as a whole.\n\n\u201cThe gap is both growing and accelerating at a rate that is a cause of concern,\u201d Poethig said. \u201cThe leadership in the city should be focusing on what\u2019s driving that gap, but also thinking about strategies to ensure that access to capital is provided to people of color in the Metro area. Or if there are other issues that are impeding people\u2019s ability who want to become homeowners to become homeowners, to really unpack what those barriers or challenges are.\u201d\n\nUrban Institute\n\nOverall, Poethig said Louisville is an example of a city that\u2019s making gains in shrinking both income and racial gaps. And just in terms of overall economic health, the city rocketed from being ranked 252 in the nation in 1980 to 4th in the nation in 2013. That\u2019s largely due to jumps in employment and a rising overall median income \u2014 though the study noted that was helped by the merger.\n\nBut economic health isn\u2019t sustainable unless it includes people all over the city, Poethig said.\n\n\u201cUnless you\u2019re also thinking about how that health is shared across different groups, the sustainability is going to be challenged,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd so, we\u2019re hoping that people will look at this and say \u2018what are the intentional actions we can take to ensure that as we grow and we recover from economic challenges, that we can make decisions that are to the benefit of as many people as possible?\u2019\u201d\n\nTo check out how Louisville compares among other cities in the country, click here.", "title": "As Louisville\u2019s Economic Gap Shrinks, Racial Disparities Remain", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Louisville']"}, {"id": 417, "city": "['Oklahoma City']", "url": "https://oklahoman.com/article/5638020/free-bus-routes-extra-food-offered-after-smart-saver-closes-in-northeast-oklahoma-city", "text": "To help ease the blow of the Smart Saver grocery store in northeast Oklahoma City closing this week, community partners will provide free transportation services and extra food distribution to residents in need.\n\nA city health task force led by Ward 7 City Councilwoman Nikki Nice has compiled a website, neokcfood.com, listing food distribution sites and times in northeast Oklahoma City, as well as coordinating free bus rides through EMBARK and others to the Walmart Neighborhood Market on NW 23 Street west of Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\n\u201cWith one of the last major grocery stores on the northeast side closing this week, the food desert crisis deepened.

The mayor's office responded to the report by saying that the indicator does not capture the full picture of economic gains made by lower-income New Yorkers.", "title": "NYC Poverty Level Drops To Record Lows, But Income Inequality Persists", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "['poverty', 'inequality']", "annot_city": "['New York']"}, {"id": 419, "city": "['New York']", "url": "https://observer.com/2018/06/new-york-city-public-school-segregation/", "text": "Earlier this month, Mayor Bill de Blasio rolled out a plan to revamp the admissions process at eight of New York City\u2019s specialized high schools in an effort to expand diversity at the schools.\n\nIt was the closest the second-term mayor\u2014who has been reluctant to use the word \u201csegregation\u201d when discussing public schools\u2014has come to pushing for integration of the most segregated public school system in the United States. He first vowed to change the specialized high school admissions process during his first mayoral campaign in 2013.\n\nThe plan, which the mayor and New York City Schools Chancellor Richard Carranza\u2014who has taken a more aggressive stance on school segregation, even declaring that no ethnic group \u201cowns admission to these schools\u201d\u2014involves phasing out the Specialized High School Admissions Test (SHSAT). Seats would be given to the top seven percent of students from each of the city\u2019s 600 middle schools.\n\nBlack and Latino students make up nine percent of SHS offers but 68 percent of all high school students, according to the de Blasio administration. In 2016, 21 middle schools\u2014or 4 percent of all middle schools\u2014constituted 50 percent of SHS offers.\n\nWhen the test is phased out, 45 percent of offers would go to black and Latino students, compared to nine percent at the moment. Sixty-two percent of offers would go to female students, compared to 44 percent currently. The plan also revives the Discovery program, which seeks to expand enrollment of low-income students, in the city\u2019s specialized high schools.\n\nAlthough the state Assembly\u2019s education committee passed the bill that would eliminate the test, state Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie announced that he would take up the issue next session. Gov. Andrew Cuomo has yet to take a position on the plan, saying that integration is a \u201clegitimate issue\u201d and that it should be revisited as part of the debate on mayoral control of city schools next year.\n\nAlumni groups, leaders and elected officials in the Asian-American community expressed opposition to the plan on the grounds that it would take away seats from Asian students, who make up 62 percent of students at specialized high schools.\n\nThe controversial plan has reignited conversations about the longstanding segregation that has plagued the city\u2019s public school system\u2014which has 1.1 million students in more than 1,800 schools\u2014and the right approach to achieve integration.\n\nNYC Takes on Diversity\n\nIn June 2017, the city\u2019s Department of Education (DOE), which operates the public school system, released its first citywide school diversity plan.\n\nSince the release of the plan, Manhattan\u2019s District 1\u2014the Lower East Side and East Village\u2014implemented the city\u2019s first district-wide school diversity plan, according to the DOE. And Manhattan\u2019s District 3 and Brooklyn\u2019s District 15 are working on district-wide plans.\n\nThe department told Observer the plan goes hand in hand with the city\u2019s Equity in Excellence for All agenda, referring to the mayor\u2019s universal prekindergarten initiative and \u201c3K for All,\u201d which is free, fully-day early childhood education for all 3-year-old children. The department also referred to Universal Literacy, which has the goal of making sure every student is reading on grade level by the end of second grade; Algebra for All, which seeks to improve elementary and middle school math instruction; and College Access for All.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re committed to equity and excellence for all students\u2014that means high-quality, diverse schools across the city, and we are working closely with communities to make that vision a reality,\u201d Will Mantell, a DOE spokesman, said in a statement.\n\nDavid Bloomfield, professor of educational leadership, law and policy at Brooklyn College, told Observer the plan was \u201cfar and away the closest [de Blasio] has come\u201d to a citywide integration plan and that it is unclear \u201chow serious he is about this.\u201d Bloomfield also wondered why the mayor did not scrap the test at the five schools that do not require state approval.\n\nDe Blasio said his predecessor, Michael Bloomberg, \u201cignored and exacerbated the problem,\u201d referring to how school choice under Bloomberg\u2019s tenure \u201crather than mixing kids, promoted enclaves.\u201d He said people expect more from a \u201cself-described progressive mayor.\u201d\n\nHe also noted that the city\u2019s School Diversity Advisory Group\u2014which is responsible for assessing the city\u2019s school diversity plan\u2014is still deliberating.\n\nBloomfield said, \u201cI don\u2019t think you can have it both ways: use commission members to endorse a proposal while he also has them supposedly debating the proposal. And so I think in many ways de Blasio\u2019s approach to issues of segregation has been weighted toward the political rather than the educational or social justice.\u201d\n\nHe called on the mayor to call school segregation what it is\u2014once and for all.\n\n\u201cHe needs to stop blaming residential segregation for the segregation of schools,\u201d Bloomfield continued. \u201cThat would be a huge step forward. And to use clearer language. Segregation is segregation, and diversity waters down the message.\u201d\n\nTime for Change\n\nTaylor McGraw, adult facilitator for Teens Take Charge, a student-led movement for educational equity in the city, who grew up in Mississippi, said New York schools are still segregated because \u201cthey were always segregated.\u201d After the landmark 1954 Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court ruling that declared segregation in public schools unlawful, the city\u2019s 1956 integration plan fell apart due to \u201cmassive white resistance.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery time the city promotes some small integration effort, there is immediate backlash and this is\u2014people have talked about the specialized high schools\u2014it\u2019s a very dramatic example of the segregation that exists here,\u201d McGraw said.\n\nThe Hecht-Calandra bill of 1971 established the city\u2019s first four specialized high schools\u2014Stuyvesant High School, Brooklyn Technical High Schoo, Bronx High School of Science, and Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Performing Arts\u2014and required the former three schools to only use SHSAT for admission.\n\nThat test, McGraw explained, was put in place to combat discrimination and ensure that only merit is considered.\n\n\u201cFrom a policy perspective, I think it is an excellent strategy, and it\u2019s worked in higher education,\u201d he continued, referring to the mayor\u2019s plan. \u201cIt has the support of the research community in New York City.\u201d\n\nBrooklyn Assemblywoman Rodneyse Bichotte\u2014the first Haitian-American woman elected into office in the city and a graduate of LaGuardia\u2014told Observer that before the de Blasio administration came in, certain middle schools in the black and Latino communities were stripped of their gifted programs.\n\nShe contended that there is room for improvement and that she likes the mayor\u2019s \u201cradical plan,\u201d arguing that restoring the Discovery program will benefit students who are not aware of the schools.\n\nBichotte also praised de Blasio for extending seats to all middle schools because it reflects the \u201ctrue top performers.\u201d She had a 98 percent average but chose not to take the SHSAT because the tests were \u201cculturally biased,\u201d referring to her struggles with English that she said \u201cwould have been a factor of me not doing well on the test.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I was in middle school back in the late 80s, I ranked number three in my school, number three, and if this program was in place, I would have had a seat waiting for me,\u201d Bichotte said.\n\nNaomi Pe\u00f1a, a parent who serves on the Community Education Council (CEC) in District 1\u2014which serves the Lower East Side and East Village of Manhattan\u2014stressed the importance of the city taking initiative on the issue.\n\n\u201cI think on the K through 8 level, there is some sort of push on, \u2018Let it be community-led,\u2019 but it\u2019s harder to do that on the high school level because high schools are a very different animal altogether\u2026 It\u2019s harder to control aspects of a school community when you can have students that cover all five boroughs,\u201d Pe\u00f1a said.\n\nLilah Mejia, a single mother who is also in the District 1 CEC, said five of her six kids are in public school. One of her sons excelled in his classes but she skipped the SHSAT because it was a competitive and lengthy process.\n\n\u201cTo hear the mayor wanted to tackle that diversity and start off with the testing, I\u2019m excited. I think those testings are ridiculous,\u201d Mejia said. \u201cI couldn\u2019t pay for prep testing If I wanted to. Does that mean by son doesn\u2019t deserve it?\u2019\n\nJanay Daniel, a graduate student at New York University\u2019s Graduate School of Public Service who has been working in the public and charter school systems for nearly 10 years, grew up in a low-income community in Brooklyn and took the SHSAT but did not get in because her test score was not high enough.\n\nShe attended Bard High School Early College, a four-year public school that provides students with a two-year tuition-free college course of study.\n\n\u201cI was very privileged to be able to have a quality education that allowed me to go to a great university that really launched my career, but there are a lot of students in New York City who do not have the same privilege of getting into a quality high school if they do not get into a specialized high school,\u201d Daniel said.\n\nIt\u2019s the Wrong Approach\n\nFormer Bronx Assemblyman Michael Benjamin, a member of the editorial board of the New York Post who attended Bronx Science, blasted the mayor\u2019s plan.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t understand why he rolled it out so late in the legislative session,\u201d Benjamin said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t\u2014in my mind\u2014acknowledge, engage the various\u2026communities about this plan.\u201d\n\nDavid Lee, education committee chair of the Chinese American Citizens Alliance of Greater New York, graduated from Brooklyn Tech in 1978. He told Observer that before his class, the school was majority white but in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, it was majority black and Hispanic because there were honors classes in elementary and middle schools. Despite the fact that the current test was codified into law in 1971, a test has been in use for the last 90 years, he explained.\n\n\u201cIn the absence of the \u2018Special Progress\u2019 classes and honors classes, the Asian community\u2014they found a replacement for it, they found a solution for the lack of these rigorous classes, and that was the enrichment classes, after-school weekend classes,\u201d he said.\n\nHe opposes the mayor\u2019s plan, pointing to a study conducted by Sean Corcoran, associate professor of economics and education policy at NYU, that shows that any method other than the test would bring down the schools\u2019 academic rigor.\n\nDOE told Observer the average GPA of a student in the top seven percent of their class, at 94 percent\u2014the same as students who received an SHS offer this year. The average state test score of a student in the top 7 percent of their class is 3.9, about the same as students who got an SHS offer this year, at 4.1 on a 1 to 4.5 scale.\n\nState Assemblywoman Yuh-Line Niou, who represents Lower Manhattan, said that while the school system is \u201cvery, very segregated,\u201d specialized high schools are majority-minority because most of the students are Asian.\n\nShe referred to DOE\u2019s plan to increase diversity in Community School District 1 that involves a school choice system. And she noted that it is hard to get into specialized high schools if students do not attend the \u201cfeeder\u201d middle schools that guarantee admission to them.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s like over half of the specialized seats go to\u2026 20 middle schools, and if you go to an elementary [school] that can\u2019t get you into those, then your chances are greatly reduced,\u201d Niou noted.\n\nParent advocate Mona Davids, president of the New York City Parents Union\u2014whose daughter graduated from LaGuardia two years ago\u2014called the mayor\u2019s plan an \u201cavoidance scheme\u201d and accused him of refusing to address the root of the problem, which she says is K-8 education.\n\n\u201cThe fact of the matter is that the majority of students, especially black and Latino students in the public school system are not reading, writing and doing math at grade-level, and this does not start in the eighth grade,\u201d Davids said. \u201cThis starts in the elementary schools, both elementary and middle schools.\u201d\n\nAnd she noted there are other \u201cgreat\u201d public high schools that do not require a test that are segregated, pointing to schools like Bard High School Early College, Hunter College High School, Townsend Harris High School, and Beacon High School.\n\nBrooklyn Councilman Mark Treyger, chairman of the Council\u2019s Committee on Education and a former public school teacher, believes segregation is a \u201cvery serious problem\u201d but that it has to be addressed and fixed in an \u201cinclusive and meaningful way.\u201d\n\n\u201cIntegration should start sooner than the ninth grade in a few schools that make up under two percent of our entire student body,\u201d Treyger said. \u201cSo with all due respect to the mayor, this was more of a two percent-plan at the 11th hour because there were only 11 days left in session in Albany.\u201d\n\nThe current plan, he noted, does not include enrichment programs and expansion of Gifted & Talented (G&T) programs\u2014which supports exceptional students in kindergarten through fifth grade\u2014in communities of color. DOE said the administration added G&T classes so there is an option in every district.\n\nSo how do we end segregation?\n\nThe debate over the admissions process for specialized high schools exposed the myriad views\u2014and widespread division\u2014on how the city should achieve integration of the public school system. For McGraw, the process of integration starts with \u201csomething pretty simple\u201d: aiming to amplify integration as much as possible.\n\n\u201cYou have to adopt the philosophy that our guiding principle when we think about school policy is going to be to maximize integration in every possible way at every possible level, and we have not seen that at all,\u201d he said.\n\nUnder the previous chancellor, Carmen Fari\u00f1a, he said, the policy was to let integration happen organically, noting that in areas such as District 1 and District 15, parent advocates and school leaders \u201chave made some headway.\u201d\n\nIntegration, McGraw said, could come in the form of redrawing school zone lines or getting rid of them as well as bussing.\n\nJorge Morales, 18, a senior at New Heights Academy Charter School in Harlem and a Teens Take Charge leader, told Observer his school is 96 percent Latino and about three percent black. He is part of Teens Take Charge\u2019s policy team.\n\n\u201cWe focus a lot on high school admissions and how we can develop a proposal to ensure that our high schools are diverse\u2026 High schoolers are able to travel in different places all over the city,\u201d Morales said.\n\nPe\u00f1a similarly called for a change in mindset\u2014she urged people to put aside their privilege and show empathy toward other families and students.\n\n\u201cThis work requires ownership of your personal feelings and your biases, and that\u2019s messy, that\u2019s very messy work,\u201d she said, adding that parents are often fixated on what they want \u201cversus what\u2019s right.\u201d\n\nShe also said people have to change their mindsets as far as what constitutes a good school, noting that just because alumni attended Ivy League schools does not mean that other high schools \u201caren\u2019t as capable of doing the same.\u201d As to DOE, she said the department has struggled with transparency and communication.\n\nMejia said teachers need to become aware of different students\u2019 circumstances.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s having more training for teachers who come into these black and brown neighborhoods who are not aware of the culture, the struggle,\u201d she said, giving the example of ensuring kids who live in shelters get meals.\n\nOthers called for zoning reform. Bloomfield said the community school districts were set up along racial and ethnic lines. He also called for greater curricular opportunities at low-performing schools.\n\n\u201cThere needs to be a citywide effort\u2026 that citywide effort has to entail both a technical approach to zoning and other issues as well as community outreach,\u201d he said.\n\nIndeed, Daniel called for the entire high school process to be an open enrollment process in which students can pick schools based on location and career interests, for example. But she conceded it would be a tough endeavor, referring to parents on the Upper West Side who were \u201cinfuriated\u201d over a plan first reported by NY1 that seeks to integrate middle schools in the neighborhood.\n\nHer own parents did not want her to go to her zoned middle and high schools due to the quality of the education.\n\n\u201cI think the zoning process is honestly one of the most dated systems in our city, and I think it has allowed segregation to persist in New York City public high schools,\u201d Daniel said.\n\nOthers were skeptical of the push for a citywide integration plan. While Lee supports integration, he wondered whether it is what parents in the city want. He says he does not support \u201cforced integration.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey really want to attend schools in their communities, but they want the quality, they want the quality,\u201d he said. \u201cSo a parent will send their kid to another district to attend a school because of the quality. But you have to imagine that if they had a choice, a quality school in their own neighborhood, they would like to stay in their neighborhood.\u201d\n\nBenjamin says the solution is improving middle schools as well as education overall in neighborhoods that are majority black and Latino. And he added that screened schools\u2014schools that have discretion over who is admitted\u2014have low proportions of black and Hispanic kids.\n\n\u201cIntegration at this point in time is a red herring,\u201d Benjamin said, calling the screened schools the real problem. \u201cIn school districts where you can show where black and Hispanic kids are being sort of screened out, then that needs to be overcome.\u201d\n\nHe pointed to a study by The New School\u2019s Center for New York City Affairs that found that 40 percent of black parents are opting their children out of their neighborhood school. He also noted parents are opting their children out of public schools and that a number of black and Hispanic kids are going into Prep for Prep, a leadership development program that gives students of color access to private school education.\n\n\u201cCarranza and de Blasio don\u2019t seem to get that,\u201d Benjamin maintained. \u201cThey\u2019d rather focus on phony social justice issues rather than the core mission of educating children well and attracting their parents to want to be a part of the city school system.\u201d", "title": "NYC Has the Most Segregated Schools in the Country. How Do We Fix That?", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "['inequality', 'school']", "annot_city": "['New York']"}, {"id": 420, "city": "['Los Angeles']", "url": "https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-rothstein-segregated-housing-20170820-story.html", "text": "Every metropolitan area in the nation is racially segregated, and Los Angeles is no exception. We tolerate residential segregation because we\u2019re convinced that it happened informally \u2014 because of personal choices and private discrimination. But what cemented our separate neighborhoods is something most of us have forgotten \u2014 government\u2019s unconstitutional and systematic insistence on segregated housing in the mid-20th century, establishing patterns that persist to this day.\n\nThe 2010 census data show that 60% of Los Angeles\u2019s African Americans live in neighborhoods where few whites are present. The exposure of blacks to whites is as minimal as it is in Chicago or Newark; concentrated African American poverty is as common in L.A. as in New York or Pittsburgh.\n\nThe New Deal created the nation\u2019s first civilian public housing in the 1930s, segregated not only in the South, but nationwide. In his autobiography, the African American poet Langston Hughes recounted his adolescence in World War I Cleveland, where he dated a Jewish girl and his best friend was Polish. But during the Depression, the Public Works Administration demolished a part of that mixed neighborhood and built separate white and black projects, creating segregation where it hadn\u2019t previously existed.\n\nDuring World War II, more than 10,000 African American families moved to Los Angeles for jobs in military production, and government-mandated segregation moved west. Desperate for labor, companies were hiring black workers for the first time, yet unless these migrants could find housing, war mobilization would stall. Although the city\u2019s public housing authority had vacancies in white neighborhoods, it denied them to African Americans. The federal government had to intervene.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDouglas Aircraft in Santa Monica employed 44,000 workers. When Washington proposed a Venice housing project, white residents objected to African Americans living nearby. When one was planned in Compton, also then all-white, there were more protests. The government relocated both projects to Watts. Before the war, Watts had been integrated, with about equal numbers of whites, blacks and Latinos. By 1958, it was 95% black. Public housing policy was largely responsible for this segregation.\n\nWhite homeowners gained, over succeeding generations, hundreds of thousands of dollars from rising equity; African American renters did not.\n\nSuburban expansion financed by the Federal Housing Administration, another New Deal agency, was also discriminatory. In the Los Angeles area, Panorama City, developed by Henry J. Kaiser in the late 1940s, and Lakewood, developed by Mark Taper and his partners, were FHA-supported on explicit condition that African Americans be barred. FHA rules stated that \u201cincompatible racial elements\u201d would disqualify builders from essential federally backed loans. The FHA also frequently required that property deeds prohibit resale to African Americans.\n\nOther federal programs reinforced segregation. The IRS should have denied tax-exempt status to nonprofit institutions that discriminated on the basis of race, yet it systematically did the opposite in Los Angeles and elsewhere. The pastor of the Wilshire Presbyterian Church led a campaign to bar African Americans from his congregation\u2019s neighborhood, and he personally sued to evict a black war veteran who had moved there in violation of a racial deed restriction. Whittier College, historically a Quaker school, participated in a neighborhood compact in which homeowners agreed not to sell property to African Americans. Both church and college kept their tax exemptions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn smaller ways, local government contributed. In 1943, Culver City convened a meeting of air raid wardens whose job was to ensure that families dimmed evening lights to prevent Japanese bombers from finding targets. The city attorney instructed the wardens also to press homeowners to sign pledges never to sell to African Americans.\n\nIn 1948, a black family moved to all-white Eagle Rock. A police officer led a mob that included Chamber of Commerce members and the local Kiwanis president to burn a cross on an adjacent lot. The officer was in uniform, confident that his superiors approved. From 1950 to the 1965 Watts riots, more than 100 bombing and vandalism incidents attempted to eject African Americans from white L.A. neighborhoods, but just one arrest and prosecution resulted, and that happened only because the California attorney general intervened when local prosecutors claimed police could not identify the perpetrators.\n\nIn 1968, Congress adopted the Fair Housing Act, prohibiting discrimination in the sale and rental of housing; it added enforcement procedures 20 years later. But the law only affected future discrimination; it did nothing to undo the segregation that government had spent the previous 35 years imposing.\n\nNationally, homes in FHA subdivisions built in the mid-20th century typically sold for about $100,000 in today\u2019s currency; they would have been affordable to black working-class families. But, denied the opportunity to buy them, most African Americans were forced to rent, often in cities from which jobs subsequently disappeared. White homeowners gained, over succeeding generations, hundreds of thousands of dollars from rising equity; African American renters did not. Today, average national black income is 60% of whites\u2019 but average black wealth is only 7% of whites\u2019, a disparity mostly resulting from unconstitutional federal housing policy. (Those mid-century FHA homes, which today sell for $300,000 and often much more, are now out of reach for working-class families of any race.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOur entrenched residential segregation exacerbates serious political, social and economic problems. It traps the most disadvantaged young African American men in high-poverty neighborhoods, with inadequate access to good jobs or education, where police function as an occupying force. It impedes upward mobility: Low-income African American children in segregated neighborhoods are more likely to remain poor as adults than similarly low-income African American children raised in more diverse neighborhoods.\n\nAnd segregation defeats efforts to close the black-white academic gap. Teachers can devote special attention to a few children who are in poor health, or stressed because of family economic instability, or who have had inadequate early childhood learning experiences. But in schools where most pupils suffer from such challenges, instruction becomes mostly remedial and behavioral problems erode teaching time.\n\nTo overturn these patterns requires measures designed specifically to remedy government\u2019s earlier imposition of segregation. For example, municipalities should repeal zoning laws that use criteria such as density level and lot size to prohibit apartments and even modest single family homes and townhouses from being built in affluent white neighborhoods. Rental subsidies need to be set on a sliding scale so low-income families can afford to live in middle-class communities.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe should now insist on integration as aggressively as we did segregation in the last century.

It\u2019s one of the main issues in union negotiations that have led Chicago Public School teachers and support staff to strike on Thursday, October 17.\n\nThe Chicago Teachers Union, which represents more than 25,000 teachers and staff, still hasn\u2019t resolved issues involving pay and staffing in addition to more contentious topics like housing and ensuring there\u2019s a librarian in every school.\n\nThe union representing Chicago Park District workers were expected to strike along with CTU complicating contingency plans for more than 300,000 students, but earlier on Wednesday they reached an agreement with the city.\n\nThe next contract with the city will have to be about more than just pay and benefits\u2014the union wants housing assistance for teachers and students. Lightfoot says affordable housing should be addressed broadly and it isn\u2019t an \u201cappropriate place for the city to legislate its affordable housing policy.\u201d\n\nBut leaders and members at CTU disagree. Some of what the union is proposing includes more staff to support families in danger of losing housing and a program that financially helps school employees purchase homes.\n\nAbout 16,000 Chicago Public School students are homeless, CTU President Jesse Sharkey said during a WTTW interview. Housing is relevant to the negotiation as CPS employees are required to live within city limits, but many can\u2019t afford it, he said. Plus, other city employees like police and firefighters get housing assistance while teachers do not.\n\nAfter a wave of teachers\u2019 strikes, the cost of living and housing issues aren\u2019t new to contract negotiations. In Oakland, California teachers cited skyrocketing rents as one of their main concerns.\n\nA look into the Chicago rental market shows that the amount of affordable housing in the city is shrinking, even though low-income households represent the largest share of renters.\n\nIn Chicago, the union was also critical of massive development projects increasing rents and developers that avoid building required affordable housing by opting to pay a fee. The increased cost of living has led to a decline in student enrollment, especially among black families, CTU said.\n\n\"We are in one of the richest cities, one of the richest countries in the whole world, where tax payers have subsidized the development of sky scrappers but can not give black children on the south side a smaller class size\" @stacydavisgates spitting on the @CTULocal1 strike pic.twitter.com/tWhxuToQBb \u2014 agitator in chief (@soit_goes) October 16, 2019\n\nComparing the city\u2019s massive breaks for developers against the stingy deals for Chicago students and teachers continues to be a main argument for CTU.\n\n\u201cThe money is always there for places like Lincoln Yards and The 78.

Despite a downturn in oil prices, the real estate market has continued to set price records\u2014to the joy of sellers and brokers, but to the dismay of buyers and renters.\n\nAffordability has long been one of the Bayou City\u2019s prime selling points. Houston may have been polluted, mosquito-infested, traffic-choked, swelteringly humid, subject to frequent biblical deluges, and overrun by gigantic flying cockroaches, but the houses were cheap. On paper at least, there were few better places to achieve the American Dream.\n\nNot so much anymore. According to a Harvard University survey, Greater Houston\u2019s 2017 home-price-to-income ratio of 3.7 is the highest it has ever been, and well above the \u201cgolden rule\u201d of home affordability (that your monthly home payment not exceed 28 percent of your income).\n\nThe old adage \u201cDrive until you qualify\u201d is increasingly stretched to the point of absurdity when you consider that Houston\u2014the city proper, plus the surrounding towns and the contiguous unincorporated sprawl of strip malls, feeder roads, parking lots, and housing developments\u2014now fills the entirety of the land between the floodplains of the Trinity River to the east and those of Big Brazos to the west. It\u2019s at those fringes, far-flung locales deeper and deeper in the Piney Woods to the north and the storm-wracked coastal prairies to the south, that you can still find three-bedroom, two-bath starter homes under $200,000.\n\nIt\u2019s also in select transitional neighborhoods closer to the city center, where more and more often families find themselves beaten to the punch by institutional investors who transform properties into rentals or raze and replace them with townhouses.\n\nInvestors have long enjoyed a significant advantage over traditional homebuyers\u2014namely, lots of cash. Now they\u2019ve seized the advantage of time too. High-tech data-mining companies like Houston-based Entera can feed thousands of data points about a property, sight-unseen, into an algorithm in seconds and then market that property to an investor who can, and often does, buy it without so much as a drive-by. According to a recent Houston Chronicle article, Blackstone and American Homes 4 Rent, two of the country\u2019s largest real estate investment trusts, work with Entera. Between them, the companies have purchased at least 5,800 Houston homes in recent years.\n\nHow can a traditional homebuyer\u2014who spends hours upon hours poring over listings online, additional hours driving around, and hours more at open houses and showings\u2014compete with that? Most often, they can\u2019t\u2014especially in the case of people on limited incomes in search of a unicorn of a first home. Entera likes it that way. \u201cWe hope we\u2019re very hard to compete against,\u201d the company\u2019s co-founder, Robert Salmons, told the Chronicle.\n\nMeanwhile, according to the Kinder Institute, a Rice University\u2013affiliated think tank, nearly 306,000 Harris County households face severe problems (including a lack of kitchen or bathroom facilities, high costs, or overcrowding). Almost 215,000 Houston households spend more than half of their income on housing, and only eighteen affordable housing units exist for every one hundred extremely low-income households in the Greater Houston area, the nation\u2019s third-worst ratio.\n\nGiven all that, the famously no-zoning, laissez-faire H-Town is enacting measures that would once have been considered unthinkable. Prominent among them was the formation last year of the Houston Community Land Trust, an independent nonprofit that has partnered with the city government to, in its words, \u201cmake affordable homeownership achievable for limited-income households in Houston, Texas.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how a CLT works: Qualified homebuyers with an average monthly household income at or below 80 percent of the area\u2019s median income (adjusted for family size) can buy a home from the trust at a below-market price. The homeowner gets a deed to the house and a 99-year, renewable, inheritable lease on the land, over which the trust retains ownership in perpetuity. The buyer must also agree to a cap on the property\u2019s resale value\u2014increasing no more than 1.25 percent annually\u2014so that it remains affordable whenever it hits the market again.\n\nCourtesy of The Houston Community Land Trust\n\nThe largest, and perhaps best known, CLT in America today is the Champlain Housing Trust, a Vermont organization founded in 1984 with the vigorous assistance of then-Burlington mayor Bernie Sanders. Texas\u2019s own first community land trust, run through the Guadalupe Neighborhood Development Corporation, formed as a brake on gentrification in historically black and Hispanic East Austin. It built its first land-trust property in 2012, the year after the state enacted a property tax exemption for land-trust homes that made the arrangement even more affordable for potential buyers.\n\nHouston\u2019s plan calls for 1,100 homes to be built and sold before 2024\u2014still just a drop in the bucket when it comes to addressing the city\u2019s affordable housing crunch. The trust\u2019s first offerings\u2014six new three-bedroom, two-bath houses in the northwest Acres Homes neighborhood\u2014are on the market for about $75,000 each. That price would result in monthly payments between $785 and $1,000, depending on the mortgage terms. One of the houses is already under contract, with the sale expected to close by the beginning of June.\n\nHCLT\u2019s executive director, Ashley Allen, was surprised by Houston\u2019s dearth of cheap housing when she relocated from Chicago. \u201cEven with a decent salary, decent credit, still my options were limited by income,\u201d she said. \u201cSo that got me to thinking: If this is a struggle for me, what is it like for those who are making a little bit over minimum wage, or even those people who are making a decent salary, something like $35,000 to $40,000? The salaries are not keeping up with the rents.\u201d\n\nImagine a family forced to move from apartment to apartment because rents go up 3 percent a year while incomes rise just one percent or less. Now picture that same family in an affordable home of its own year after year. Such stability does enormous good.\n\n\u201cWhen they go to look at homes, they\u2019re wondering \u2018What happened to the starter homes of yesteryear?\u2019 In most cases those are now $180,000 to $200,000. So what does that mean for hardworking individuals and families?\u201d Allen asks. \u201cIt\u2019s either continue to rent, get a home that needs significant repair\u2014which ends up costing you more money\u2014or you end up getting placed out of your own community, which could mean away from where you work and where your family is. The people who\u2019ve made the communities what they are don\u2019t even have the opportunity to buy [there].\u201d\n\nFor children, being forced to move means leaving the neighborhood entirely and having to start over in a new school. City of Houston Housing and Community Development director Tom McCasland says children frequently uprooted and relocated are at a distinct disadvantage from those with more stable homes.\n\n\u201cThe education folks tell me that\u2019s the single most important indicator in predicting whether or not someone will graduate from high school,\u201d he says. \u201cAnchoring a family to the community, that provides a benefit to the community, and that anchoring provides a significant benefit to the kids in the household by giving them the stability that they need through their school years.\u201d\n\nIn central Houston, these problems aren\u2019t limited to minority-majority neighborhoods like the Wards, but also artsy, predominantly white districts like Montrose and the Heights. Affordable apartment projects have been defeated by NIMBYish uprisings in prime Houston neighborhoods in recent years. The local aversion to such developments, even sparkling new ones for prescreened renters, approaches the level of phobia.\n\nMcCasland believes that the HCLT model won\u2019t be met with a similar degree of fear and loathing. \u201cHouston is a city of single-family homes, and we have a lot of them. It\u2019s seen as an American Dream thing, and I haven\u2019t heard the same sort of opposition to this program as we\u2019ve seen regarding affordable apartments coming into certain neighborhoods, even if the residents of those homes are at the same income level,\u201d he says.\n\nIn a city as geographically widespread as Houston, with famously lackluster public transit, the working poor can feasibly move only so far from job centers like the Med Center and downtown. So turning every neighborhood inside Loop 610 or Beltway 8 into townhouse-dotted, yoga studio-enhanced yuppie enclaves is not a wise option\u2014not today, nor in the decades to come. Given that, Allen said, why not provide an opportunity for the working poor to stabilize their lives and build equity instead of leaving them at the mercies of the free market and ever-rising rents?\n\n\u201cThis is a long-term tool that\u2019s been in use for decades to stop displacement and gentrification,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore people make a judgment on it, they need to educate themselves on it, look at the bigger picture, and figure out who it\u2019s helping.\u201d\n\nIn Houston, that\u2019s everyone from service industry workers to city employees to first responders and teachers, some of whom are forced to get by on a single income.\n\n\u201cFor that working mom who has an income that can carry a $75,000 mortgage on a three-bedroom home, this is a dream come true, if they can get that mortgage,\u201d McCasland said. \u201cThey can give their kids that backyard they were looking for and be close to the school where they want their kids to go.\u201d\n\nSo the American Dream, Houston version, may not be dead after all\u2014flying cockroaches be damned.", "title": "Houston Has an Aggressive, Radical Plan to Sell Affordable Housing", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "['housing']", "annot_city": "['Houston']"}, {"id": 424, "city": "['Phoenix']", "url": "https://eu.azcentral.com/story/money/real-estate/catherine-reagor/2018/09/30/phoenix-apartments-called-first-place-adults-autism-opens/1421650002/", "text": "New Phoenix apartments open for adults with autism\n\nAnother new apartment complex recently opened up in central Phoenix.

Across the United States, most lower-income households spend more than half of what they make each month on housing costs, according to \u201cThe State of the Nation\u2019s Housing 2018,\u201d a report from Harvard University\u2019s Joint Center for Housing Studies.\n\nBut in Philadelphia, it\u2019s not just a shortage of affordable housing that\u2019s causing the crunch. Instead, poor-quality houses and an unusually high poverty rate \u2014 about 400,000 Philadelphians are living in poverty \u2014 tilt the equation so that demand far outstrips supply here, making affordable homes hard to obtain and difficult to manage.\n\nTo the uninitiated, the data in the Joint Center for Housing Studies\u2019 annual report, released in June, might seem alarming. Among other statistics, the report states that affordable units for low-income renters both nationwide and in the 11-county Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington region have become 50 percent more scarce over the last 10 years. The data point to a regional deficit of 117,132 affordable rentals.\n\nAt the same time, overall for-sale housing inventory in the region \u2014 as measured by a standard called months of supply\u2014 has dropped to 2.6 months, a historic all-time low, according to the report and data from real estate firm Houwzer LLC. Six months\u2019 supply is considered balanced.\n\nThis hot seller\u2019s market has contributed to higher prices. Home values in the city of Philadelphia alone have jumped more than 11 percent in the last year, to a median of just above $147,000, according to real estate search engine Zillow.\n\nObservers intimately acquainted with the local housing market were quick to alleviate concerns the data in the Joint Center\u2019s report might raise. (Most of the data break down only by the 11-county Philadelphia region, not for Philadelphia County specifically.)\n\nPhiladelphia is the most affordable city in the Northeast Corridor aside from Baltimore, said Kevin Gillen, a housing expert and economist at Drexel University\u2019s Lindy Institute for Urban Innovation.\n\nFor housing to be considered affordable, the level of household income going toward costs such as mortgage payments, utilities, maintenance, and property taxes should be less than 35 percent, Gillen said. In Philadelphia, that figure hovers around 34 percent, just below the moderately unaffordable cut-off. For context, San Francisco and New York are in the 50 to 60 percent, or severely unaffordable, bracket.\n\nHow can Philadelphia be so affordable at the same time affordable housing is so scarce in the city?\n\n\u201cThere are a large number of relatively affordable neighborhoods across the city\u2026 [but] we have a lot of housing that\u2019s not affordable to a lot of poor people because they are in poverty,\u201d said Alan Greenberger, the city\u2019s former deputy mayor and a housing-policy expert at Drexel\u2019s Lindy Institute.\n\nPhiladelphia\u2019s poverty rate is 25.7 percent, the highest among the 10 largest U.S. cities, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts. The Joint Center for Housing Studies report defines extremely low-income renters as those making less than 30 percent of the area median income, which is about $26,000 a year in Philadelphia, slightly above the federal poverty line (which is just under $20,000 a year for a family of four). To be considered affordable for extremely low-income Philadelphians, then, average monthly rent should be about or below $650 per month.\n\nThough his statement about unaffordability and poverty may sound like a semantic distinction, Greenberger argued that high poverty makes the problems here different from those of metropolitan areas like New York and Boston.\n\nAffordable is a relative term, Philadelphia\u2019s housing situation suggests.\n\nTimothy Henkel, senior vice president of Pennrose Properties, one of the few private-sector affordable-housing developers active in the Philadelphia market, agreed with Greenberger\u2019s conclusion. High poverty rates are driving changes in the affordable-housing equation across the country, but Philadelphia is feeling the squeeze more acutely than most, Henkel said.\n\nProspective homeowners need to take into account their savings and credit scores when considering a purchase. Without financial counseling, would-be buyers are often unaware of the types of homes they can reasonably afford, said Maureen Keown, a spokeswoman for the Philadelphia-based nonprofit financial-counseling service Clarifi. Some of the more affordable neighborhoods in the city include Grays Ferry and Port Richmond; Mount Airy, Graduate Hospital, and Fishtown are in the more middle-cost housing range.\n\nThe city\u2019s elderly housing stock exacerbates the unaffordability caused by poverty, Gillen said. The median age of a house in Philadelphia is 93 years old \u2014 nearly thirty years older than the average median home age across the country, according to data compiled by the National Trust\u2019s Preservation Green Lab. (The median is the middle number; half the houses are older, half newer.) So even if Philadelphians can afford homes, their quality is frequently substandard because the city\u2019s housing stock is old and depreciated, Gillen said.\n\nMany Philadelphia rowhouses were constructed as worker housing and were not intended to last for more than 100 years, Greenberger said \u2014 they need new boilers and electric systems, replacement for cornices that have fallen off, insulation, paint jobs, and other repairs.\n\nSuch properties are \u201cnaturally occurring affordable housing,\u201d Henkel said, because they are privately held and affordable without income or deed restrictions. They need expensive repairs, and \u201cthere\u2019s no math that makes sense\u2026 to take out a loan\u2026 and then turn around and rent [a unit] on the same level,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe need to make reinvestments in these properties,\u201d Greenberger said.\n\nThe cost of improving and reinvesting in old houses can lead to gentrification and displacement, however. Landlords face pressure either to raise rents or allow homes to continue their decline, Henkel said.\n\nThere are policy solutions that can ease the burden of gentrification, improve housing quality, and increase the rate of affordable-housing construction, Greenberger said.\n\nBut he added, \u201cWe probably need to do a better job as a city to make people aware of those programs.\u201d\n\nAmong such initiatives are the Longtime Owner Occupants Program (LOOP) and the Real Estate Tax Deferral Program, according to information provided by Paul Chrystie, deputy director of communications for city\u2019s Department of Planning and Development. Such programs allow homeowners without cash on hand to wait until they can receive the benefits of their property\u2019s higher value before paying the necessary taxes, Greenberger said.\n\nFor example, under the Real Estate Tax Deferral Program, if the value of a homeowner\u2019s property increases by more than 15 percent in a year, that homeowner may be able to postpone payment of taxes on the excess amount until the home is sold.\n\nLOOP is an income-based real estate tax abatement for residents who have owned their homes for more than 10 years. If a property\u2019s value increases more than 300 percent in a year, the homeowner may be eligible for the tax abatement, according to the information provided by Chrystie.\n\nTo help with housing quality, the city also has a Basic Systems Repair Program, Greenberger said. Under the program, homeowners with a maximum annual income of $37,650 for a family of four are eligible for free boiler and heating repairs, as well as roof replacement in some cases of major interior damage.\n\nRenters are in a more precarious position, Gillen said. Without help from the city and state, it\u2019s much more difficult for renters to avoid the effects of rising property values, Greenberger noted.\n\nThat\u2019s where private-sector affordable-housing developers like Pennrose come in: They can build new units to meet the demand, if they take advantage of incentives provided by the state.\n\nThose incentives include 4 percent and 9 percent tax-credit deals, Greenberger said. While 4 percent tax credits are common, they often do not provide enough revenue to be lucrative for private-sector developers. Nine percent deals are more useful but less common, he said. The tax credits allow developers to reduce their federal taxes once affordable units are put into service, and the developers can market the credits to investors, according to the Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency.\n\nZoning bonuses that encourage developers to allocate certain percentages of their projects to affordable housing are also often successful, but \u201cthese zoning bonuses tend to exist downtown\u2026 and produce small numbers of units,\u201d Greenberger said.\n\nFor private-sector developers, \u201cthere are some barriers to entry, some of them real, some of them perceived,\u201d Henkel said, calling Philadelphia a \u201chigh-cost environment\u201d with construction costs that can often scare off developers.\n\nPennsylvania\u2019s state government has done a lot in recent years to create resources for developers, including some increased funding of affordable-housing projects, but that has not meant a dramatic uptick in new players in the Philadelphia market, Henkel said.\n\n\u201cThe state is doing better, but there haven\u2019t been huge commitments to gap-fund new construction projects,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just clearly not viewed as fertile ground.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Henkel is excited about the city\u2019s future. Philadelphia has worked to create overlay zoning that allows upzoning with affordable housing, which creates more inclusionary projects. \u201cThose will increase affordable-housing supply, and it will also increase it in places that might not have gotten any at all,\u201d he said.\n\nA hub of affordable housing, public green space, and a nonprofit justice center will spring up over several blocks in Chinatown in the coming years, pending approval of a project proposed by Pennrose. The affordable housing and justice center were included thanks to the city\u2019s recent efforts to include social-impact criteria in the Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority\u2019s requests for proposals, which give points to projects that meet those criteria, Henkel said.\n\n\u201cThis was the first RFP where we included in our scoring a factor called social impact\u2026 and that means the developer has to give us a narrative where they explain what is the project\u2019s social impact,\u201d said Gregory Heller, who leads the Redevelopment Authority.\n\nThe Chinatown proposal was selected about a year ago, and Henkel said it could be approved by the Redevelopment Authority in the fall. Pennrose has hosted community meetings to discuss the finer details, and another meeting is scheduled for August.\n\nThe project, at 800-30 Vine St., is a small light in a dim sky, though \u2014 it exemplifies the mixed-use, community-focused affordable-housing mentality Henkel espouses, but it will offer just 55 to 65 units of senior affordable housing. It also will offer 160 rental units that are not designated affordable housing and are expected to rent between $1,500 and $2,200 a month.\n\nA number of other planned developments offer similar numbers of units. The city will soon be cutting the ribbon for two new affordable-housing projects\u2014 Anthony Wayne Phase III and Centennial Village, Heller said. The projects will provide between 45 and 60 affordable units apiece; the wait list for a unit in Centennial Village is more than three years long.\n\nLast year, the state awarded tax credits to developers for eight different projects across Philadelphia, but those will create only 475 additional units total in a region that, according to the JCHS report, requires an additional 116,000-plus.\n\nThe Redevelopment Authority, the Philadelphia Land Bank, and other city development organizations are trying to be conscious of affordable-housing needs when evaluating future development projects, Heller said.\n\n\u2014", "title": "Old homes, high poverty make Philadelphia housing less than affordable for some", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "['housing', 'poverty']", "annot_city": "['Philadelphia']"}, {"id": 426, "city": "['San Antonio']", "url": "https://sanantonio.culturemap.com/news/real-estate/09-30-19-risk-of-housing-downturn-in-next-recession-says-study-redfin/", "text": "Rumblings about an impending recession are agitating the U.S. economy \u2014 including the housing market. And when the next recession actually hits, San Antonio\u2019s housing sector could be one of the hardest-hit metro markets in the country, a new study indicates.\n\nSan Antonio shows up at No. 9 on a ranking by residential real estate brokerage Redfin of the major U.S. metro areas facing the greatest risk of a housing slump during the next recession. By comparison, Houston ranks 20th, Dallas ranks 22nd, and Austin ranks 25th.\n\nIn its study, Redfin looked at seven recession-related factors for each of the country\u2019s 50 largest metro areas. They included volatility of home prices, share of homes that are \u201cflipped\u201d for investment purposes, and diversity of employers.\n\nEach factor was assigned a different weight, and Redfin then calculated those percentages to determine a risk score for each metro. San Antonio\u2019s was 63.2; the lower the number, the less risk there is.\n\n\u201cSan Antonio\u2019s housing market is at a high risk [in a] recession because home prices in San Antonio are quite volatile, and a high number of sales in San Antonio are flips,\u201d Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin, tells CultureMap.\n\n\u201cHome price volatility puts a metro at risk because any downturn in home prices would be more extreme in a more volatile market,\u201d Fairweather adds. \u201cA high number of home flips puts a metro at risk because flippers would be the first to slash prices when the market turns down, unlike homes that are owner-occupied and can stay in place and weather an economic downturn.\u201d\n\nGrant Lopez, chairman of the San Antonio Board of Realtors, say he\u2019s surprised by San Antonio\u2019s appearance in the top 10, given that the region\u2019s housing market stayed in good shape during the last recession, and the area\u2019s population and economy are surging.\n\nStill, Lopez says the Redfin ranking is no cause for alarm. During the Great Recession, which stretched from 2007 to 2009, the San Antonio home market saw the pace of home sales decline and the value of homes remain steady, he points out. Lopez expects the same pattern during the next recession.\n\n\u201cI always call San Antonio a very healthy market,\u201d Lopez tells CultureMap. \u201cI strategically use that word \u2018healthy,\u2019 because I don\u2019t think we\u2019re a volatile market like some of the other metros in Texas where they go dramatically high and dramatically low. We\u2019re not a rollercoaster city.\u201d\n\nLopez notes that San Antonio\u2019s small inventory of million-dollar-plus homes \u2014 whose sales tend to lag during an economic downturn \u2014 helps shield it from wild swings in the housing market. In August, 93.7 percent of the homes sold in the area were priced below $500,000, according to SABOR.\n\nOverall, San Antonio\u2019s home market posted solid numbers in August, with the median home price rising three percent to $238,400 versus a year earlier and total sales jumping seven percent to 3,440, says SABOR.\n\n\u201cIn San Antonio\u2019s market, a recession does not mean panic mode,\u201d Lopez says.\n\nRedfin\u2019s Fairweather encourages buyers and sellers of homes in the San Antonio area to approach housing decisions carefully during the next U.S. recession, which many economists predict will arrive in 2020 or 2021.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re a homeowner who doesn\u2019t sweat mortgage payments and feels secure in your job, then a recession isn\u2019t worth losing sleep over,\u201d Fairweather says. \u201cIf you\u2019re already looking to buy or sell, I wouldn\u2019t recommend waiting for any major market changes.

In his\u201dState of the City\u201d speech on Tuesday night, Mayor Kevin Faulconer outlined his plans to spur the development of more housing.\n\n\u201cI want to radically overhaul the system itself,\u201d Faulconer said.\n\nIn his address, the mayor presented a host of proposals. He called for eliminating height restrictions except in the coastal areas, to allow developers to build projects with more units.\n\nAnother proposal would remove parking requirements for properties located near bus and transit routes. Mayor Faulconer also suggested giving developers permission to build bigger projects with unlimited density as long as there are units set aside for homeless or low income housing.\n\nThe head of the industry group that represents San Diego developers said the mayor\u2019s ideas may help ease the shortage, but in a city where the housing deficit is so deep, these measures may not be enough.\n\nBorre Winckel, the president and CEO of the Building Industry Association said excessive state and local regulations have imposed prohibitive costs on developers, making it too expensive to build.\n\n\u201cOur regulations make up nearly one half of the total construction cost of the unit. California, has in essence, destroyed middle income housing by its zeal to regulate and regulate and put in more impact fees, thereby restricting the opportunity to build,\u201d Winckel said.\n\nThe mayor also vowed to increase the number of affordable housing units in San Diego.\n\nKen Sauder, the president and CEO of Wakeland Housing, which has developed dozens of affordable housing projects in Southern California said the biggest obstacle is finding the money to build them.\n\n\u201cIf we really want to tackle the problem in a real big way, we\u2019re going to need to bring in more resources, especially locally,\u201d Sauder said.\n\nThe mayor wants to make it easier for more projects to be green-lighted, without facing roadblocks from local planning groups. Even if housing developments do not need local approval, Sauder said developers will still need to meet with neighbors to help separate facts from fears.\n\n\u201cWhat we would do is we\u2019ll sit down and talk with the neighbors anyway and hear their concerns and try to address them and go from there,\u201d Sauder said.\n\nAccording to estimates from the Building Industry Association, the city needs to build a minimum of 12,000 housing units every year to meet the current demand. At present, San Diego is building less than half of that total.\n\nIf the city doesn\u2019t build more housing, Winckle had this forecast, \u201cUnless we pay attention, we\u2019ll be a city dominated by old folks.It will be a city that will \u2018gray out\u2019, a city that has sent away our young, our productive, our millennials, who on account of high housing costs say, \u2018Adios, San Diego\u2019.\u201d", "title": "San Diego's housing crisis: Mayor promotes system overhaul to build more housing -", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "['housing']", "annot_city": "['San Diego']"}, {"id": 428, "city": "['Dallas']", "url": "https://www.dmagazine.com/frontburner/2018/06/why-dallas-lags-behind-the-new-urban-renaissance/", "text": "This is the second in a two-part series in conjunction with D Magazine\u2019s urbanism special issue that looks at how thinking around urban planning has created the city Dallas is today. The first can be found here.\n\nBy the mid-twentieth century, observers of the rapid changes that were unfolding in American cities began to recognize that the places that were being created did not reflect the ideals promised by the authors of the City Beautiful, Garden City, and Radiant City visions. For all their virtues and flaws, these imaginations of city life were supposed to enrich the quality of life of its inhabitants, allow greater access to nature and leisure, and introduce a higher standard of aesthetic pleasure in urban form. But many 20th century \u201curban renewal\u201d programs only created urban blight, transforming cities that were once full of life into empty, dull, and dangerous places.\n\nOne of the most outspoken critics of \u201curban renewal\u201d was Jane Jacobs, a writer and activist who, after helping defeat a planned highway project that would have demolished her neighborhood in New York\u2019s West Village, published a landmark treatise on city life called The Death and Life of Great American Cities (1961). Drawing on close observations on how life in her neighborhood functioned, Jacobs argued that cities thrived when their communities were home to many uses that were shared by people who sought in them a variety of opportunities and services. Jacobs embraced the messy intermingling of people, places, and economic functions that modern planners had spent a half-century attempting to root-out. Crucially, Jacobs understood that the mid-century deterioration of cities was no accident.\n\n\u201cThere is nothing economically or socially inevitable about either the decay of old cities or the fresh minted decadence of the new unurban urbanization,\u201d Jacobs wrote. \u201cOn the contrary, no other aspect of our economy and society has been more purposefully manipulated for a full quarter of a century to achieve precisely what we are getting. Extraordinary governmental financial incentives have been required to achieve this degree of monotony, sterility, and vulgarity. Decades of preaching, writing, and exhorting by experts have gone into convincing us and our legislators that mush like this must be good for us, as long it comes bedded with grass.\u201d\n\nJacobs was not alone. Other urban observers, such as writer William Whyte and planner Kevin Lynch, began conducting careful observations of day-to-day life in vibrant city neighborhoods and came to many of the same conclusions. But by the time that these critics began sounding the alarm, this new approach to city planning had already been enshrined in many codes, policies, governmental programs, and the attitudes and assumptions of city, regional, and federal planners.\n\nIn the 1970s and 1980s, riots, fires, surmounting crime, deepening segregation, expanding poverty, and general urban dereliction came to define the very loci of supposed \u201curban renewal\u201d projects. Planners and bureaucrats saw this not as a failure of policy, but as its insufficient implementation.\n\nSun Belt cities proved effective at hiding the costs of the success of \u201cunurban urbanization,\u201d and in the 1970s and 1980s, Dallas emerged as a model of the kind of economic success government-subsidized suburban sprawl could generate. However, Dallas\u2019 model of growth created its own problems. While residents migrated into the region\u2019s northern suburbs in pursuit of bigger homes and better educational opportunities, those who remained behind struggled with degrading schools, rising crime, and entrenching poverty.\n\nBy the late 20th century, this pattern of expiration and neglect began to migrate outside of Dallas and into its inner-ring suburbs. The communities that were the first beneficiaries of decentralization were eclipsed by newer and more attractive suburbs.\n\nThe Counterproductive Decentralized City\n\nThis cycle is one of the peculiar, paradoxical characteristics of the decentralized city. On the one hand, the decentralized city seems to treat neighborhoods like the consumer economy treats commodified goods. Neighborhoods have a shelf-life. As they age and their initial appeal fades, they are discarded in favor of a newer \u201cneighborhood-products.\u201d Unlike neighborhoods in centralized cities, which become more desirable as they mature and stabilize over time, in the decentralized city, older neighborhoods are discarded as a kind of urban consumer waste.\n\nDavid Halloran\n\nBut in other ways, the decentralized city doesn\u2019t appear to follow the logic of a consumer market at all. As the tremendous rebound of urban real estate values in walkable cities like New York and San Francisco attest, the kinds of neighborhoods Jacobs, Whyte, Lynch, and others championed are highly desirable to many people. But if there is consumer demand for these kinds of communities, why haven\u2019t developers met that demand by building new urban neighborhoods?\n\nOver the past two decades in Dallas-Fort Worth, some developers have attempted to build more walkable, urban neighborhoods. But too often, developers seeking to build new urban neighborhoods are met with the complicated tangle of codes, policies, and financial regulations developed in the 20th century to support the growth of sprawl. These bureaucratic and political rules and assumptions have been sublimated into the inner-logic and administration of the decentralized city, making the production of a single, monolithic urban form the normative operative procedure of regional governance. Put simply, myriad administrative obstacles make it all but impossible to build good urban neighborhoods in Dallas.\n\nAnd so today we have a situation in which, in the fourth largest metropolitan region in the country, there are hardly any neighborhoods that function like the kind of urban neighborhoods Jacobs and her cohorts championed. In fact, if you have lived in Dallas-Fort Worth your entire life and never left the region, you would have no real frame of reference to understand what kind of environment these writers evoke when they use the word \u201ccity.\u201d\n\nBut most of us know what it feels like to be in these cities because they are the places we seek out in our travels. They are cities in which streets are filled with people; cities that can be explored and discovered by foot; cities that foster interaction, not separation; variation, not monotony; human connection and community, not dissociation and isolation.\n\nAnd it is that disconnect between the cities we seek out and the urban region Dallas-Fort Worth has become that should provoke the greatest consternation among regional leaders. Despite Dallas\u2019 long-held dreams of civic grandeur, the region has evolved into a place defined and entrapped by what architect and urban planner Andr\u00e9s Duany describes as \u201cthe gravity of mediocrity.\u201d\n\nThe Rebirth of the Great 21st Century American City\n\nAfter witnessing the urban devastation of the latter half of the 20th century, architects, planners, politicians, and municipal bureaucrats revisited the writings of Jacobs and the other critics of urban renewal and began to rethink assumptions about what successful urban neighborhoods look like. At the same time, as the century drew to a close, new images of American life began reshaping public opinion, in part through television shows like Seinfeld and Friends. The allure of the suburban utopia was replaced in the popular imagination with idealized feelings of possibility and energy conveyed by images of life in urban neighborhoods. And the cities that still possessed these kinds of older, messier, multi-functional, pedestrian-driven, human scaled places began to thrive again.\n\nBut there was a problem.\n\nTwentieth-century urban renewal had left many cities with few well-functioning urban neighborhoods, and in regions like Dallas-Fort Worth, hardly any at all. A rise in demand, coupled with limited supply, drove the real estate values of attractive urban neighborhoods through the roof. Along with increased financial speculation, the hyper-financialization of the real estate, and other pressures of an increasingly globalized economy, urban neighborhoods in cities like New York and San Francisco became economically unattainable for all but a few. Urban life, once associated with crime, drugs, and dereliction, emerged as synonymous with economic elitism. Gentrification and the economically driven displacement of residents from established neighborhoods proved nearly as disruptive and destructive as urban renewal.\n\nBut just as the suburban sprawl is not a deterministic outcome of the invention of the automobile, gentrification is not a necessary result of the desirability of urban neighborhoods. Rather, it is partly a symptom of a political and economic system that has largely eliminated choice from the neighborhood market. Even though studies have shown that upwards of 60 percent of Americans would like to live in neighborhoods that are walkable, where basic services are accessible without the use of a car, and which foster a greater sense of community, only a small percentage of the built environment in the United States provide this kind of urban experience.\n\nPlanners and developers hoping to reintroduce desirable urban spaces found it easier to accomplish in some cities more than others. The Danish architect and urban designer Jan Gehl helped to radically transform Copenhagen into a hyper desirable bike-and-pedestrian-centric urban playland in a little over a decade by redesigning streets and public ways that supported pedestrian and bicycle use. In New York, projects like the renovation of Bryant Park demonstrated how applying Jacobs\u2019 and Whyte\u2019s principals of scale and dynamic, cross-pollinating human interactions could turn what was once a crime and drug ridden no man\u2019s land into one of the most beloved and well-used parks in the country.\n\nBut too often, planners seeking to return cities to human-oriented scale ran into opposition from entrenched bureaucrats, politicians, and stakeholders alike. The principles of the 20th century urban experiment had become established dogma, and many held tight to a belief that easily accessible free parking, fast-moving highways and streets, segregated commercial and residential districts, and limited density were essential ingredients to urban success. Zoning, building, traffic codes, and other policies restricted the kinds of building forms, densities, and streets designs developers and cities could provide. It became clear that, in order to change urban form, the rules of urban governance would have to be rewritten.\n\nOne such effort came in 1993, when a handful of architects and planners came together to form the Congress for the New Urbanism, which made one of its central prerogatives to draft a new building code that would simply allow cities to create the kinds of urban places people wanted but cities no longer had. The \u201cSmart Code,\u201d as the Congress for the New Urbanism called, was not a set of aesthetic ideals. Instead, it attempted to distill Jacobs\u2019 and Whyte\u2019s observations about how cities functioned into the language of governmental code.\n\nIt emphasized attributes like \u201cwalkability,\u201d defined as having access to shops, restaurants, workplaces, and services within a 10-minute stroll from one\u2019s front door. Neighborhoods were to be connected by a clearly defined hierarchy of narrow streets, boulevards, and alleys, all accented with high-quality pedestrian amenities.\n\nA New Vision for the \u201cMulti-Nodal\u2019 Metropolitan Region\n\nAs Jacobs argued, good streets incorporate a mix of uses and diversity of functions, with blocks that contained shops, offices, apartment, and homes, and districts that included housing suitable for a variety of ages, income levels, cultures, and races.\n\nQuality architecture is important to the success of urban neighborhoods but it shouldn\u2019t be employed to justify the creation of largescale, monolithic superblock developments or uniform, monofunctional districts. Rather, buildings should offer a range of styles and prices, be situated in close proximity to each other, and older structures should be preserved alongside more contemporary forms. Density is vital to allow for walkability and economic vitality, but the planning of neighborhoods, districts, and towns should also carefully consider their overall structure. Highest densities are encouraged toward the center, with the entire district defined by an overall range of densities, ample public space, and discernable edges.\n\nThese principles of urban neighborhoods are not necessarily reserved for urban centers alone. Heavy government subsidization of sprawling super regions has created metropolitan areas that are expensive to maintain, inefficiently distribute economic opportunity, rely exclusively on automotive transportation, and contribute to environmental degradation and pollution. One way to overcome some of these shortcomings is to plan a greater diversity of mixed-density, mixed-use neighborhoods throughout the sprawl of massive super regions\u2014a \u201cmulti-nodal\u201d metropolitan region, a region defined by an interconnected network of dense urban areas.\n\nCity centers like Dallas, as well as many suburban towns and cities, could take advantage of the desirability and enhancing qualities of urban neighborhoods by reconfiguring their layout around clusters of urbanity that sit amid the wider expanse of suburb and exurban communities.\n\nIt is a vision of a region that would develop into a multi-nodal network of urban, suburban, and \u2018edge\u2019 communities, a decentralized city that is not defined and determined by a monolithic sprawl but is home to a multiplicity of smaller urban centers, each of which enhanced by the possibilities of strengthened community, stabilized economic value, and enhanced environmental sustainability. We have already begun to see what these new successful cities will look like: they are the places that reconnect with the fundamental qualities and efficiencies that are intrinsic to dense urban communities.\n\nFor 5,000 years, limitations in transportation and communication retrained the geographical shape and scope of cities. Today, technology has advanced to the point where human societies and economies can transcend most geographical limitations. The railroad and car began this process by accelerating mobility. Continuing advancements in communication networks, automated transport, and mediated and artificial intelligence will only expand the capacity to imagine new forms of urbanized society. In light of this, the urban experiments \u2013 and failures \u2013 of 20th century should provide a warning. The best cities are not designed by prioritizing the possibilities of technology, but rather by responding to human needs.\n\nToday, urban planners and policy shapers who are inspired by Jacobs and her ilk are attempting to accomplish something that has never been attempted in human history: they are trying to shape urban environments that forgo the possibilities of technological potential in favor of focusing on more humanistic design considerations. Here too the urban experiments of the 20th century offer a lesson. The rapid upheaval in the geography of urban space was brought about by a wholesale rearranging of urban polices. The reversal of this system of development could be accomplished by a similar broad-based application of new ideas and principles.", "title": "Why Dallas Lags Behind the New Urban Renaissance", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Dallas']"}, {"id": 429, "city": "['San Jose']", "url": "https://www.mercurynews.com/2019/11/06/in-fight-against-urban-sprawl-san-jose-passes-93-million-deal-to-preserve-coyote-valley/", "text": "In a monumental move to slow down urban sprawl in San Jose, the city council on Wednesday approved a historic $93 million deal to purchase 937 acres in Coyote Valley, a rural expanse of farmland and open space on the south side of the city.\n\nThe council\u2019s unanimous decision \u2014 sealed with celebratory hugs and applause from dozens of residents and environmental activists in council chambers \u2014 culminates more than three decades of development battles over one of Silicon Valley\u2019s most desirable landscapes.\n\n\u201cToday we\u2019ve announced a gift to future generations \u2014 a gift in the preservation of Coyote Valley for their delight and their inspiration,\u201d Mayor Sam Liccardo said.\n\nCoyote Valley has been considered by numerous big tech companies as a prime location for their headquarters over the years, including Apple in the 1980s and Cisco Systems in the 1990s. The land in North Coyote Valley, which is currently zoned for light industrial development, can accommodate 35,000 jobs, according to the city\u2019s general plan.\n\nBut in both cases, environmental groups came out in droves to protest the projects and adamantly argued that the area \u2014 currently used by farmers and wildlife \u2014 should be left in its natural state.\n\nThe undeveloped land, which runs down the western edge of Highway 101 and abuts Bailey Avenue, contains the South Bay\u2019s largest remaining freshwater wetland, offers natural flood protection for the city and forms a key connection that will allow wildlife \u2014 from mountain lions to deer \u2014 to move from the Diablo Range to the Santa Cruz Mountains, scientists say. It\u2019s also home to numerous rare and endangered species, including the jewel flower, bay checkerspot butterfly, red-legged frog, western burrowing owl and tiger salamander.\n\nThe purchase, which is expected to be finalized at the end of the month, will not only protect the land from future development but also provide valuable flood protection for residents so that when Coyote Creek floods, water can fan out over the open area instead of deluging surrounding neighborhoods, as it did in 2017.\n\nWalter Moore, president of the Peninsula Open Space Trust, said the council\u2019s support for protecting the last undeveloped, flat valley in San Jose reflects \u201cmodern, smart growth\u201d.\n\n\u201cSan Jose is putting jobs and housing where today\u2019s workforce wants to be rather than encouraging further sprawl, which leads to traffic, congestion and expensive city infrastructure,\u201d Moore said.\n\nBut at least one resident in the audience Tuesday voiced concern over the potential loss of jobs in the area due to the deal.\n\nKen Saso, a 75-year-old Coyote Valley native, said he supported the land preservation in North Coyote Valley but wants the council to promise to keep the thousands of anticipated jobs in the southern section of the neighborhood.\n\n\u201cBy not allowing development in Coyote Valley, all you\u2019ve done is push people further and further south, forcing them to commute two to three hours a day,\u201d Saso said in an interview after the meeting. \u201cWe need jobs where we are so we can reverse commute the traffic. \u201d\n\nUnder the deal, the city will pay $46 million, and the Peninsula Open Space Trust, a non-profit group based in Palo Alto, will pay $42 million to buy the property from leading Silicon Valley developers Brandenburg Properties and the Sobrato Organization. The Santa Clara Valley Open Space Authority also will contribute $5 million.\n\nThe city\u2019s share for the purchase will be funded by Measure T, a $650 million bond measure approved by San Jose voters last November to upgrade emergency services, pave roads, build bridges and improve flood control. That measure, which was passed by 71 percent of voters, earmarked up to $50 million to preserve Coyote Valley.\n\nWhen the purchase is completed, San Jose will retain ownership of 296 acres, and the remaining land will go to the Santa Clara Valley Open Space Authority, which will be responsible for managing and opening the land to the public.\n\nAndrea MacKenzie, the authority\u2019s general manager, said the council\u2019s vote was just the first step toward realizing the full vision for the land.\n\nThe agency plans to begin offering docent-led tours for the residents in the next month, according to MacKenzie. Although the property currently doesn\u2019t have trails, the tours will be held on the roads on the property, giving the public a chance to see the land up close and also offer their own visions for the site.\n\nOnce the land purchase is completed, the authority will lead a three- to five-year planning effort with public meetings to develop more detailed plans for the land, including trails for both hikers and bikers, areas for sustainable agriculture opportunities, restoration of creeks and wildlife tunnels and corridors under Monterey Highway.\n\n\u201cWe have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to protect and preserve one of the Bay Area\u2019s most significant natural landscapes to benefit nature and people and to be a model for other municipalities and the state to follow using nature-based solutions to build resilience to a changing climate,\u201d MacKenzie said.\n\nCouncilmember Sergio Jimenez, whose concept of open space while growing up in East San Jose was limited to the patio outside of his affordable housing complex, called this purchase \u2018monumental and vital\u2019 for the next generation.\n\n\u201cThis is truly monumental and important,\u201d said Jimenez, who represents the Coyote Valley area. \u201cIt represents another opportunity for kids that maybe can\u2019t afford to go to places like Yosemite to have something nearby that they can visit and appreciate and begin to learn to love nature.\u201d\n\nDespite the region\u2019s growing housing crisis, Liccardo said the preservation of the land played a key in the city\u2019s effort to build affordable housing efficiently and effectively.\n\n\u201cWe got into this mess of traffic congestion and inaccessible housing because we\u2019ve been a sprawling valley for the last half-century,\u201d Liccardo said. \u201cThis is our moment to change that dynamic by protecting our hillsides and open spaces from urban sprawl and focusing housing and development in the downtown core.\u201d", "title": "In fight against urban sprawl, San Jose passes $93 million deal to preserve Coyote Valley", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['San Jose']"}, {"id": 430, "city": "['Austin']", "url": "https://austin.towers.net/central-austin-development-roundup-new-views-and-new-towers/", "text": "Like almost every week, it was a good week for towers in downtown Austin. This time around, we got a look at an all-new development in the Rainey Street District, plus progress updates for a few other projects \u2014 not to mention some extremely fresh new renderings. As they say in the old country, \u201cbada bing, bada boom:\u201d\n\n90 Rainey Street\n\nLocal developer and Urbanspace CEO Kevin Burns brought the Austin Business Journal a scoop yesterday afternoon outlining his plans to develop a 51-story mixed-use tower containing apartments (290 units) and hotel space (293 rooms) on a tract spanning 90-92 Rainey Street \u2014 properties currently home to Container Bar and Bungalow.\n\nAs seen in renderings of the building from architects Nelsen Partners, the project takes the unique step of integrating both of these bars into its design, wrapping around Container Bar and elevating Bungalow to a sort of niche on the second floor. It\u2019s admittedly a little weird, but that\u2019s a thing I\u2019ve heard we\u2019re supposed to keep Austin \u2014 plus, that Bungalow building is historic.\n\nJoining the 44 East Avenue condo tower also planned with 51 floors on the opposite side of this district, it appears these projects \u2014 along with the Travis tower development destined for the former Villas site at 80 Red River Street, alleged to potentially be around 50 stories in height \u2014 are setting the new standard for height in the neighborhood, and we\u2019ll be excited to keep track of them all as they move towards reality.\n\nSpeaking of the neighborhood \u2014 though we\u2019re still getting used to the name, The Quincy apartment and office tower going up right next door to the 90 Rainey Street project is moving along, with fences up and excavation appearing imminent any day now. You can actually see a partially-transparent massing of the Quincy project in the renderings of this new tower:\n\nThere\u2019s one more eyebrow-raising detail from the ABJ story on this project, related to the oft-speculated future of the Waller Park Place site a block away \u2014 emphasis ours:\n\nBurns said he doesn\u2019t expect construction to start until at least 2021. He said he wants his project to deliver near the same time as WeWork\u2019s forthcoming office tower at Red River and East Cesar Chavez streets a stone\u2019s throw away. Burns said WeWork is planning a tower of nearly 1 million square feet, though WeWork hasn\u2019t released any details on its plans yet. \u2014 Austin Business Journal\n\nInsert the googly-eye emoji here \u2014 that\u2019s a lot of square feet, and implies that WeWork might be pursuing a development with similar scale to the massive three-tower complex previously considered for this site.\n\n6 X Guadalupe\n\nThough the timing of its actual construction still remains to be seen, we\u2019ve got some impressively snazzy renderings we haven\u2019t seen before of the 6 X Guadalupe tower from the architects at Gensler Austin. They\u2019re probably the nicest ones yet.\n\nNothing new to report beyond that, except we\u2019d really like to see this thing get moving. Bookings for the Extended Stay America hotel currently atop the future tower\u2019s 600 Guadalupe Street property are still available through at least August, so we might need to keep being patient for a while.\n\nTexas Capitol Complex\n\nThough we\u2019ve already covered the ins and outs of the Texas Facilities Commission\u2019s ongoing project to transform the north side of the Capitol into a pedestrian mall with some shiny new state office buildings and thousands of underground parking spaces also in the mix, some new renderings out of the architects at Page give us an even better look at how this side of downtown will transform:\n\nRiverSouth Financing\n\nWe learned yesterday that Austin developer Stream Realty Partners has secured $122.9 million in construction financing from the New York Life Insurance Company for its upcoming 15-story RiverSouth project in South Austin.\n\nThough the demise of the Hooters at 425 Riverside Drive has experienced a slight delay, we now know that both the wing shop\u2019s demolition and RiverSouth\u2019s official groundbreaking will arrive next week at an event hosted by Stream on Wednesday, March 13.

But a new grant by the Knight Foundation may turn this revitalizing transit corridor into something new: a testing ground for civic technology.\n\nEarlier this month, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation announced a $925,000 investment in The Underline\u2019s technology infrastructure, which would include the hiring of a chief operating officer and chief information officer by the end of the year to help \u201ccreate a technology master plan informed by residents and experts alike.\u201d\n\n\u201cTechnology will be the connective tissue that connects the people, places and activities within The Underline\u2019s 120 acres,\u201d said Meg Daly, founder of Friends of the Underline, the nonprofit that helped champion the idea of the new park. \u201cWe know technology offers infinite ways to improve this space and bring new ideas to life, but we have to build the foundation based on what\u2019s available today and tomorrow.\u201d\n\nAt a time when privacy issues in tech are paramount, and the prospect of a Sidewalk Labs-led smart neighborhood in Toronto is getting blowback, how would a park tech plan work, without raising data security issues?\n\nAccording to Raul Moas, Knight\u2019s Miami Director, the idea is to figure out, with the community, the best ways to apply technology as a layer on top of the new linear park.\n\n\u201cSecurity and safety are, of course, vital, but there are applications and use cases here that can drive better health outcomes,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can use the park and technology as a canvas. Can you use technology to promote certain activities? That\u2019s the question we have, and no other public space is out there right now asking those questions.\u201d\n\nThe Underline seeks to redevelop open space under a span of Metrorail track roughly parallel to the north end of the Miami River. Moas described the projects as \u201ccovering up a scar,\u201d replacing underutilized land with a 70- to 170-foot wide mobility corridor and greenspace.\n\nIn addition to pathways for cycling and pedestrians, the development, when complete, will feature amenities such as a dog park, outdoor gym and basketball court, waterfalls, butterfly gardens, a 50-foot long communal table, and a gaming table for checkers and chess inspired by similar, ad-hoc tables set up in the city\u2019s Little Havana neighborhood. The first section of the park, Brickell Backyard, will open next summer.\n\nSome might wonder, why ruin a new park\u2014ostensibly a place to escape the digital tether of everyday life\u2014with more technology? Does a park need to have an app?\n\nMoas says that\u2019s not the right way to look at it. This project and grant wants to engage with residents to figure out the best way to embed technology to enhance the park experience. It\u2019s not about creating a digital dashboard measuring data. It\u2019s about creating a civic commons that utilizes technology. Moas says that may mean tech that helps with curbside management and mobility, or ways to increase safety. But that\u2019s low hanging fruit, he says, they want to go further. Perhaps there\u2019s potential for a community fitness app, or a way to book and share public events.\n\n\u201cThis funding isn\u2019t meant to buy hardware or software, but to create a design process that brings residents in,\u201d he says. \u201cWe should build this civic commons by, of, and for the public. It should look like the priorities of the community. It\u2019s not tech for the sake of technology.\u201d\n\nWhile the initiative is in its very early stages, including filling the two roles funded by the grant, perhaps it\u2019s best viewed as a promise to create a better process. Tech is ubiquitous today, even in our public spaces, so an effort to make it truly civic tech, designed by residents instead of a tech giant, is worthwhile.\n\n\u201cWe think tech will play a bigger and bigger role,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want to use this as a lab to experiment with tech and tech enablement.

As of 2014, the city has 47 percent tree coverage, among the highest of major cities.\n\nBut Atlanta lacks public green space. Just under 6 percent of the city\u2019s land is parks, and the city ranks 43rd among the nation\u2019s 100 largest cities for its ParkScore, which measures how well cities meet the need for parks, according to the Trust for Public Land.\n\n\u201cDespite the fact that we\u2019re the city in the forest and a very lush, green city, most of that lush greenness is privately held,\u201d says Michael Halicki, executive director of Park Pride, a nonprofit to improve Atlanta parks. He says a third of Atlantans have to walk more than 10 minutes to reach a park.\n\nBut a new pilot hopes to change this with a straightforward idea: Opening schools\u2019 green space to the public outside of school hours. Atlanta Public Schools is the largest land and property owner in the city, so there\u2019s a lot of potential green space to be had.\n\n\u201cOne of the highest costs for creating a park is land acquisition, and so here you have land that\u2019s already owned by the public,\u201d says George Dusenbury, Georgia state director at the Trust for Public Land. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t make sense \u2014 as we continue to get denser and the demand for green space increases \u2014 for land that is held by the public not to be available for more than one use.\u201d\n\nThe Trust for Public Land, Park Pride, the city of Atlanta, Atlanta Public Schools and the Urban Land Institute Atlanta are working together on this pilot to open up schools as neighborhood green space. The public can use the space when schools are closed \u2014 after hours, on weekends and during the summer. But the pilot does more than unlock the gates. Based on ideas from the school communities and surrounding neighborhoods, each schoolyard will get an as-yet-unspecified upgrade.\n\nIn order to locate schools that would have the greatest effect on green space accessibility, the Trust for Public Land mapped out people who could walk to a school but not a park within 10 minutes. It then ranked the schools with the highest numbers of these populations, particularly in lower-income neighborhoods.\n\nEarlier this year, Atlanta Public Schools invited 17 of these institutions to participate in the pilot that will open these schoolyards as after-hours parks. Ten schools expressed interest in being part of the pilot, spanning neighborhoods all around Atlanta.\n\nAtlanta Public Schools extended the invitation to schools across the city \u2014 with a particular focus on low-income areas below Interstate 20 such as southwest Atlanta, says Rachel Sprecher, executive director of partnerships and development for Atlanta Public Schools.\n\n\u201cEverything we do, we look through an equity lens,\u201d she says. \u201cWe like to offer opportunities to all our [schools], but we do have a special lens about maybe the schools in areas that need more resources that don\u2019t usually have the opportunity to seize them.\u201d\n\nThe first three pilot schools will be announced in May. Halicki says the schools will be in different geographic areas and have students from different income levels, since the pilot should be a learning opportunity.\n\nAfter it chooses the three initial schools, Park Pride will further evaluate each site this summer. In the fall, it will hold meetings with the schools, students and surrounding communities about what they want to see in the spaces and how they want to use them.\n\n\u201cThere might be ideas that go beyond our price tag, but that could actually be something that is actually written up and documented that gives people an idea of what the community liked and what they would like to see,\u201d Halicki says.\n\nConstruction will happen in summer 2020, and the first three schoolyards will open that fall. All 10 schools will open to the public within three years.\n\nFor each school that opens to the public, the Trust for Public Land has committed to offering $150,000 of support in order to improve the playlots.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re hoping that with this program and with generous philanthropy and external funding, we can maybe enhance some of the schoolyards, so whether that\u2019s new playgrounds or upgrades or trails or things that maybe our general fund doesn\u2019t cover or at least is not on the docket for renovation,\u201d Sprecher of Atlanta Public Schools says. \u201cWe are hoping that these partners can bring some of those resources that can go towards those enhancements and then that will be more attractive and compelling to get the community to use the parks.\u201d\n\nWhat will be done to improve the parks will depend on community and school input, Sprecher says. But potential projects include an adaptive playground accessible to people with physical disabilities, walking trails, new playgrounds or learning gardens.\n\nPark access is an equity issue, says Sharon Danks, founder and CEO of Green Schoolyards America, a national organization to make schoolyards more natural. Green spaces and parks tend to be in higher-income neighborhoods, so making sure schoolyards are accessible and green can help.\n\nShe says all school districts should do the type of work that the initiative in Atlanta will do.\n\n\u201cIf we can green schoolyards across the city, then we are democratizing access to greenspace,\u201d Danks says.\n\nThe Trust for Public Land has helped convert more than 200 schoolyards around the U.S. to be after-hours parks, including in Oakland, California, where it partners with Green Schoolyards America. If the Atlanta pilot succeeds, Dusenbury wants to replicate it in other Georgia cities. It would likely focus on the four other cities that have joined the organization\u2019s national campaign to place parks within a 10-minute walk: Brookhaven, Clarkston, Decatur and Macon. All but Macon are in metro Atlanta.\n\nOpening schools as green space can affect communities that are park deserts. Halicki says this creates parks for kids who live near a particular school but don\u2019t go there or who don\u2019t have space nearby in the summer.\n\nIt could also strengthen the ties between a community and its school. Halicki says perhaps neighbors will even pitch in to clean those schoolyards because it\u2019s no longer just their local school \u2014 it\u2019s their local park.\n\n\u201cWe spend an awful lot of money on schools, including people who don\u2019t have kids going to those schools,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is a way that they actually wind up both getting some use out of those spaces but also a connection with those different schools as an anchor within their community.\u201d\n\nEDITOR\u2019S NOTE: We\u2019ve clarified where the money for improving the playlots will come from.", "title": "Atlanta\u2019s Schoolyards to Become After-Hours Green Space", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "['green_initiatives']", "annot_city": "['Atlanta']"}, {"id": 436, "city": "['Boston']", "url": "https://www.masslive.com/news/boston/2017/03/how_to_make_boston_more_walkab.html", "text": "North_End,_Boston.jpg\n\nAn aerial view of Boston's North End neighborhood.\n\n(Wikimedia)\n\nFor the better part of the past three decades, Bostonians have forgone getting behind the wheel, opting instead to walk, bike or take public transit.\n\nIn a 77-page report released Tuesday, the city's Transportation Department unveiled plans to improve transportation and housing in Boston with a vision for 2030.\n\nAmong those goals is to see more people lacing up their sneakers and hitting the pavement.\n\nAbout 14.5 percent of people who work in Boston walk to the office currently, far less than the 40.6 percent who drive themselves.

On any given day, they encounter buckled, battered and sometimes closed sidewalks; broken curbs; faded or entirely unpainted crosswalks; and crumbling stairways.\n\nSeattle is one of the richest cities in America. We are in the midst of the biggest boom since the Klondike Gold Rush, with developers pouring money into construction and residents\u2019 property taxes climbing. How have we come to expect and accept so little?\n\nCivic leaders talk about making Seattle a walkable city, but a full-on surge in walking is already upon us, and it's building every year, despite the deplorable conditions. The Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) notes that walking is by percentage Seattle\u2019s fastest growing share of the transportation modes. The number of people walking to work increased by 60 percent from 2009 to 2015. In Columbia City, some 65 percent of people visiting the business district get there by walking. Daily observation on the streets and sidewalks confirm statistics showing rapid growth in walking downtown.\n\nTo accomodate this walking boom, SDOT has written a big Pedestrian Master Plan to replace a largely unconsummated 2009 plan. SDOT advertises its plan, which is under review by the city council, as a 20-year blueprint to make Seattle the nation\u2019s most walkable and accessible city. But help for walkers is not on the way.\n\nThe new plan actually sets the city\u2019s course downward and backward. We'll see more years of inadequate maintenance while what we already have continues to fall apart. There is no vision for investing in areas where a combination of denser housing and job growth will further fuel the walking boom. There are no specific timetables for steps to relieve our epidemic of pedestrians being hit by cars.\n\nThose we employ and elect should be, but are not, charting a path to the kind of city that pedestrians deserve.\n\nHere are some of the ways in which the city's new plan mishandles pedestrian needs:\n\nNeglected.\n\nSeattle's network of sidewalks, marked crosswalks, curbs and curb ramps has a replacement value of $5.5 billion \u2014 more than a billion dollars above the value of all of SDOT\u2019s bridges. But SDOT\u2019s skimpy spending for ordinary maintenance on the existing pedestrian system hovers well under $2 million annually, or less than the department\u2019s estimated cost to build just seven blocks of new sidewalk.\n\nShortchanged maintenance is made even worse by having to fork more and more of the maintenance budget into emergency repairs of a decaying system. The Move Seattle levy allocates only enough money to repair perhaps 6 percent of sidewalks over its nine-year course. According to a 2015 review by SDOT, the city might need 10 times what has been built into the levy just to forestall further deterioration of the existing system.\n\nMove Seattle stipulates just $4 million over nine years for re-marking crosswalks. In 2016, SDOT marked 835 of its 5,500 crosswalks \u2014 the best in nearly a decade. But that was starting from a catch-up backlog of many hundreds, even thousands, of faded and often vanished crosswalks, many at high traffic intersections. And even if the city keeps up last year\u2019s pace, it won\u2019t come close to the four-year remarking cycle promised in the 2015 campaign for Move Seattle levy.\n\nForgotten.\n\nPedestrians\u2019 impression: The system is falling apart beneath their feet. Astonishingly, citizen intuition has been the only measure of exactly how bad the situation has been allowed to get. SDOT has only scanty records, and those a decade old, of any systematic appraisal of actual sidewalk conditions. In its 2015 asset report, SDOT simply demurred that the actual condition of 70 percent of its sidewalks, curb ramps and the like was unknown. That startled even the City Council. So the council last year bestowed $400,000 on SDOT to thoroughly collect block-by-block sidewalk data in 2017.\n\nThe data will become available later this year, too late to inform the 20-year blueprint before the council. Today no one has any idea what it would cost to bring even fractions of the system up to snuff. Shouldn\u2019t the council push the pause button so the plan can be connected to the critical data the council itself requested?\n\nMany areas, even busy routes, simply lack sidewalks. Credit: Douglas MacDonald\n\nMissing.\n\nWhy didn't SDOT focus its new plan chiefly on fixing the sorry current state of affairs? That is because there lurks another problem: the big unhappiness in neighborhoods with no sidewalks. That constitutes a much noisier political issue than crumbling sidewalks. A quarter of Seattle\u2019s blocks have no sidewalks. That\u2019s 1,800 blocks on arterials, many with constant pedestrian use, and 10,000 blocks on non-arterials.\n\nBut here, too, the plan fails us. It touts a priority of filling in a third of the gap, about 3,700 blocks, for a very rough estimated cost of $600 million or more. Compare that to Move Seattle, which proposes to spend $61 million and build 250 new blocks of sidewalks. The notion that they are going to accelerate the construction so rapidly in the 11 years after Move Seattle is absurd.\n\nThe discrepancy isn\u2019t within some margin of rounding error. It\u2019s the utter disconnect between plan and reality. No wonder that SDOT\u2019s plan actually footnotes: \u201cImplementing pedestrian improvements ... in the [plan] will take major funding and many years of construction and will likely extend beyond the Plan\u2019s horizon\u201d of 20 years. In other words, grand blueprints with no expectation of how to pay for the work.\n\nEven in growing areas like South Lake Union, the city isn't committing the resources needed to keep up with the needs. Credit: Doug MacDonald\n\nMisdirected.\n\nWhat about the pedestrian dimensions of Seattle\u2019s exploding growth? Meticulously mapped urban centers (like Downtown and South Lake Union) and two dozen urban villages (like North Beacon Hill and West Seattle Junction), show where the Seattle 2035 comprehensive plan strives to concentrate the city\u2019s new jobs and housing. Over the next 20 years, the city anticipates adding 70,000 new housing units, 59,000 of which will be in these areas.\n\nFor urban centers and urban villages, walkability, accessibility and quality pedestrian infrastructure are supposed to be cornerstones of the city\u2019s growth policy. But neither the mapped outlines of urban centers and urban villages, nor the 16 percent of the city\u2019s land area now proposed for upzoning, made it into the plan\u2019s geographic framework for prioritized pedestrian investment. Should there not be, at a minimum, some kind of data projection of where and by how much Seattle\u2019s pedestrian activity will grow over the next five to 20 years?\n\nSeattle is facing a big bill to comply with federal laws on accessiblity. Credit: Douglas MacDonald\n\nUnlawful.\n\nThe growth outlook is not the only thundering silence in the new plan. It also skips over the city attorneys\u2019s work on settling a federal class action lawsuit over the widespread failures of Seattle\u2019s 27,000 existing curb ramps to meet the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Later this year, the veil will come off. We will learn how many thousands of curb ramps across the city \u2014 over how many years and how many tens, maybe hundreds, of millions of dollars \u2014 are going to have to be corrected so that Seattle will simply be accessible to all its citizens, in accordance with the law.\n\nNo one pretends today that the $30 million proposed spending in the nine-year Move Seattle levy aiming at curb ramps for 750 intersections is going to be nearly enough.\n\nUnsafe.\n\nIn the last five years, about 35 pedestrians have been killed by cars in Seattle, another 200 seriously injured. In Belltown, a pedestrian was run down by a pickup truck and killed in a crosswalk last week. The trends are steady, not declining. Moreover, the risk of being a pedestrian-carnage victim is disproportionately high in Seattle for people over age 55.\n\nBut the plan offers no hierarchy among opportunities that would likely offer the biggest safety dividends, though that might seem to demand special urgency.\n\nThis much is sadly clear: SDOT\u2019s new Pedestrian Master Plan has no serious claim to making Seattle the most walkable, accessible city in the nation. The plan simply reveals, by what it says and does not say, how Seattle\u2019s pedestrians are gripped in deteriorating conditions and unsatisfactory trends.\n\nThe great loss is that it would be hugely worthwhile for Seattle to aim at being a much more decently walkable and accessible city than it is today.\n\nThat, however, requires earnestly engaging reality and the data. It means linking tangible goals directly to the city\u2019s commendable urban center and urban village growth and housing policies. It means making hard choices to seize and advance strategies that will make the greatest positive differences. It means setting out schedules and responsibilities for action. And it means finding a bigger slice of the transportation dollar to make walking safer, more convenient and more useful for everyone trying to get around our city.", "title": "Why Seattle will never be a walkable city", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "['walkability']", "annot_city": "['Seattle']"}, {"id": 438, "city": "['San Francisco']", "url": "https://hoodline.com/2018/08/san-francisco-s-biggest-walk-score-winners-and-losers", "text": "If you live in San Francisco, you\u2019re used to walking \u2014 often uphill.\n\nGiven its dense population and small area, San Francisco is America\u2019s second most walkable city, behind New York City.\n\nAccording to Walk Score, the company that calculates walkability, bikability and transit accessibility across the U.S., 45 of San Francisco\u2019s neighborhoods are \u201cWalker\u2019s Paradises,\u201d which means that daily errands don\u2019t require a vehicle.\n\nBut as the city continues to add new bike lanes, transit routes and sidewalks, other neighborhoods are quickly playing catch-up.\n\nWe checked in with Walk Score to find out which San Francisco neighborhoods showed the biggest gains for walking, biking, and transit accessibility between 2016 and 2017\u2014and which saw a decline.\n\nDoing the Math\n\nBefore we get into which neighborhoods boosted their scores and which slipped, it\u2019s important to understand how Walk Score calculates its ratings. They\u2019re based on walking distance to amenities across seven broad categories \u2014 dining and drinking, groceries, shopping, errands, parks, schools, and culture and entertainment.\n\nEach category is weighted differently, and the company also looks at average walk length and intersection density, to calculate pedestrian-friendliness.\n\nThe maximum number of points (out of 100) are awarded for destinations within about a quarter-mile \u2014 no more than a five-minute walk \u2014 of a particular amenity. Fewer points are awarded for amenities farther away, with zero points given for amenities more than a mile and a half away.\n\nAll of that information is then put through Walk Score\u2019s proprietary algorithms, which in turn spit out a number value. The sum of those values is the Walk Score.\n\nYou can see those elements play out in the real-life scores. With a Walk Score of 99.97, San Francisco\u2019s most walkable neighborhood is Chinatown, which teems with shopping, restaurant and school options. The similarly amenity-filled downtown/Union Square area comes in second, scoring 99.41.\n\nAn important factor to any Walk Score is what Walk Score spokesperson Aleisha Jacobson calls \u201cdepth of choice.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn each category, having more options is better than having fewer,\u201d she said. For example, having two grocery stores is better than having one grocery store, and having five neighborhood restaurants will produce a higher score than three.\n\nUp and Up\n\nWhat causes a neighborhood\u2019s Walk Score to jump? According to Jacobson, it\u2019s a combination of factors.\n\n\u201cThere are definitely neighborhoods that are making bigger jumps because cities are actively working to promote walkability and density,\u201d Jacobson said. \u201cThey\u2019re investing in neighborhood revitalization and planning communities around transit areas.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to which San Francisco neighborhoods grew this year, the results aren\u2019t surprising: three of the top five are in the city\u2019s southeastern quadrant, where major building developments are underway.\n\nHere are the five San Francisco neighborhoods that saw the biggest Walk Score gains from 2016 to 2017:\n\n1. Hunters Point: 55.83 (+ 9.09)\n\n2. Sunnyside: 78.72 (+5.94)\n\n3. Treasure Island: 36.33 (+ 4.57)\n\n4. Dogpatch: 90.60 (+ 3.91)\n\n5. Presidio: 42.47 (+ 3.66)\n\nWalking It Back\n\nOn the flipside, there are neighborhoods that saw a big Walk Score dip. According to Jacobson, this usually isn\u2019t attributable to small factors like one or two businesses closing\u2014although when a school or grocery store closes, that has a larger impact than when, say, a restaurant shutters.\n\n\u201cOne or two businesses isn't going to cause the neighborhood score to drop drastically,\u201d Jacobson said. \u201cIt tends to be a broader trend in a neighborhood as a whole.\u201d\n\nHere are five San Francisco neighborhoods that saw considerable Walk Score drops from 2016 to 2017:\n\n1. Forest Hill: 59.92 (- 3.49)\n\n2. Fairmount: 79.94 (- 3.00)\n\n3. Crocker Amazon: 70.74 (-2.42)\n\n4. Clarendon Heights: 57.82 (- 2.29)\n\n5. Sherwood Forest: 50.99 (- 2.27)\n\nMoving forward\n\nIf your neighborhood saw its score decline, don\u2019t fret. Even though some neighborhoods see a dip in their Walk Scores from one year to the next, Jacobson says that the larger trend across the country is that walkability is on the rise.\n\n\u201cWe have broadly seen walkability increasing in most cities and in most neighborhoods across the country,\u201d Jacobson said. \u201cGenerally, the trend is for areas to become more walkable.\u201d\n\nWant to check out your residence\u2019s Walk Score or see how your neighborhood stacks up to San Francisco\u2019s other enclaves?

From how to improve public transportation in cities, ranking the best car-free neighborhoods across the country, and a friendly competition between NYC, San Francisco, and Los Angeles to determine which has the best public transit, this week is all about how we get around in our favorite cities. All aboard!\n\nThe streets of Detroit were built to accommodate a lot of cars. But as the city goes through another renaissance, the opportunity to better plan for public transportation\u2014one of Detroit\u2019s big weaknesses\u2014should be part of a bigger discussion on where the city is headed. Curbed sat down with Trisha White, Detroit Revitalization Fellow and public transit advocate, who\u2019s spent the last two years car free in Detroit and the previous 16 years car free in Washington D.C. We discussed traversing the city on foot, by bike, bus, and train, and what works and what doesn\u2019t when it comes to public transportation in Detroit.\n\nWhat modes of transit have you used in Detroit?\n\nIn my two years in Detroit, I have used every single manner of public transportation available: DDOT, SMART (both buses), Amtrak, QLINE (streetcar), Uber/Lyft (ride-hailing services), cab, People Mover (elevated rail), MoGo (bike share), and Megabus (intercity bus). But I bike or walk most of the time.\n\nWhich has been the most effective?\n\nSince I live and work in Detroit, I can only speak for Detroit and not the \u2018burbs. If you have deep pockets, of course you can Uber everywhere. It\u2019s effective but it gets expensive. The next most effective has to be DDOT. For all its shortcomings, it\u2019s the only system we have that runs citywide. People Mover and QLINE might run on time but that doesn\u2019t help you if you need to get anywhere in the other 99.9 percent of the city.\n\nWhich has been the least reliable?\n\nSadly, that title also goes to DDOT. It\u2019s getting better but still has a lot of room for improvement. Some days, the transit gods smile on you, the bus shows up, you get a seat and you get to your destination on time. Other days, you wait in freezing rain for 45 minutes, the bus is packed like sardines and you show up wet and late. Stuff happens, but transit shouldn\u2019t be a daily crap shoot.\n\nStuff happens, but transit shouldn\u2019t be a daily crap shoot.\n\nWhat could Detroit learn from other cities?\n\nDon\u2019t worry about trains\u2014that train has left the station. Look to other rust belt cities who have worked with what they have to improve mobility. Look no further than Grand Rapids for a great example of a modern, efficient, and reliable bus system. They have a smart card, they connect to the airport, and they integrate with other modes like vanpools and parking lots. AND it's used by all different kinds of people. If they can do it, so can Detroit. Light rail or BRT (Bus Rapid Transit) would be great but what if it doesn\u2019t happen? We don\u2019t need fancy, we just need reliable. Oh, and pay drivers a decent wage.\n\nWhat have been the major difficulties in using transit in Detroit?\n\nLack of reliability is the killer. The industry standard is 90 percent on time performance but DDOT\u2019s is between 60-70 percent.\n\nBus stops are also hit or miss. Some stops have nice shelters and some are just a sign on the side of the road. For my first 18 months, I waited at a bus stop at Eight Mile and Dequindre that was no more than a bent sign on a pile of garbage just three feet from 60 m.p.h. traffic. In winter, these become dangerous icy mounds of garbage just three feet from 60 m.p.h. traffic. This goes from inconvenient to hazardous for people with disabilities.\n\nWhat do you think of the QLINE so far?\n\nThe QLINE is neat but it doesn\u2019t really function like transit. When I think of public transportation, I think of moving people from home to work, shop, school, play, and then back home. Right now, only a handful of people can do all of those on the Q because we don't have the housing density near the line. Maybe over time that will grow, but for now it's just a fancy shuttle for Tigers games\n\nDo you think residents need a car in Detroit?\n\nI\u2019m sure plenty of people have legit reasons to have a car. You do you. But if you live and work in Detroit, give car-free a try. If 26 percent of Detroiters live without a car, maybe you can too. Park your car for a month and get around on foot, bike, and bus. Use ride-hailing services sparingly but when you need to. While you\u2019re waiting for the bus, do some back-of-the-envelope math on how much money you would save if you sold your car. Then make a list of things you would rather do with that money.\n\nThis subject is bigger in Detroit because the high rate of poverty runs smack into the prohibitively high cost of owning and insuring a car here. What if more Detroiters had reliable transit and could shift their car spending to investing in homeownership, health, education, or savings?\n\nWhat do you think of current bike infrastructure in Detroit?\n\nI'm always wowed by the amount of bike lanes\u2014200 miles\u2014in the Motor City. With the flat terrain, cool weather, and light traffic (compared to other cities), Detroit can be a bike paradise. Everyone should check out the new protected lanes on Cass Avenue. Once we teach people to stop parking in them, it\u2019ll be the Cadillac of bike lanes.\n\nHaving said that, all the bike lanes in the world can't change how people drive. Even in bike lanes, you have to stay alert and keep your head on a swivel. Drivers aren't looking for you so you have to look for them. With car vs. bike accidents, it doesn't matter who had the right of way because the human on the bike is going to lose every time.\n\nThis is true in all cities, but Detroit is going through a weird learning curve with bikes and bike lanes. Drivers may not be familiar with how to share the road and many Detroit riders ride against traffic because they believe it's safer. Sadly, some leaders oppose bike lanes as harbingers of gentrification, only for the spandex crowd.\n\nI'd also love to see more bike racks. I went to the Lions' opener and guards shooed me away from locking my bike on a fence. I spent 40 minutes looking and talked to three managers, none of whom could tell me where to park a bike at Ford Field. So a facility designed for 65,000 people was not designed for even one bike. Weird.\n\nWhat advice would you give someone who's moving to the city without a car or a resident who wants to get by without one?\n\nJane Jacobs called it \u201ceyes on the street\u201d\u2014the more people on the street, the safer they become.\n\nWalk and bike! It\u2019s by far the cheapest and most reliable transportation. You\u2019ll also burn calories and get to know the city much better on the ground. And bonus\u2014you\u2019re making everyone safer by being out and about. Jane Jacobs called it \u201ceyes on the street\u201d\u2014the more people on the street, the safer they become.\n\nAnd just get on the bus. In so many other cities, public transportation is used by people of all ages, abilities and ethnicities, across all socio-economic strata. Everyone. For everything. It\u2019s just how you get around and it\u2019s normal. Here, there\u2019s this ugly stigma and a glaring lack of diversity on DDOT buses. I can count on one hand the number of times I saw another white person on the bus.

Here's why. (Feb. 16, 2017)\n\nThe plan will be unveiled to the public at the Jan. 19 meeting of the Tampa Bay Transportation Management Area Leadership Group (TMA), a group of political and transportation leaders from the three counties. But the planners said they could not discuss the details before next week's public meeting.\n\nHowever, they've already started explaining the plan to public officials. Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn, Tampa City Council member Harry Cohen, and St. Petersburg Mayor Rick Kriseman said they were recently briefed on the 40-mile bus route that has emerged as the lead option from that ongoing regional transit study.\n\n\"This is a real, live proposal,\" Cohen said. \"This is the first time in a long time that we're going to have a real project with a blue print in front of us that we can sink our teeth into.\"\n\nKriseman said he and other political and business leaders would still like one day to see a light rail system take shape. But the reality, he said, is that BRT is more affordable, easier to build and quicker to get up and running.\n\n\"Unless we are willing to ask the public to tax themselves significantly in order to make it happen,\" Kriseman said, \"then realistically light rail is really not going to happen.\"\n\nPREVIOUS COVERAGE: Long-awaited Tampa Bay transit study identifies five corridors for future transportation systems (April 22, 2017)\n\nThe buses are expected to have a dedicated lane for at least a majority of the route, allowing them to bypass regular traffic. And they might not even look like traditional busses, Cohen said, instead favoring smaller or more agile vehicles.\n\n\"I think the idea is to get vehicles that don't look like your standard bus, that have more of a rail feel to them, but the technology is still rubber tire,\" Kriseman said. \"So you're kind of combining the feel of rail with the cost and flexibility of BRT.\"\n\nThat system would ideally be able to accommodate autonomous vehicle technology in the future. However, those details and many others, including the cost to build and maintain such a system, are still being worked out.\n\nBut while the specifics are still unknown, it's becoming more clear that an enhanced bus system, not a rail line, will likely be the first major regional transit project that Tampa Bay leaders pursue.\n\n\"The numbers don't lie,\" Buckhorn said. \"When you look at the cost and the ridership numbers and the likelihood of state and federal matches, I think it made a lot of sense.\"\n\nBuckhorn has long been a proponent of rail, particularly connecting urban areas, but said he wasn't interested in waiting any longer while people continued to debate the merits of a light rail line.\n\nTAMPA BAY TIMES: TRANSPORTATION\n\nCreating one transportation planning agency for all of Tampa Bay won't be easy (May 12, 2017)\n\nGoodbye Tampa Bay Express, hello Tampa Bay Next; but toll lanes aren't going anywhere (May 22, 2017)\n\nDepend on a HART bus to get around?

Rail has also lacked support from local legislators.\n\n\"Candidly, I'm tired of talking about it,\" Buckhorn said. \"We need a victory ... I can say with a great deal of certainty if we move toward a BRT model using the existing interstate, we can get this done much more quickly than another prolonged debate in a political referendum about whether or not rail is appropriate for our area or not.\"\n\nThe Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority has a plan to build a BRT system that would connect downtown St. Petersburg to the beaches, but the 11-mile route depends on federal funds coming through in the next few years.\n\nThe Jan. 19 meeting will see the third significant update in the regional premium transit feasibility plan, a cumbersome term for a process to identify specific transit projects that will best serve the region. It's all part of a 2\u00bd-year study, paid for with $1.5 million from the Florida Department of Transportation and overseen by the Hillsborough Area Regional Transit Authority.\n\nNeither Buckhorn nor Cohen was surprised by the selection of BRT over light rail, but said they suspect some in the community might be. The last update from Jacobs in September listed a light rail line along that corridor as the leading option.\n\n\"I do think there may be people in the public who might be surprised that they didn't land squarely on a light rail project,\" Cohen said. \"They very much think its a good long-term play, as well as something that could be implemented quickly and more affordably than the other options.\"\n\nContact Caitlin Johnston at cjohnston@tampabay.com or (727) 893-8779.

Now, the director of Denver Public Works says the decision could go to voters as early as May or November 2019, if elected leaders approve.\n\nIn the short term, the change could allow the city to better coordinate its efforts on transportation and mobility. It also could lay the groundwork for larger projects and changes.\n\nThe big idea\n\nCurrently, the city\u2019s Department of Public Works handles everything from trash collection to automobile traffic and dockless scooters. The potential new department would take over all the city\u2019s transportation-related duties, and it would be led by a new cabinet-level position, which would create new prominence for transportation issues in the city.\n\nThe change would have to go first through Denver City Council and then be approved in a local election. The decision comes as the city weighs long-term transportation plans that could cost billions.\n\nThe city\u2019s plan for the next 22 years outlines about $1.7 billion worth of potential spending on sidewalks and trails alone. The administration also wants to build up transportation services on major corridors like Colorado Boulevard, whether it\u2019s special bus lanes or new rail lines.\n\nMoving beyond RTD?\n\nRight now, the city relies on the Regional Transportation District for its bus and train service \u2014 but the city\u2019s ambitions may exceed RTD\u2019s budget.\n\nTransit lines in Boulder, Golden and Aurora have all faced reduced service recently; RTD said the cuts were a response to low ridership. And a planned rail line to Boulder has been delayed past 2040. That has prompted some cities in the northwestern metro to consider a lawsuit, and Boulder also has looked at the idea of a new local transit authority.\n\nIn Denver, the creation of a new department would not necessarily come with new money. And the city is unlikely to replace RTD\u2019s core services.\n\nStill, the city has shown some appetite for transit spending, including for bus-rapid transit on Colfax.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the local governments. Everybody in town is looking at how transportation affects the quality of life of people,\u201d said Kate Williams, executive director of the Denver Regional Mobility & Access Council, who is also an RTD board member. \u201cTransportation has come right up to be on the same level of housing.\u201d\n\nDenver could get some new spending power from Proposition 110, a proposed increase to sales taxes that will be on the statewide ballot this November. If it passes, the city stands to collect $846 million over 20 years, according to projections.\n\nWith a new transportation department, Denver also could pay for enhanced RTD services, or to launch its own services, according to a city study.\n\nRTD \u201cseems open\u201d to the idea, the study said, but the district was concerned that Denver could compete against its services.\n\n\u201cBased upon our excellent working relationship with the City of Denver, we do not have any major concerns with the plans we\u2019ve seen and discussed,\u201d wrote RTD spokesperson Scott Reed in an email to the Denver Post.\n\n\u201cWhile it would not make sense for any municipality to duplicate RTD services, supplementing RTD services with increased service and alternative modes is a very logical approach that can maximize everyone\u2019s mobility options and transit investments.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s next?\n\nDPW Director Eulois Cleckley already has reorganized his department, separating out transportation staffers into a new chain of command.\n\nCleckley said at a recent meeting that Denver could ask voters to create a separate city department as early as May.

Yes, the Baltimore Metro has a radio station. But today, and for another few weeks, there is no subway service. On Feb. 11, the Maryland Transit Administration announced it would shut down the city\u2019s only subway line for a month to make emergency track repairs.\n\nHabib Malik, 64, stood on the curb, waiting for one of the free shuttles the MTA has arranged during the repairs.\n\n\u201cGetting back and forth to work is kind of difficult because we don\u2019t know what time to come out here to catch the bus,\u201d he said. He wasn\u2019t even sure where the shuttle would stop.\n\nMalik gave himself an extra hour for a trip that normally takes seven minutes. That morning, Dayshia Bunting, 20, was a half-hour late to her job at Burger King.\n\n\u201cThey were understanding because they know the train is down right now, but I\u2019m missing out on money,\u201d she said.\n\nTransportation headaches are nothing new in Baltimore. Last spring, the city revamped its bus system with new routes designed to be more efficient and reliable.\n\n\u201cWe had the same exact problem, where everybody was confused, they didn\u2019t know what bus to catch, and then they\u2019re raising the prices on top of that,\u201d Bunting said.\n\n\u201cWhat we\u2019re looking at in Baltimore is systematic, gross, underinvestment in the transportation system,\u201d said Samuel Jordan, president of the Baltimore Transit Equity Coalition, an advocacy group.\n\nEven when the Metro is running, research from the Brookings Institution has shown that nearly two out of three jobs in the region can\u2019t be reached by public transportation within 90 minutes. Jordan calls the uncompensated time spent on a bus stuck in traffic or waiting to transfer \u201ctransit detention.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur calculations show that at minimum the economy is losing $325 million a year just in transit detention,\u201d he said. \u201cThe burden is borne always by people of color, low-income and households that don\u2019t have access to cars.\u201d\n\nThe unreliable transit system is costly for workers and businesses, said former restaurant owner Jimmy Rouse.\n\n\u201cI ended up having to fire good employees who wanted to work because they couldn\u2019t get to work on time,\u201d he said.\n\nRouse helped found the advocacy group Transit Choices to push for a better system. He pointed to a 2015 Harvard study on upward mobility in the United States.\n\n\u201cIt showed that the No. 1 obstacle for people rising out of poverty in this country was neither poor education or crime, but poor public transit,\u201d he said.\n\nRouse said the new bus system will work better for Baltimore when the MTA installs GPS tracking and tackles worker absenteeism. When the subway line is working, it\u2019s one of the more reliable ways to get around.\n\nThe agency has added dedicated bus lanes and is working on better enforcement, Maryland Transportation Secretary Pete Rahn said at a meeting with state lawmakers from Baltimore last week. It\u2019s also coordinating service with large employers.\n\n\u201cWe are making record investments in transit right now and we will continue to support those improvements,\u201d Rahn said. \u201cWe\u2019re very much aware that there are many people who depend upon transit as their mode of getting around.\u201d\n\nBut the sudden subway shutdown has left those who rely on it, like Bunting in Northwest Baltimore, feeling neglected.\n\n\u201cThis area doesn\u2019t make a lot of money, so I feel like they tend to leave us out of a lot stuff,\u201d she said. \u201cThey don\u2019t really care.\u201d\n\nA coach pulls up on the other side of a six-lane street.

Today, there are about 500 miles citywide and an additional 200 miles in other parts of the Valley.\n\nCar culture, funding restrictions on cycling infrastructure and the sprawling nature of the Valley have historically created challenges for urban cycling. But as Southern Nevada grows in population and road biking becomes more normalized, the region\u2019s cities and Clark County are adopting more bike-friendly policies and infrastructure, albeit incrementally.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re building it little by little,\u201d said Marco Velotta, a senior management analyst in the City of Las Vegas\u2019 Planning Department.\n\nThe efforts seem to be bringing more cyclists out of the shadows. The number of people carrying bicycles onto Regional Transportation Commission buses has been steadily increasing in the past several years, RTC data shows. In May, the agency counted about 56,000 bicycles on buses, and officials continue to observe \u201cwell-utilized\u201d bike racks around the Las Vegas Strip, said Ron Floth, bicycle and community outreach coordinator for the RTC.\n\nCyclists range from children biking to school (particularly in more residential, higher-income neighborhoods) to millennials to aging baby boomers, Floth said. Some cycle primarily to commute, others for leisure and exercise, and others because bicycles are their primary or most reliable form of transportation.\n\n\u201cPeople [are] riding from transit to their final destination, which is work. We\u2019re seeing quite a bit of that,\u201d Floth said.\n\nWithin the city limits, affluent Summerlin seems to have the largest biking population and the most bike lanes, some of which were created by the Howard Hughes Corporation that owns and manages the master-planned community, according to Velotta. Also-affluent Henderson is similarly known for its high concentration of bike lanes and bike paths.\n\nA major goal in the region now is to make biking as equitable as possible, in part by expanding bike infrastructure into all neighborhoods and communities.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one thing to make sure an area like Summerlin has facilities, and that\u2019s important, but we want to make sure we hit places like Downtown and Wards 1, 3 and 5 in the center of the city,\u201d Velotta said.\n\nChanging the culture\n\nDespite a growth in bike infrastructure and bike riders, cyclists and planners acknowledge that the region has a long way to go to protect cyclists and instill a share-the-road mentality throughout the Valley, especially among drivers.\n\n\u201cWe still need to do more on the encouragement part and the enforcement part,\u201d Velotta said.\n\nCyclist injuries and fatalities at the hands of drivers remain common; four cyclists have been killed so far this year in Clark County, according to the Nevada Office of Traffic Safety.\n\nTo reduce fatalities and collisions, many cyclists would like to see stronger enforcement of a Nevada law requiring drivers to maintain a three-foot distance from cyclists when passing them on the road. Although the three-foot law has been in place for years, drivers who hit cyclists (and therefore have automatically broken the law) still often get off scot-free, said Heather Fisher, president of the Summerlin-based bike shop Las Vegas Cyclery.\n\nMany drivers don\u2019t even know that the law exists, and lax enforcement doesn\u2019t help, Fisher added.\n\n\u201cIt just needs to be promoted through the DMV, through signage, or anywhere we can get the word out,\u201d she said.\n\nFisher has lived and biked in the Valley since 1992 and now lives in Blue Diamond, a more rural and potentially safer enclave for cyclists compared with heavily trafficked areas such as Downtown Las Vegas.\n\nDowntown, for its part, has some of the strongest cycling infrastructure in the area, including highlighted green bike lanes and access to the RTC\u2019s bike center and bike share program. But cyclists often agree that it is still one of the most hostile areas, mostly because of the amount of vehicular traffic it gets.\n\n\u201cWhen you get into some of the more high-traffic areas closer to Downtown, people seem to be less [bike]-friendly. People are in a hurry, and maybe they don\u2019t expect [cyclists] there,\u201d said biker and North Las Vegas resident Mary Margaret Williams.\n\nIt\u2019s a problem no longer unique to Downtown, as population and traffic continue to rise rapidly. Even though there are more cyclists on the road than there were 10 years ago, there are also more drivers, many of whom are more distracted than ever before, said biker Sean Tyrone.\n\n\u201cThere are \u2026 more close calls, more accidents and more deaths, and 99% of them are because of driver inattention,\u201d said Tyrone, who is also chief operating officer of Las Vegas Cyclery.\n\nTyrone used to commute for years from east Las Vegas to Green Valley. That bike route is a lot more problematic today, he said.\n\n\u201cI had a lot of close calls [before], but nothing like what I\u2019ve seen and experienced personally in the last five years,\u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say that growth cannot be accomplished in a way that helps cyclists, Fisher noted. For example, the Southern Nevada Regional Bicycle Coalition is pushing for developers to start including bike lanes whenever they build new housing. The City of Las Vegas\u2019 2050 Master Plan will also include a greater emphasis on multimodal transit, including cycling.\n\nFunding for cycling infrastructure has always been a challenge when it comes to getting more bike lanes onto the streets. The Las Vegas Planning Department\u2019s budget for bicycle infrastructure is still a tiny fraction of the rest of the budget, but it is becoming more of a priority, Velotta said. Other departments\u2014such as Public Works, Parks and Recreation, and Operations and Maintenance\u2014are also beginning to embrace cycling-friendly policies, he said.\n\n\u201cThe fact that we\u2019re including more and more buffer lanes, and that is now kind of the default, it just shows that there\u2019s more of a commitment there to making complete streets possible,\u201d Velotta said.\n\nPouring money into the issue isn\u2019t a guarantee the region will become more bike-friendly, but if the money goes toward installing cycling infrastructure and signs, it can at least help drivers prepare to see cyclists and understand how to interact with them, Williams said. She acknowledged that cyclists must understand how to interact with drivers safely as well, something the RTC has been promoting through bike safety programs and educational workshops.\n\nAs a cyclist, the key to safety is to stay with traffic, utilize hand signals and use a bike light at night, which is required under Nevada law, Floth said. Although biking on sidewalks is permitted in most of Clark County with the exception of North Las Vegas, cyclists are safer when they act like motor vehicles and go with the flow, Floth emphasized.\n\n\u201cOne of the things we talk to cyclists about all the time is to ride predictably,\u201d he added. \u201cThat way, motorists know what they\u2019re going to do.\u201d\n\nIn the coming years, Fisher hopes that the region will recognize not only the health, environmental and recreational benefits of cycling, but also how becoming a cycling city could propel Las Vegas into the future.\n\n\u201cYou go to other cities and there\u2019s bike lanes everywhere and bike paths everywhere,\u201d Fisher said. \u201cThey do that to attract the newer, younger tech-y job market to their cities, and to diversify. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to have to do here.\u201d\n\nPlanners seem to have a similar vision.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve come considerably far over the past decade,\u201d Velotta said. \u201cWe really have seen a physical transformation as a result. But we still have a lot of work to do.\u201d\n\nThis story originally appeared in the Las Vegas Weekly.", "title": "Las Vegas cyclists feel growth \u2014 and growing pains \u2014 as region becomes more bike friendly", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "['bicycle']", "annot_city": "['Las Vegas']"}, {"id": 447, "city": "['Portland']", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/americas/5-reasons-why-portland-s-a-cycle-friendly-city-a7692741.html", "text": "Portland, Oregon, might just be the most bike-friendly city in the United States.

He pitched its safety to skeptics by asking how quickly drivers pick up their phones when they sit down in a vehicle.\n\n\u201cWhen they say it\u2019s boring, that\u2019s a done deal,\u201d Rigaud said.\n\nAs driverless vehicles begin to take hold in pockets worldwide, concerns have grown about their safety. In Arizona, an Uber autonomous vehicle struck and killed a pedestrian, while a Navya bus was involved in a crash in its first day of testing in Las Vegas.\n\nWhile the second crash grabbed headlines, the National Transportation Safety Board investigated and determined the truck driver was at fault, the Washington Post reported.\n\nProponents of autonomous vehicles argue they\u2019re safer than manned vehicles.\n\nThe opening of the shuttle, if proven successful, could be crucial toward reaching goals of the region. Central Florida was deemed an autonomous vehicle proving ground by the U.S Department of Transportation.\n\nOrlando Mayor Buddy Dyer has spoken of eventually getting the technology downtown in its LYMMO circulator buses.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t see that happening in the next year or so, but we\u2019re certainly working toward that,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to embrace technology. We want to be known for that.\u201d\n\nOrange County Mayor Jerry Demings, meanwhile, could see it used to shuttle visitors around International Drive and the Orange County Convention Center.\n\nOver time, Demings said he anticipates the buses will be able to take on more of the region\u2019s transit burden. They\u2019ll grow in size and be able to travel farther and on more advanced routes.\n\nAs he pursues a 1-cent sales tax for transportation on the 2020 ballot, he said he suspects autonomous vehicles will play a role.\n\n\u201cAs fast as we\u2019re growing, with as many tourist visitors as we have in this area, we have to do a better job of efficiently moving people throughout the community,\u201d he said.\n\nIn all, two shuttles will operate from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. Tavistock expects to deploy more shuttles and more routes.\n\nThe existing route connects residents near the Laureate Park Village Center to a popular downtown restaurant district where Bosphorous Turkish Cuisine, Park Pizza & Brewing Co., Boxi Park and Chroma Modern Bar + Kitchen are located.\n\nThe vehicles are air-conditioned and have 10 chairs.

Such long commutes are rarer on the West Coast, though the study suggests that may be changing.\n\nAs sprawling as Los Angeles may be, its share of super-commuters\u2014now about 3.6 percent of the total workforce\u2014is only slightly higher than that of the entire nation (2.9 percent). But commute times are growing quickly for many workers.\n\nBetween 2009 and 2017, the number of LA County residents with commutes longer than 90 minutes increased by nearly 30,000\u2014a 22 percent spike. Those numbers include trips by car or on public transportation. Neighboring Orange County saw a 29 percent bump in super-commuters over the same time period, and in Riverside County, the number of super-commuters rose 31 percent.\n\nApartment List analyst Chris Salviati, who authored the report, tells Curbed that many of those facing long commutes in other counties are likely traveling to-and-from Los Angeles for work.\n\n\u201cBoth Riverside and San Bernardino counties have super-commuting rates that are among the highest in the nation,\u201d he says. \u201cI think the vast majority are probably commuting [to LA] by vehicle.\u201d\n\nIn Riverside, more than 7 percent of workers are now classified as super-commuters. San Bernardino isn\u2019t far behind, with a super-commuter rate just over 6 percent.\n\nSalviati explains that because many of these workers are likely traveling by car, these additional vehicles could worsen traffic congestion, which in turn makes shorter trips take longer.\n\n\u201cInfrastructure plays a big role here,\u201d he says. \u201cAs a Metro area grows, if it doesn\u2019t accommodate that growth with appropriate infrastructure, then traffic compounds and commute times are going to increase even for those living [near] the urban core.\u201d\n\nHigher levels of congestion also make it more difficult to get around efficiently using public transportation. In LA, buses that share lanes with private vehicles make up the bulk of the county\u2019s transit system. When traffic is bad, buses are more likely to show up late, and riders transferring to other lines may miss their connections.\n\nIn a recent analysis of local bus speeds, UCLA lecturer Juan Matute found that vehicles in Metro\u2019s system traveled 12.6 percent slower in 2017 than they did in 1994.\n\nSalviati suggests that some super-commuters in LA County may not be traveling far distances; they could just be transit-riders faced with multiple transfers and the traffic-producing effects of urban sprawl.\n\nIf that\u2019s the case, reducing commute times could be a matter of adding bringing more residents closer to the county\u2019s major job centers.\n\n\u201cI think this really speaks to the need to rethink how we let our metro areas grow,\u201d Salviati says. \u201cWhen an area\u2019s got a strong economy and is adding a lot of jobs, that\u2019s a good thing. But then when you\u2019re not adding enough housing in the right places to keep pace with that demand, that\u2019s when we get into these issues.\u201d", "title": "Number of LA residents dealing with commute times over 90 minutes surges", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "['commute_time', 'transportation']", "annot_city": "['Los Angeles']"}, {"id": 453, "city": "['Chicago']", "url": "https://www.timeout.com/chicago/blog/chicagoans-have-the-worst-work-commute-in-the-country-study-says-041017", "text": "If you live in Chicago, chances are your commute to and from work is probably the worst part of your day.

In June, Mayor Bill Peduto joined an alliance of over 100 cities committing to solar and wind power. The announcement came only hours after President Trump made known he was ending US involvement in the Paris agreement, a 195-nation pledge to fight climate change by dramatically reducing carbon emissions. Trump said he \u201crepresents the citizens of Pittsburgh not Paris.\u201d Mayor Peduto, the same day as Trump\u2019s speech, assured the president that the city \u201cwill follow the guides of the Paris Agreement for our people, our economy and future.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEnvironmentalists and climate scientists are united: we must take climate change seriously and reduce carbon emissions by diminishing our reliance on fossil fuels. But a pattern is emerging in Pittsburgh as it has elsewhere: neighborhoods depressed by one collapse or another renew themselves, then outsiders come and price out locals. Inequality\u2019s many manifestations\u2014housing biases, segregation, gentrification\u2014has forced low-income people into polluted neighborhoods for decades and, even as we reshape our cities to prepare for the new future of energy, are threatening to do it again.\n\nGoing green, staying poor\n\nIn downtown Pittsburgh\u2019s Waterfront building, Larry Schweiger, is among those happy to see the Steel City embracing change. Schweiger is welcoming, deep-voiced and, like a kindly professor, given to tangents about his upbringing in Western Pennsylvania and long career in environmentalism. Schweiger is the CEO of PennFuture, one of dozens of local non-profits helping the city transition away from steel and fossil fuel dominance.\n\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a deficit of jobs in manufacturing and blue collar fields. I really respect people\u2019s frustration over that,\u201d Schweiger says. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean we have to reverse our environmental commitments or that we don\u2019t move forward on them. The biggest job creator in Pennsylvania right now is clean energy.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrump\u2019s pulling the plugs out of everything.\u201d\n\nThe clean energy industries provides 66,000 jobs in Pennsylvania, according to a 2016 report from BW Research. While solar and wind have both shown historic growth recently, according to the report, 80% of Pennsylvanian clean energy jobs are in energy efficiency, updating and restoring the state\u2019s many historic buildings to make them more sustainable. Pushing businesses and homeowners towards energy efficiency and renewables could boost job growth even further, in addition to putting the city on the path toward its 2030 goal of powering all municipal buildings on 100% renewable energy. But Schweiger explains that, top to bottom, the hurdles are numerous.\n\nAnything boosting clean energy over traditional sources contradicts the Trump administration\u2019s coal-revitalization messaging; the GOP budget calls for eliminating the federal energy efficiency program. (\u201cTrump\u2019s pulling the plugs out of everything,\u201d Schweiger muses.) Municipal support is also precarious, he explains, because legislative hurdles surrounding building codes means energy efficiency isn\u2019t mandatory in the city. Businesses may not want to foot the bill for it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWe need to look at it from all angles,\u201d Schweiger says. \u201cThat\u2019s [not] the way so many decisions have been made and they\u2019ve been made poorly. Because we\u2019re not looking at how it impacts our neighbors, how it impacts future gens, how it impacts the world at large. \u201c\n\nBut the problem of saying \u201cwe\u201d\u2014either a larger, global \u201cwe\u201d or the policy community Schweiger refers to\u2014need to do something is that not everyone can. Because the final burden, the one for most residents, is the simplest: money. In most cases, residents need to own their home before doing invasive work like re-figuring insulation or having panels installed, if they can even afford it. And in a city still recovering from the fallout of steel\u2019s decline, those who would benefit the most from energy efficiency and cheaper energy bills from solar can\u2019t afford it. Even in an energy transition, being poor is still expensive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA 2016 report from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy found that low income Americans typically spend more of their annual income on energy bills than higher earning households. This only becomes more pronounced if the household is predominantly Black/Latino or if the house itself is rented instead of owned. In Pittsburgh, half of low-income households spend twice as much of their income on energy bills as higher earning households.\n\nSighing, Schweiger recalls one woman in such a home, poorly insulated, sweltering in hundred degree heat, plugging her AC into extension cords overnight.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt overheated, caught fire and she lost two children in the house as it burned to the ground... It really brought it home for me,\u201d he says. \u201cHere\u2019s a person that\u2019s trying to keep her home cool in an overheated world. And she doesn\u2019t have the resources to make that house less expensive to operate. I think those are the kinds of problems we\u2019re gonna see more of down the road if we don\u2019t address these equity issues.\u201d\n\nTransitioning to renewable energy has clear potential to reduce pollution and even save lives, but what does it matter when those who need it the most can\u2019t afford it?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGreenification, gentrification\n\n20 minutes away, Millvale is the city\u2019s most public clean energy success story. A series of floods nearly ruined the former mill town, first in 2004 following Hurricane Ivan and twice following heavy rains in 2007. Already struggling with high unemployment and, despite requests, little financial support from officials in Pittsburgh, local residents rebuilt the area. With a series of grants from sustainability foundations, they converted an abandoned electronics repair shop into the local library, now equipped with solar panels and a fully functional garden. Restaurants and coffee shops sprung up, sourced from food grown just around the corner and staffed by Millvale residents. Now, the borough receives regular national acclaim from city planners, clean energy companies, universities and sustainability orgs.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s a feel good story and one that Millvale\u2019s sustainability coordinator, Zaheen Hussain, repeats often. By building a new sustainability system that harnesses the excitement for clean energy, but centers on equity, locals remained in control as it bounced back from the floods. Born in Bangladesh before immigrating to the US as a child, Hussain is a spokesperson both for Millvale proper and the need for a \u201cfair\u201d clean energy transition.\n\n\u201cAnother tour?\u201d a local smirked as we pass a local diner.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a place where you can be young and make a mark,\u201d Hussain explains. \u201cIn my field, if I were to try and go work [in Boston or New York], I\u2019d get plugged into a system that was built ahead of my time.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMillvale\u2019s development followed the highly regarded Ecodistrict Pivot Plan. The plan sets dozens of guidelines, from setting caps on housing prices to ranking prospective businesses on sustainability and prospects for hiring locally, and building community land trusts, which prioritizes building new communal spaces, like a garden to ease the stressors of being a food desert or a community center for job training.\n\nKey to Millvale\u2019s success, Hussain says, is making equity a pillar of its Ecodistrict plan. The borough\u2019s rising profile has attracted multiple moneyed sustainability stakeholders. But without what Hussain called a \u201cshared vocabulary,\u201d residents aren\u2019t on equal footing with the would be developers trying to transform their community. As a dark mirror to Millvale\u2019s efforts, in nearby Lawrenceville, similar green-centered efforts are instead uprooting longtime residents.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cLawrenceville is like Pittsburgh\u2019s Williamsburg,\u201d he begins. \u201c10, 15 years ago, you\u2019re walking down the street, you\u2019re seeing active drug deals. Today, the housing market\u2014some houses are probably worth 500 times what they were back then. I\u2019m not even joking. Really great for the economy of the town. Also, pushed out a lot of people.\u201d\n\nAccording to statistics taken from the Allegheny County Department of Human Services, there were 1,502 arrests in Lawrenceville in 2005 and only 502 arrests in 2015. Crime is largely a function of poverty. And while it\u2019s decrease is remarkable, the city hasn\u2019t eased stressors on the poor, but displaced them. A local report on the neighborhood\u2019s growth says it now \u201chas almost nothing left that\u2019s affordable for the middle class, either to rent or buy.\u201d In the same report, the city\u2019s real estate and planning manager said nearly one-third of residential properties since 2012 have been bought by outside companies, not Lawrenceville citizens.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs locals complained, Pittsburgh\u2019s overall affordable housing and world-class technical breakthroughs from Carnegie Mellon and U Pittsburgh drew the attention of tech magnates like Google, focusing on machine learning and engineering, Uber, testing out driving-cars on local roads and Amazon, all with offices in the area. As was the case in Detroit, New Orleans, Brooklyn, etc., with this nascent tech boom came new developers pushing a version of sustainable neighborhood transformation that rose rents and pushed out longtime residents.\n\n\u201cPeople sometimes come over here and see what\u2019s happening [and say] \u2018Oh, Millvale. It\u2019s the next Lawrenceville.\u2019 And it\u2019s like curse words. People in town do not want to hear that. That is not what we want.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe dynamics between gentrification, displacement and sustainability are subtle and shifting, but in an industrial city like Pittsburgh, which the American Lung Association ranked among the nation\u2019s worst in air quality, neighborhoods making strides in air or water quality are pushing low income people out of their own neighborhoods and nearer to highways crossing the city, where diesel trucks spew black carbon and near industrial plants where housing is cheapest.\n\nPittsburgh, 1947, Jones and Laughlin Steel Corp. plant. (Photo: AP/Walter Stein)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA 1983 report from the Government Accounting Office found that minorities were more likely to live near pollutants like landfills. So did a 1987 report. And a 2007 report. And one last year. An inequitable clean energy transition is not only oxymoronic, it defeats its own purpose and functions the same as any form of inequality. If the clean energy transition isn\u2019t fair or equitable, if it actually forces poor people into areas with worse environmental quality, then what really transitioned?\n\nRural problems\n\nSharing an office with Hussain in Millville, a former social hall called the Moose Lodge turned sustainability headquarters, Dr. Kirk Jalbert is a data visualization expert with FracTracker Alliance, a research group tracking fracking and pipeline development. Jalbert spent years studying citizen science and environmental justice movements, particularly around water monitoring in rural areas. Having seen both the power of grassroots environmental campaigns and the skepticism they draw from institutionalized scientists, he sees the power imbalances within well-intentioned environmental spaces. The rural people who make up most of the state get left behind.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIf we were to do a wholesale shift to renewables, how does that disrupt areas that are already very poor and already impacted by fossil fuel industries?\u201d he asks. \u201cIf a coal mine shuts down, then people are impacted. And then, does that exacerbate crime issues? Does that exacerbate drug issues? Does that exacerbate domestic violence issues?\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we were to do a wholesale shift to renewables, how does that disrupt areas that are already very poor and already impacted by fossil fuel industries?\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn much of rural western Pennsylvania, coal mining communities are what Jalbert calls \u201cmono-economies.\u201d Coal jobs are the only jobs. Shifting to renewables without a plan for what will happen to people in these economies could be disastrous. Retraining them for clean energy jobs, should they choose them, is expensive and would likely require relocating. But coal mining is a largely generational occupation: most miner\u2019s fathers were miners. That would mean families are essentially forced to leave communities they\u2019ve been in for decades, yet another green-powered displacement. But because coal country backed Trump overwhelmingly in the election and generally support the GOP narrative that Obama-era regulations killed steel and coal, their pushback to a hasty transition out of coal is read as regressive climate denial. It\u2019s complicated.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not being forward thinking about how do we also alter our social and political relationships as we think about economic transitions away from industries we thought were injustice-making,\u201d he says. \u201cThese are just as injustice-making.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTransitioning off fossil fuels will always be a collective effort, but Millvale\u2019s success came from demanding equal footing with new stakeholders. Resolving the imbalances embedded into the fossil fuel system is paramount to a genuine transition. There are no easy solutions, neither energy nor home ownership have ever been equitable in this country. But, a neighborhood under transition should educate and encourage neighborhood education, demand communities well as commercial investment, and think longterm about affordability and efficiency.\n\nAn inequitable transition shifts alternate power sources\u2014wind and the sun for coal or gas\u2014but maintain the imbalances that trap people in cycles of unemployment, environmental harm and a lower quality of life. It hurts both the rural and urban poor. While Jalbert supports championing renewables in the city, he thinks the transition isn\u2019t extensive enough to reverse damaging social inequities embedded in the fossil-fuel based economy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just a matter of shifting the needle a bit left or a little bit to the right,\u201d he says, \u201cwe need to completely rethink our institutions [if] we want to actually take these issues seriously.\u201d\n\nOtherwise, the transition to reduce carbon emissions will accelerate inequality.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis article was made with funding from Participant Media, the creator of \u201cAn Inconvenient Sequel: Truth to Power.\u201d", "title": "Pittsburgh Is Going Green, But Who Is Getting Left Behind?", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Pittsburgh']"}, {"id": 458, "city": "[]", "url": "https://observer.com/2018/02/los-angeles-atlanta-miami-and-san-francisco-are-running-out-of-water/", "text": "Capetown, South Africa, is running out of water. Sometime in April, it will face \u201cDay Zero,\u201d which means that the city\u2019s taps will be turned off and its four million residents will have no access to water. Civil unrest, riots or worse aren\u2019t just a possibility\u2014they are inevitable unless there is a very quick fix.\n\nThe country is rushing the construction of water treatment plants and of desalination plants to harvest drinkable water from the ocean, but these solutions should have been implemented years\u2014even decades\u2014ago.\n\nOther Cities Are Drying Up\n\nCapetown isn\u2019t alone in racing toward an uncertain fate. All across the world, major cities are seeing their water resources shrink at an alarming rate. Tokyo, London, Cairo, Sao Paulo, Beijing and Mexico City are facing the prospect of an arid future. Each is from a different climate and on a different continent, but they all may share the same fate.\n\nCairo has been plagued by desertification and instability in irrigation, but now it has to do so with more mouths to feed and water. Sao Paulo gets even more rain than the U.S. Pacific Northwest, but the water isn\u2019t drinkable, thanks to pollution. Beijing can no longer sustain its water supply as glaciers in Tibet are receding even faster than expected. Mexico City was once built on a lake, but there\u2019s no place for the water to go thanks to construction on water recharge zones. Such activity also makes the area unstable and worsens the destruction from deadly earthquakes. Despite all of its rain, London\u2019s problems stem from a growing population. Tokyo gets as much rain as Seattle, but a lot of it comes during the brief monsoon period, and a weaker rainy season due to climate change could leave the Japanese city high and dry.\n\nWhich Cities in America Could Face a Similar Fate\n\nThese water problems are not just struggles experienced by non-Americans in a distant land. They are concerns that U.S. citizens will face here at home, with just as much intensity as South Africans, Egyptians, Brazilians, Japanese or English. It will be Texans, Floridians, Georgians, Californians and residents of Utah who will face a dry future without immediate action.\n\n5) Texas Cities: El Paso, San Antonio and Houston\n\nSix years ago, I stood in the Rio Grande, on the border of Texas and New Mexico, just outside of El Paso. It was completely dry, but leftover bones of a few fresh water creatures eerily indicated there had been a river. It was nothing like the river I had grown up with in the 1970s and 1980s that formed the famous border between the U.S. and Mexico.\n\nRoughly 100 years ago, a congressionally approved project known as the Elephant Butte Reservoir was completed in Southern New Mexico that allowed water to be diverted from the Rio Grande for agriculture. In the 1930s, Colorado, New Mexico and Texas worked out a deal, with Congress\u2019 blessing, to share the water. But with the Rio Grande running dry, Texas recently sued New Mexico, claiming that the state is violating the deal by draining additional water before it ever gets to El Paso. Oral arguments were heard by the U.S. Supreme Court last month on this subject. Meanwhile, the Rio Grande isn\u2019t so grand, thanks to such water diversions.\n\nTwo other large Texas towns are in trouble. San Antonio has relied upon the Edwards Aquifer, but the growth in population and a lack of recharge could use up this valuable resource. And sure Hurricane Harvey flooded Houston, but that\u2019s not drinkable water, thanks to the region\u2019s dependence on petrochemicals and related industries. Even though Houston was built on a swamp, overpopulation and building on watershed areas could make this city another dry and dusty Texas town.\n\n4) Salt Lake City\n\nThe capital of Utah is fast becoming a victim of climate change. As NOAA\u2019s Cooperative Institute for Research in the Environmental Sciences put it, \u201cFor every degree Fahrenheit of warming in the SLC region, a 1.8 to 6.5 percent drop in annual water flow of local streams could occur.\u201d And for a Western city dependent upon cool temperatures to generate snow and fresh water, those elevated temperatures are bad news.\n\n3) Atlanta\n\nTen years ago, Georgia faced a crippling drought. West Point Lake was nearly classified as a \u201cdead pool.\u201d Many Atlanta lakes nearly suffered the same fate. The rains eventually came, but the city has never fully recovered from those days, though Mayor Shirley Franklin helped the city upgrade its sewage system. Its water supply is tied up in courts, as the result of a water dispute between Georgia, Alabama and Florida. A bad decision in the courts could make this Southeastern city resemble the Atlantis of old.\n\n2) California Cities: Los Angeles and San Francisco\n\nCalifornia is facing its worst drought in recorded history. Los Angeles is struggling with the the depletion of the Colorado River by several states for agricultural purposes. San Francisco is dealing with historically low rainfalls. But overall, the state\u2019s population boom is creating a crisis for the state. But the main problem both cities face is that California is too reliant upon weather to provide water, and there too many water districts to create a coherent policy.\n\n1) Miami\n\nYou would think a city by the coast like Miami would be flush with water, but saltwater can\u2019t be consumed. Moreover, those rising sea levels are seeping into the city\u2019s aquifer. As the waves lap over city streets, the city\u2019s freshwater supply could disappear as fast as a hurricane headed to Florida.\n\nWhich U.S. Cities Are Solving Their Water Crisis\n\nThe news is not all bad. A number of U.S. cities had the foresight to realize that unlimited supplies of water do not exist and that America\u2019s population is growing rapidly. These cities can provide lessons for those municipalities that are struggling to provide enough water for their citizens.\n\nThe city that has done the best is right in the middle of the desert. Years ago, Las Vegas instituted a rigorous water conservation system that\u2019s becoming a model for other U.S. urban areas. Dallas and Austin have engaged in similar ways of preserving water that other Texas cities like El Paso, Houston and San Antonio need to follow. And Boston and New York City haven\u2019t waited for problems to emerge before taking action.\n\nWater is like an economic entity in that there is supply and demand. But unless problems are addressed with both, people will pay a heavy price for inaction. Whether it is boosting supply by utilizing creative technologies and protecting wetlands and watersheds or reducing demand by engaging in conservation methods, all need to be employed to avoid a \u201cDay Zero\u201d like Capetown might soon experience.", "title": "These American Cities Are Running Out of Water", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "['not_sure']", "annot_city": "[]"}, {"id": 459, "city": "['Cincinnati']", "url": "https://www.wcpo.com/news/insider/why-no-large-scale-recycling-of-food-waste-in-cincinnati", "text": "CINCINNATI -- It's enough to make you think twice before you put those moldy strawberries in your garbage can.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, more than 38 million tons of food waste were created in the United States in 2014, with only 5 percent of it diverted from landfills or incinerators. More food reaches them than any single material in everyday trash -- food comprises about 22 percent of discarded municipal waste.\n\nWith so much benefit to be gained from diverting organic waste from landfills, local environmentalists are looking at ways to make that happen in Cincinnati.\n\nPerhaps the Queen City could learn something from Seattle, Washington.\n\nEat in the food court of the popular Seattle Center Armory there, right next to the Space Needle, and you'll find three bins to fill when you're done eating: one for your trash, one for your recyclables and one for your food scraps.\n\nA few years ago, the city banned putting food scraps in garbage, said Susan Fife-Ferris, the director of solid waste planning and program management for Seattle Public Utilities.\n\nTable scraps and other organics like yard waste are trucked to two composting facilities, where private contractors process them into compost they sell as a soil supplement.\n\nThe city generates about 97,000 tons of organics every year, Fife-Ferris said. That's 97,000 tons of waste it doesn't have to compact and haul to Oregon for disposal in a landfill, which she said makes for substantial savings.\n\nWhy doesn't Cincinnati have a similar program for handling food scraps?\n\nThe simple answer is that there's nowhere to process them.\n\n\"If you're not willing to invest in some kind of facility, it's hard to get an organics program going,\" Fife-Ferris said.\n\nOne reason why Cincinnati doesn't have a processing facility is because of its recent history with Compost Cincy, said Kristin Weiss, executive director of Green Umbrella, a nonprofit that works to create a more sustainable region.\n\nEnvironmental advocates had high hopes for Compost Cincy, a business that in August 2012 opened a commercial food waste composting facility in Winton Hills.\n\nBut within a few months of its opening, residents began complaining of odor, birds, insects and other vermin. The city of Cincinnati closed the operation in February 2014 and recently agreed on a plan for its cleanup with the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.\n\nThat costly experience convinced city officials that composting should be done indoors, preferably in an anaerobic digester that would produce both compost and natural gas. Discussions are ongoing about building such a digester, but city officials have said it's not likely the city would be an active partner in building one.\n\nAlong with the Greater Cincinnati Green Business Council, Green Umbrella is facilitating those discussions, Weiss said. There's no reason the city can't learn from its experience with Compost Cincy and have well-operating facilities, she added.\n\nIdeally, such a facility would be located within 20 minutes of downtown to minimize the environmental impact of trucking materials long distances, she said. The problem is, given the city's experience with Compost Cincy, few residents would be willing to have one located in their backyard.\n\nLocal laws and regulations can also inhibit efforts to compost food scraps. For example, in Cincinnati there are zoning restrictions that prohibit moving food waste from one site to another for composting, said Michaela Oldfield, director of Green Umbrella's Food Policy Council.\n\nHer group is looking at ways the city can adjust its ordinances to encourage neighbors who share community gardens to do collective composting.\n\nGrowing interest in salvaging food\n\nAlthough no one wants to have a large-scale composting operation like Cincy Compost in their backyard, there seems to be a good deal of interest in backyard composting.\n\nEvery spring, the Hamilton County Recycling and Solid Waste District offers a half-dozen seminars on backyard composting that always sell out, said spokeswoman Joy Landry. The smallest venue attracts about 40 people and the largest draws 80 to 90, she said.\n\nA free brochure on how to do backyard composting is available here.\n\nMeanwhile, local environmentalists are looking at ways other than composting to deal with surplus food.\n\n\"Our focus is really on how we can educate people and businesses to start addressing food waste, and prevent it from happening in the first place,\" Lauren Campbell, a member of Green Umbrella's Waste Reduction Team, said.\n\nHer team is working on a plan on how to best get that word out. One tactic is to talk with restaurateurs about how they can reuse food or send unused food to a local food bank such as FreeStore Foodbank. It accepts donations of food from canned food drives, government agencies, wholesalers, retailers and produce farmers.\n\nAnother option is the restaurant-turned-nonprofit La Soupe, which uses grocery store produce from Kroger, Jungle Jim's and local organic farms that would otherwise be tossed out to make soup for hungry people.\n\nLast fall, the Hamilton County Solid Waste District ran a Facebook campaign to spread the word about how to make food last longer in the refrigerator, Landry said. The campaign used free ads supplied by Save the Food, a project of the Ad Council and the Natural Resources Defense Council.\n\nAt Amity Elementary School in Deer Park, a food sharing table has been set up where students can put foods they don't want for other students to eat, Landry said. Whatever's not eaten at the end of the lunch period is collected by a volunteer cafeteria worker and taken to a local food pantry.\n\nOn average, the food rescue program, which began during the 2014-15 school year, rescues 27 food items a day from the landfill. Those interested in setting up a food rescue program of their own may contact Cher Mohring, program specialist at the solid waste district, at 513-946-7737.\n\nIt's an idea that's catching on nationwide -- and that has the endorsement of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\n\nThe government mandates that children be served a certain amount of fruits and vegetables, but children don't always eat them, Oldfield said.\n\n\"If the food is unopened and properly controlled, there's no reason it should go in the garbage,\" she added.", "title": "Why no large-scale recycling of food waste in Cincinnati?", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "['recycle']", "annot_city": "['Cincinnati']"}, {"id": 460, "city": "['Kansas City']", "url": "https://www.kshb.com/news/local-news/city-considering-short-term-solution-for-northland-trash-problem", "text": "KANSAS CITY, Mo. \u2014 After receiving thousands of complaints about trash and recycling services in the Northland, city leaders met Tuesday to discuss both long and short-term solutions.\n\n\"It's something that you should be able to rely on as happening everyday at the same time when it's supposed to happen.

In San Francisco, the top recycling city, 80 percent of the trash is reused. In Seattle, almost all residents participate in the program, reusing nearly 60 percent of the waste. The national average is 35 percent.\n\nAnd in Indianapolis? Only 7 percent is recycled.\n\nIndyStar gathered and analyzed recycling rates \u2014 the percentage of waste that is kept from the landfill or incinerator \u2014 for the 50 most populous cities in the country. Urban areas from New York City to Houston, Portland to Milwaukee and Phoenix to Columbus typically recycle as much as 20 or 30 percent of their waste, and some much more.\n\nIndy \u2014 the nation's 14th largest city \u2014 is the biggest municipality without a curbside recycling program serving every household. And only two of the top 50 cities \u2014 Detroit and New Orleans \u2014 recycle slightly less than Indianapolis.\n\nUnlike Indianapolis, however, those cities are notorious for their financial struggles.

And lurking behind that decision is politicians' reluctance to pay for a robust system, and their long commitment to burning a huge portion of the city's trash that could be recycled.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely, Indianapolis is behind,\u201d said Ron Gonen, co-founder and CEO of the Closed Loop Fund, a national organization that funds efforts to build and expand recycling infrastructure. \u201cIf I was an Indy resident, I would be scratching my head and asking the city: 'What are we missing in Indy? Why aren\u2019t we able to take advantage of this?'\u201d\n\nAnd, in fact, many are.\n\nNewcomers are often caught off guard. David Johnson moved here nearly two years ago from Seattle, where recycling is a way of life \u2014 if not a \u201chobby,\u201d as he describes it. He was disappointed to find out recycling was \"like a foreign language\" in Indianapolis.\n\n\u201cIt implies the city is not vibrant, behind the times, and not a leader in conservation or clean environment efforts,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nLongtime residents also say they want universal recycling. City officials say they receive weekly phone calls and emails from people asking about recycling. Responding to a 2016 survey by the city's Office of Sustainability, 91 percent of residents asked agreed that recycling is important.\n\nRecycling is no longer considered an amenity for the best cities, said Allyson Mitchell, executive director of the Indiana Recycling Coalition. It\u2019s an expectation. Any city without it is at a disadvantage when trying to attract progressive companies.\n\nMayor Joe Hogsett\u2019s administration has now promised to expand the program.\n\n\"We have an unsustainable model for trash disposal that is the legacy system that has grown up over time,\" Indianapolis Deputy Mayor Jeff Bennett said. \"The future of solid waste has to change, so we are looking at how do you include universal curbside recycling in that future.\"\n\nBut, for decades, mayor after mayor in Indianapolis \u2014 Republican and Democrat \u2014 has made similar promises that went nowhere. Residents and advocates wonder if this time will be different.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a sad, sad story in Indianapolis,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cIt\u2019s a saga.\u201d\n\nPenalized for recycling\n\nThe city\u2019s recycling problems date back to decisions made more than 40 years ago, when a country enormously dependent on fossil fuels was hit by rising oil prices and diminishing landfill space.\n\nAs early as 1975, city officials created a task force to find ways to reduce the amount of trash going into landfills because the city was \"running out of options,\" according to Dave Arland, who was press secretary to former Mayor William Hudnut. By 1981, they landed on the idea of building an incinerator to create energy, a path they would doggedly stick to over the next 38 years.\n\nWhat was then Ogden Martin Systems came to town in 1985 and struck up a deal with the city to build and operate an incinerator. The city issued $109 million in bonds to finance the project, which Ogden was on the hook to pay \u2014 so the city needed Ogden to succeed. In 1988 the incinerator on Harding Street on the southwest side burned its first load of trash.\n\nIt was billed as a form of recycling. And indeed it put trash to use. The city bought steam energy produced by the incinerator to heat and cool its downtown buildings.\n\nStrictly speaking, however, it was not a recycling program. The plastics, paper, aluminum and other materials heaped into the incinerator were reused only once. A curbside recycling program not only reduces the need for landfill space, but also reuses the materials again and again.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, an incinerator is not as clean. Five months after its launch, the incinerator violated its air quality permit for the first time. And it has done so repeatedly: In its first few years of operating, the incinerator exceeded its pollution limits as many as six to 10 times a month. The facility violated its permit as recently as 2018 when equipment malfunctions caused it to spew too much carbon monoxide into the air.\n\nEven when it operates within federal limits, the incinerator produces more greenhouse gases than recycling does. And the ash and other detritus the incinerator generates are still sent to the landfill.\n\nMany cities were already abandoning their incinerator plans or closing their facilities by the mid-1990s. Instead, cities from coast-to-coast and throughout Indiana were launching curbside recycling.\n\nIndianapolis officials, however, showed only a faint interest in joining what was swiftly becoming standard operating procedure. Officials at the New Jersey-based company now called Covanta insisted that the incinerator did not create a disincentive for curbside recycling \u2014 a position they maintain today.\n\n\u201cIn the vast majority of the communities where we operate, curbside has been very successful,\u201d company spokesman James Regan told IndyStar. \u201cWe have always been supportive of increasing recycling in the city \u2026 and we remain supportive.\u201d Arland agreed, and emphasized that incineration and recycling are not mutually exclusive.\n\nBut, in practice, the contract with Covanta created hurdles.\n\nAs part of the contract, Indianapolis received a break on the steam energy costs based on how much trash it sent to the incinerator \u2014 if it sent less, it paid more for energy.\n\nThe incinerator had such a hunger for fuel that the city passed an ordinance that forbade trash haulers operating in the city from disposing of their refuse anywhere else because the facility \"needed a guaranteed method of revenue,\" Arland told IndyStar. Such ordinances were later struck down as unconstitutional for discriminating against interstate and international trade.\n\nStill, it made clear how adamant the city was about burning as much trash as possible.\n\nAnother contract clause also encouraged incineration. It required the city to deliver more than 300,000 tons of waste per year to the incinerator, or pay a penalty.\n\nAgain and again, the wisdom of that penalty was debated as mayor after mayor promised to expand recycling. Yet the penalty created by Mayor William Hudnut was sustained through the administrations of Steve Goldsmith, Bart Peterson and Greg Ballard.\n\n\u201cIt is inexplicable to me that over the course of many administrations that the contract was renewed again and again, and someone didn\u2019t say we need to take this out of there,\u201d said state Rep. Carey Hamilton, who now represents Marion County but previously led the Indiana Recycling Coalition.\n\nThe penalty survived until Hogsett removed it early in his term.\n\n\u201cWithout a doubt that was a deterrent because it was a disincentive to try to capture the most,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cBut now we can institute recycling without fear of penalty.\u201d\n\nLack of political will\n\nIn the early 1990s Indiana's legislature adopted sweeping changes to how solid waste is managed, creating an explosion of recycling programs \u2014 everywhere but in Marion County.\n\nThe law created county solid waste management districts to serve as dedicated, independent experts to develop recycling programs and set the rates necessary to run them. But it exempted Marion County, largely because of Covanta\u2019s incinerator.\n\nObservers say those districts effectively removed the politics from recycling decisions \u2014 and more than 100 cities and towns across the state pursued recycling. Indiana\u2019s recycling rate rose to 17 percent, even without a comprehensive program in the state\u2019s largest city.\n\nBut in Marion County, politicians still held the reins. And they were loath to raise money to pay for recycling. Arland said it feels good to say the city has universal recycling, but it comes with a price tag.\n\n\"It requires political will to make it happen and a City-County Council willing to put its neck on the line if taxes needed to go up to support it,\" he said. \"That may have changed now, but at the end of the day it just was not possible in the late '70s and early '80s.\"\n\nIn fact, the taboo on raising rates was so strong city politicians not only failed to launch a viable recycling program, they also declined to raise the solid waste fee for more than 30 years.\n\nToday's solid waste fee does not even cover the true cost of trash disposal. To cover the shortfall \u2014 a number that continues to grow \u2014 the city has been drawing down a fund that is expected to be depleted in a few years. When that happens, rates will need to rise or the city will need to rob funds used for other city services.\n\n\u201cIt was a very unpopular thing as mayor to increase rates,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cRecycling inherently became political, and the problem just continued to compound over the years.\u201d\n\nEven as far back as 1991, for example, Goldsmith stumped on increasing recycling options. In the end, however, he proved reluctant to invest in a program that a local trash hauler at the time said the city considered a \u201cnecessary nuisance.\u201d\n\nStill, Goldsmith takes credit for creating the city's curbside leaf collection program and for conducting studies that looked at increasing curbside pick-up. In a statement to the Star, the former mayor said his administration did not want to add charges to make recycling mandatory. Peterson did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nNot everyone thought of it that way, however. Residents increasingly asked for a program. And at least one Indianapolis glass recycling company said it teetered on the edge of closure. Strategic Materials blamed the city for the company's inability to operate at full capacity. Company officials said they would not have located here if the city had no intention of establishing a comprehensive program.\n\n\u201cI thought the city would implement curbside (recycling) countywide; everybody led me to believe that,\u201d Ed McMahon told the Indianapolis Star in an April 1996 article. He was the vice president for the northern region of Strategic Materials, which still operates \u2014 below capacity \u2014 in the city.\n\n\u201cI would think sooner or later they\u2019ll have to recycle,\u201d McMahon said more than 20 years ago, \u201cthe rest of the world is.\u201d\n\nEmploying their \"necessary nuisance\" philosophy, city officials did reluctantly back into a subscription recycling program. Many cities that embraced recycling achieved recycling rates of 40 percent or more by charging residents more to throw away trash, less to recycle. But Indianapolis did the opposite: residents have to pay as much as $99 a year for the privilege of recycling.\n\nAnd the results, critics say, were predictable. Only 10 percent of residents have opted into the program. The city acknowledges both its participation and recycling rates are low, Bennett said, \"even among participants in a voluntary program.\"\n\nBallard tried, but flopped\n\nAs advances in oil and gas drilling, wind and solar power, and electric vehicles caught on \u2014 revolutionizing America\u2019s energy mix and making it an exporter of fossil fuels \u2014 Indianapolis stuck with its 1970s Energy Crisis-era waste management strategy.\n\nThe incinerator contract was up for renewal in 2008, yet the city didn't recognize a need for change, and stayed its course.\n\nBy 2014, a group funded by companies including Procter & Gamble, PepsiCo and Coca-Cola sent a letter to the city offering interest-free financing \u201cto support the deployment of a curbside recycling program.\u201d Other cities had received between $3 million and $7 million.\n\nThe Closed Loop Fund, as the industry group is called, had its eyes trained on Indianapolis, which is surrounded by the companies' plants and facilities across the state and region.\n\nThe city, however, left that offer on the table.\n\n\u201cThe city was offered significant resources to get a program started, and they declined that opportunity,\u201d Hamilton said. \u201cIt was incredibly frustrating to me as a leader trying to bring curbside to all.\"\n\nInstead, then-Mayor Ballard, who was widely seen as a champion of green causes, signed a $112 million deal with Covanta to combine its waste incinerator operations with a recycling program, a move whose shortcomings were later revealed on an international stage.\n\nUnder that set-up, all waste \u2014 including trash and recyclables \u2014 would still be tossed together in one bin at the end of Indianapolis driveways. Then, machines at Covanta\u2019s facility would pluck the recyclable goods out from all that garbage. Those materials would go on to a recycling facility, while the trash would make its way to the incinerator.\n\nBallard, who declined requests for comment for this story, said at the time that the deal would finally bring recycling to the city.\n\n\u201cThe mayor and city were looking for a one-stop-shop solution by keeping it all under Covanta,\u201d said John Barth, a former Democratic city-county councilman during Ballard\u2019s time in office. \u201cBut that was more a good sell than good recycling.\u201d\n\nCritics likened Covanta's proposed process to \u201cdirty recycling.\u201d They argued the recyclable materials would be contaminated by garbage and rendered unusable \u2014 that was the case when recyclers rejected materials from a similar plant in Alabama. It also would have left other recyclables, such as glass and some plastics, destined for the inferno.\n\nA lawsuit challenged the contract, saying it was forged behind closed doors without public input or a competitive bidding process. After a prolonged battle, the Indiana Court of Appeals ultimately nixed the deal in 2016.\n\n\u201cIf that deal had gone through,\u201d Mitchell said, \u201cit would have literally killed the ability to do a world class recycling program in this city.\u201d\n\nThe impracticality of Ballard\u2019s plan was revealed in 2017 when China announced it was tired of sorting through America\u2019s trash.\n\nFor years, China had accepted as much as half of the world's trash. But then it said the recyclables the U.S. and other countries were sending over were too contaminated \u2014 either with the wrong items, such as garden hoses, or the right items in the wrong way, such as dirty containers.\n\nHad Ballard's deal gone through, Indianapolis would have committed to a $112 million combined trash and recycling program just as other cities were scrambling to keep garbage and recyclables separate.\n\nIt was well-intentioned, Mitchell and Barth acknowledge, but misguided. Not taking into account the recycling industry\u2019s needs, Indianapolis\u2019 one attempt failed.\n\nThe defeat of Ballard's decision, however, cleared the way for a new program.\n\n\u201cThe city emerged from what many saw as an impending disaster to one with tremendous potential,\u201d said Scott Mouw, the senior director for strategy and research at The Recycling Partnership.\n\nOpportunity for the future\n\nSome wonder if Indianapolis will repeat some of its old mistakes.\n\nMany major cities have set their sights on growing the amount they recycle by 2020 and to reaching zero waste by 2030 or 2035.\n\nIndianapolis has promised to create a universal curbside recycling program, but its launch won't be complete until 2025, although some preliminary work to deploy the blue recycling carts may begin before then.\n\nCity officials say the 2025 target is necessary to ensure residents are educated and ready to recycle. Recycling advocates are not convinced.\n\nThat target date coincides with the expiration of the city\u2019s contract with its trash hauler, Republic Services. Like the Covanta contract, the Republic contract has been continually renewed, most recently in 2015.\n\nMitchell said she thinks the program could and would be in place sooner if not for the contract. And Johnson said residents shouldn\u2019t have to wait six more years.\n\nCost also remains a question. Some cities charge more than Indianapolis to provide their recycling and waste disposal services, Bennett said. And Indianapolis officials \u2014 anticipating the day the city's waste disposal fund runs dry \u2014 are closely examining fees.\n\n\"Our focus is really on the future of solid waste as a whole, knowing that the funding model we now have doesn\u2019t work this way forever,\" Bennett said.\n\nIt is unclear if the city will have to raise the solid waste fee to expand recycling, said Katie Robinson, director of the Indianapolis Office of Sustainability. The city will explore creating a solid waste management district, she added, and look to partner with the Closed Loop Fund and Recycling Partnership to offset costs.\n\nStill, Mouw, Mitchell and others are hopeful it will be different this time.\n\nRecycling advocates say it's hard to overstate the impact \u2014 or the opportunity \u2014 the China announcement represents.\n\nIt sent shock waves through the industry. U.S. programs are now wondering how they can produce cleaner recyclables and where they will send them.\n\nThe Recycling Partnership, Closed Loop and others say the absence of a comprehensive recycling program gives Indianapolis a unique opportunity to build a new system set up to succeed.\n\n\"Given everything that's been going on internationally,\" Robinson said, \"I actually think Indianapolis is best positioned to develop a pretty extraordinary program and develop it correctly.\"\n\nThe city can educate residents on how to use it. It can enhance facilities with technology to better sort the materials. It can learn from other cities. And it can work with manufacturers around the state to put the recyclables to use.\n\n\"The more close-to-home we can keep the materials ... the more we can generate the jobs, economic benefits and environmental benefits,\" Bennett said. \"And that\u2019s how the future is different from the past this time.\"\n\nMitchell and others feel hopeful. She said a universal recycling program is a prerequisite before Indianapolis can consider itself a world class city \u2014 and it has a lot of work to get there.\n\n\u201cWe are a unique situation because it is so broken here that it means we get to start from scratch,\u201d she said. \u201cBut my biggest fear in this whole situation, with the China ban and starting our own program, is that the state and Indianapolis don\u2019t squeeze every last drop out of this opportunity.\u201d\n\nSarah Bowman and Emily Hopkins cover the environment for IndyStar.

MOMOS/WIKIMEDIA\n\nNew York City spends more on arts and culture than any other city in the United States\u2014and more than any single state. The budget of the city\u2019s Department of Cultural Affairs exceeds that of the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. The city has been funding the arts since the 19th century, but until now City Hall has never embarked on a comprehensive review of where all that money goes and what it does.\n\nThe result of that effort is a 180-page report released today called \u201cCREATENYC: A Cultural Plan for All New Yorkers,\u201d which aims to reorient the city\u2019s cultural life toward neglected corners of the five boroughs by bringing the arts to previously ignored neighborhoods and pushing some of the jewels in the city\u2019s cultural crown to make a greater effort towards getting residents of those neighborhoods through their doors.\n\n\u201cWe are clear: there are no cultural deserts in New York City,\u201d Tom Finkelpearl, the commissioner of the city\u2019s Department of Cultural Affairs, said in an interview. \u201cThere are arts organizations and artists in every part of the city, but there are not necessarily well-resourced artists and arts organizations in every part of the city. There are parts of the city and communities that remain underserved.\u201d\n\nThe Jamaica Center for Arts and Learning. COURTESY JCAL\n\nThe plan calls for the agency to begin immediately increasing its support for arts organizations in those neighborhoods, including those on city-owned property, which already receive significant funding from the city in exchange for having a free or reduced-cost admissions policy. Known as the Cultural Institutions Group (CIG), these city-affiliated museums include the Met and the Museum of Natural History, but also Wave Hill in the Bronx, the Jamaica Center for Arts and Learning, El Museo del Barrio, and other institutions farther from the city\u2019s core.\n\nThe new plan advocates for translations services for arts organizations, new funding to support cultural workers with disabilities, and a professional development program aiming to help people of color ascend the ranks of leadership at the city\u2019s museums and art spaces. Under the plan, the city would also help arts organizations lower their carbon footprint and increase direct support to artists, particularly those working with and in historically disenfranchised communities. In addition, at a press conference today unveiling the plan, officials said that they would continue to survey organizations on the diversity of their boards and staffs, with results potentially influencing funding decisions.\n\n\u201cWe need to look at culture in terms of all the benefits that New Yorkers receive from being residents of this really great city,\u201d said Arnold Lehman, a former head of the Brooklyn Museum and a member of the advisory committee that authored the report. \u201cThe challenge is that not everyone shares equally in it, in part because some people are not interested, but mostly because over many, many decades a kind of elitism has come to be associated with culture and it hasn\u2019t had an all-city approach.\u201d\n\nCity officials embarked on a massive outreach effort to put the cultural plan together, meeting by their own account with almost 200,000 New Yorkers in workshops across the five boroughs over the course of the past year. But they did so only at the prodding of the City Council, which passed a bill two years ago mandating that New York follow cities like Chicago, Denver, and Houston in systematically plotting its cultural strategy.\n\nCity Hall initially resisted the effort.\n\nVan Bramer. NEW YORK CITY COUNCIL\n\n\u201cSome folks would argue that in a city as rich as ours is in cultural attractions, and so full of artists, why do you need to do a cultural plan?\u201d said Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer, who sponsored the legislation. \u201cAnd if we have a plan, then we have to follow through on that plan and actually do stuff, and some folks don\u2019t want to be tied down to such a firm commitment.\u201d\n\nBut, Van Bramer added, \u201cthere are many people in the city of New York who for whatever reason felt that all of those attractions and all of those institutions weren\u2019t for them, or they have a hesitation about accessing them, or inability to go to them. We have an obligation to tear down those barriers and find out where the gaps and inequities were. We are doing a lot. We are the cultural capital of the world. It\u2019s about being self-reflective and acknowledging that we are doing it as well as we want to.\u201d\n\nOfficials were unwilling to put a price tag on how much all of these initiatives will cost. The city already spends half a billion dollars a year on culture when the DCA\u2019s budget ($188.1 million for fiscal year 2018), capital costs, and education programs are counted, according to Van Bramer. Finkelpearl said that the initiative to green the city\u2019s arts institutions would cost $25 million, and that the effort to increase access for the disabled would cost around $10 million, with an additional $1 million being sent to CIG institutions that increase access for disenfranchised communities. Mayor Bill de Blasio and the City Council have also been upping their funding for the DCA in recent years.\n\n\u201cWe allocated significant funding already, but clearly the report is challenging us to do even more, and I anticipate and welcome that,\u201d Van Bramer said.\n\nA sample IDNYC card. COURTESY CITY OF NEW YORK\n\nDespite those funding increases, many in the art world do not see New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio as a champion of the arts in the way that his predecessor, Mike Bloomberg, was. Bloomberg is a collector of Old Masters, and helped bring to the city major public projects like Olafur Eliasson\u2019s The New York City Waterfalls (2008), Paul Ramirez Jonas\u2019s Key to the City (2010), and most famously, The Gates (1979\u20132005) of Christo and Jeanne-Claude. Asked what would be the paradigmatic de Blasio cultural initiative on that scale, Finkelpearl said the IDNYC program, which created a municipal identification card for all city residents who wanted one, regardless of citizenship status, and permitted holders free membership at several city arts institutions.\n\nThere had been concern among officials affiliated with some of the city\u2019s major institutions that the cultural plan would mean less funding for them. The Met, for instance, is already dealing with a budget shortfall and earlier this year drafted a plan to institute a mandatory admission fee for visitors from outside New York State, a proposal that the city is currently considering. But funding for such institutions will hold steady for now, according to the plan released today.\n\nAs the city embarked on its effort to put the plan together, it also faced criticism from some who feared that it would not do enough to address the affordability crisis that artists face in a city of rising rents and disappearing studio, rehearsal, and performance spaces. \u201cThe People\u2019s Cultural Plan,\u201d an alternative put forward by a trio of artists earlier this summer, pointed out that real-estate companies with ties to the de Blasio administration were contracted to work on blueprint. The PCP, as it is known, calls for fair wages for artists, commercial rent control, and community land trusts for artist housing.\n\nArtists, said Jenny Dubnau, who is one of the authors of the alternative plan, need to reckon with how they are often used by real-estate interests to increase gentrification, as well as the overall expense of working in the city.\n\n\u201cOur biggest issue is with what the plan doesn\u2019t do,\u201d said Dubnau, \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make recommendations to address gentrification and displacement, which is affecting poor communities and communities of color and harshly affecting artists and art organization. We need to speak out against the ways that the branding of the arts is being used to raise property values in poor neighborhoods.\u201d\n\nThe Center for an Urban Future, a think tank, has issued two reports in the past decade detailing the difficulties New York has in providing a welcoming home for artists and arts organizations. However, a recent CUF study noted that there are more artists in New York than there were a decade ago, proof that the long-rumored exodus of city artists to midsize cities eager to poach them has not actually occurred. At least not yet.\n\n\u201cWe believe there are cracks,\u201d Finkelpearl said. \u201cAnd if enough people are talking about how the city is too expensive to be an artist in, then there will be a breaking point.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut it is not happening,\u201d he added. \u201cArtists are still moving here.\u201d", "title": "First-Ever New York City Cultural Plan Calls for Funding Institutions in Underserved Communities, Accessibility, Environmental Improvements", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['New York']"}, {"id": 464, "city": "['Los Angeles']", "url": "https://www.housingwire.com/articles/49777-hud-city-of-los-angeles-reach-landmark-settlement-in-accessible-housing-dispute/", "text": "The Department of Housing and Urban Development reached a settlement with the City of Los Angeles Friday that will put an end to a years-long battle between the two over the city\u2019s obligation to provide accessible housing for the disabled.\n\nAccording to the \u201clandmark\u201d agreement, the city will pay what will eventually amount to hundreds of millions of dollars to enhance handicap accessibility for residents living in its low-income housing.\n\nThe exact sum will depend on how long it takes the city to complete the requirements spelled out in the agreement, which states that the value will average a minimum of $20 million per year.\n\nThe work includes the development of 10,000 units of new affordable housing over the next 10 years, including 1,500 accessible units for the disabilities \u2013 a number that exceeds current state and federal requirements.\n\nThe city will also retrofit existing housing developments that do not meet accessibility standards to create an additional 3,100 housing units for individuals with disabilities.

Marisa's parents fought the school district to place her in a private school where they say she is flourishing.\n\nVIRGINIA BEACH, Va. \u2014 With more than a quarter of its 67,214 students coming from military families, the school district in Virginia Beach is one of the most military-connected divisions in the country.\n\nThe region is home to six aircraft carriers, dozens of ships and hundreds of aircraft. It hosts the largest U.S. naval base in the world, half the Navy SEAL population, a nuclear shipyard, and thousands of military families and defense contractors who anchor the economy.\n\nThe Virginia Beach City Public School district has many programs supporting military families that are often recognized for excellence.\n\nBut when it comes to special education, some military families say Virginia Beach is failing their children. Half a dozen military families who spoke with Stars and Stripes said their special-needs children fell through the cracks, and experts working with them said the children were denied services they need to learn.\n\n\u201cI felt like we were a burden, like we were expendable,\u201d said Christine Kemper, wife of a retired Navy SEAL. Kemper said her older children breezed through the school district. But when their youngest started having trouble, school officials denied that he needed help and asked her if she was sure she wanted to \u201clabel\u201d her child. After battling the district for months \u2014 with the help of the charity SEALkids, Inc. and an advocate that the nonprofit provided \u2014 the couple put their child in an expensive private school, where the only accommodation he needed was to sit in the front of the class.\n\n\u201cHe went from failing reading to being an accelerated reader,\u201d she said.\n\nJan Price said she and her husband, a retired admiral, fought the school district to have their daughter\u2019s learning disability acknowledged. The Prices got their daughter tested privately and said that only then did she get the accommodation she needed to go from failing math to getting an A in calculus.\n\n\u201cThe system doesn\u2019t work for them,\u201d Price said. \u201cIt makes them feel broken.\u201d\n\nTheir advocate, Amy Courtney, said she has seen dozens of similar cases in the district. She worked for 15 years as a school child psychologist and behavior specialist in the nearby Chesapeake School District. After retiring in 1995, she has worked as a paid advocate for parents of special-needs children \u2014 working privately and for SEALkids.\n\n\u201cIf I am needed on behalf of an admiral, what does that tell you about other families?\u201d she said.\n\nThe school district disputes the characterization by these families. Deputy City Attorney for Public Education Kamala Lannetti said Virginia Beach receives a disproportionate number of military children with special needs and is \u201cgenerally considered a division of choice.\u201d Because of the large concentration of military families and medical services, Virginia Beach is one of just five locations where the Navy assigns severe special-needs families.\n\nShe said special education is complex and often fraught with different interpretations of the law, which provides for every student to receive a \u201cfree and appropriate public education.\u201d She noted that out of the district\u2019s 10,000 kids with disabilities, there are \u201ca handful\u201d who claimed they have had issues.\n\nLannetti stressed the school district\u2019s dedication to all military families: \u201cWe have probably the best transition program for (military) children in the country.\u201d\n\nDivision spokeswoman Heather Allen, addressing concerns of the special-needs parents, highlighted the district\u2019s record of serving all military families: from successful counselors on staff and peer support programs aimed at increasing military awareness to awards for excellence.\n\nThe Navy said its school liaison officers work closely with the school district and will reach out when there are issues. Charles Clymer, the Navy\u2019s program manager for child and youth education services, acknowledges that while the liaison officers can exert what he called \u201ca quiet influence,\u201d that\u2019s as far as they will go.\n\n\u201cIf a parent wants us to try to strong-arm, we\u2019d be hard-pressed.\u201d\n\nThere are 7,926 special needs students in the Virginia Beach school district and 2,300 more who require accommodation but not an Individualized Education Program. At the last official count in 2015, the district said there were 1,546 military-connected students requiring an IEP, with an unspecified number requiring some accommodation.\n\nThe district receives federal aid to offset the loss of property taxes from exempt military families. It also receives educational grants from the Department of Defense Educational Activities agency. In 2014, Virginia Beach was a recipient of a multi-year, $1 million DoDEA grant for special education that went to seven schools to provide extra resources for military connected students.\n\nThe grant also paid for an instructional specialist who works in collaboration with the district\u2019s parents, and a support liaison for military special-education families. Those two officials have been asked to make a presentation about their success at a state education conference later this month, Allen said.\n\nCourtney says those successes don\u2019t negate failures she has seen for military families.

Features often include wheelchair-accessible play space and wide paths so that children can walk or roll easily between playground equipment.

Michael Kowalczyk/Getty Images\n\nSixteen percent of all Philadelphians\u2014roughly 246,000 people\u2014had a physical, emotional, or cognitive disability in 2016, according to the latest data from the U.S. Census Bureau\u2019s American Community Survey. The share was the highest of the nation\u2019s 10 largest cities, with only San Antonio coming close with a rate of 14.1 percent.\n\nThe data also show that American cities with high poverty rates tend to have higher rates of disabilities.\n\nThe Census Bureau defines a disability as \u201ca long-lasting physical, mental, or emotional condition that can make it difficult for a person to do activities such as walking, climbing stairs, dressing, bathing, learning, or remembering; it can also impede a person from being able to go outside the home alone or to work at a job.\u201d\n\nThe census also breaks the data into disability categories, which include hearing, vision, cognitive, and ambulatory (whether a person can walk). Although the 10 cities had similar shares of residents with hearing and vision challenges, Philadelphia stood out when it came to those with cognitive and ambulatory issues, with rates of 7.7 percent and 9.6 percent, respectively; some in the city reported that they experience both.\n\nThe census defines a cognitive disability as \u201ca physical, mental, or emotional problem, having difficulty remembering, concentrating, or making decisions\u201d and an ambulatory challenge as \u201chaving serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs.\u201d The data are based on self-reporting by those surveyed; there is no information about the underlying condition causing the disability.\n\nResearch shows that many cognitive and ambulatory problems are driven by age. Thirty-two percent of disabled Philadelphians in 2016 were at least 65, and among residents older than 75, more than half\u201455 percent\u2014reported a disability. The percentages of disabilities among older populations in the other cities were similar.\n\nPhiladelphia, however, had a higher share of adults ages 35 to 64 with cognitive or ambulatory difficulties. Nine percent of Philadelphians in this age group had cognitive issues, while most of the other largest cities had percentages below 5 percent. For those with ambulatory difficulties, the figure was nearly 13 percent for Philadelphia but 7 percent or less for most of the other cities.\n\nConnections between disability and poverty\n\nNationally, nearly one-third of working-age adults who have a disability live below the poverty line. Figure 6 shows the 2016 disability rates for the 10 poorest cities with populations of at least 350,000. The average disability rate for these cities, each of which had a poverty rate of at least 22 percent, was 14.9 percent, compared with 10.8 percent for the 10 largest cities, most of which had poverty rates below 20 percent. Not surprisingly, the cities with the highest disability rates, Detroit and Cleveland, also had the highest poverty rates, which stood at about 35 percent for each in 2016. Those were the only two cities with disability rates higher than Philadelphia\u2019s.\n\nIn Philadelphia in 2016, about 22 percent of the city\u2019s poor were disabled, a higher share than in the rest of the 10 largest cities. Among the 10 poorest cities, only Cleveland had a higher share of disabled residents living in poverty (nearly 24 percent).\n\nDepending on their incomes, many Philadelphians with disabilities receive government assistance through a range of programs; for example, more than 55,000 residents under age 65 qualify for Social Security disability benefits.\n\nThe city has various programs in place to support residents with disabilities, particularly those in poverty. In 2017, Mayor Jim Kenney established the Mayor\u2019s Office for People With Disabilities to ensure Philadelphia\u2019s adherence to the Americans With Disabilities Act. In addition, the Philadelphia Housing Development Corp. operates the Adaptive Modifications Program, which provides structural housing modifications for residents with permanent physical disabilities who meet income thresholds and other requirements. The program has a two-year waiting list.\n\nResidents with cognitive disabilities also receive city support, including access to employment services, nursing care, residential support, and other forms of assistance from the Philadelphia Department of Behavioral Health and Intellectual disAbility Services (DBHIDS). Funding is provided by the federal and state governments, and the program is administered by the city.\n\nAs of March 2018, 4,144 city residents were receiving various levels of care through DBHIDS; because of the severity and nature of their disabilities, these individuals qualify for lifetime benefits. Another 2,119 people were on the waiting list.\n\nLarry Eichel directs Pew\u2019s Philadelphia research initiative and Katie Martin is a researcher on the team.", "title": "Disability Rate in Philadelphia Is Highest of Largest U.S. Cities", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "['disables']", "annot_city": "['Philadelphia']"}, {"id": 472, "city": "['San Antonio']", "url": "https://www.tpr.org/post/san-antonio-residents-disabilities-inclusion-accessibility-are-key", "text": "Inclusion is important for individuals with disabilities but often times, taking part in activities, community events, and employment opportunities requires overcoming extra hurdles.\n\nAn estimated 14 percent of the San Antonio population lives with a disability, according to census data from 2011-2015.\n\nMeeting and interacting with new people outside one's everyday network can be a struggle for anyone, but is even more trying for individuals with mental or physical disabilities.

From 2014 to 2016, the American Community Survey's estimates showed that 26,000 fewer Dallas children are living in poverty \u2014 dropping the rate to 30.6 percent from 37.8 percent. The overall poverty rate also fell, and the city has a relatively low rate among residents 65 and older.\n\nBut the decrease in child poverty still left Dallas tied with Phoenix for the third-worst such rate among major U.S. cities. And the city also continues to have a fairly high overall poverty rate.\n\n\"We have started progress. We've got some good trends going,\" said Regina Montoya, the task force's co-chair. \"But the trends have to continue because we've got a big issue in front of us.\"\n\nIt's unclear exactly why the estimated numbers fell in Dallas. Other large cities \u2014 such as Houston, Austin, San Antonio, Los Angeles and San Diego \u2014 reported similar drops, suggesting larger economic trends were a factor, although Philadelphia's rate, which is now the worst in major U.S. cities, remained virtually the same. And median income in Dallas rose in those years, although not as fast as it did in other cities.\n\nMontoya said the so-called living-wage requirements of city contractors and Parkland Memorial Hospital's minimum wage increase might have helped make a dent in Dallas. And she said Dallas ISD initiatives have helped students and their parents.\n\nShe said the poverty task force's work has shown that the city's various government agencies can't continue a \"business as usual\" approach.\n\nFor the most part, Dallas City Hall has not. The poverty rates and what Mayor Mike Rawlings has described as the city's \"barbell economy\" \u2014 a glut of rich and poor residents with few in the middle class \u2014 have loomed over City Hall for years.\n\nCity leaders have made efforts to reverse that. This year, the city created the Office of Welcoming Communities and Immigrant Affairs because one in four Dallas residents is foreign-born and may not seek out city services, such as free income tax preparation.\n\nThe City Council also recently approved a budget that includes a living wage for all city employees, as well as $287,000 for an English-as-a-second-language program and $300,000 for a teen pregnancy initiative. The task force has reported that teen pregnancy and the language barrier are two of the biggest factors in poverty.\n\nThe council \u2014 driven in part by a feeling that Dallas Area Rapid Transit had given the working poor the short shrift in Dallas \u2014 installed new DART board members. They've long weighed banning employers from inquiring about criminal histories on initial job applications. And they've raised housing standards and have pushed for more affordable housing in the city.\n\nBut progress on those fronts will take time. Council member Mark Clayton, a co-chair of the task force, said he is pleased with the city's efforts so far.\n\n\"The task force gave voice to what we all knew but didn't know how to define,\" Clayton said. \"Once we knew how to define what the problem was, it allowed us to ask the right questions.\"\n\nOne anecdotal sign of progress Clayton has seen is that prominent nonprofit officials, City Council members, Dallas ISD officials and other civic leaders are showing up more to the task force meetings and trying to get involved.\n\n\"The audience is bigger and higher-level than it has ever been,\" he said.\n\nAt Tuesday's meeting, Dallas ISD Superintendent Michael Hinojosa touted the district's efforts to grow pre-K enrollment, expand early college programs, integrate students from different economic backgrounds and help homeless children receive services.\n\nHinojosa bemoaned the failure of the board of trustees to allow voters a chance to raise taxes \u2014 and provide between $42 million and $123 million more dollars for the school district. He vowed to try again to pass the increase.\n\n\"If you don't have any new money, that means people are going to be competing for the money you have,\" Hinojosa said. \"And there are winners and losers, and that's what creates the complexity I live in every single day.\"\n\nClayton said Dallas ISD, City Hall and other government agencies need more analytics on the drivers of poverty and whether their programs are having any impact. He said the data has helped already, but it's difficult to fund programs on a larger scale until officials can prove they are working. Clayton said programs can't be funded \"off a hunch.\"\n\nStill, the task force and the focus on poverty in recent years will make a difference.\n\n\"We're light-years ahead of where we were a few years ago,\" Clayton said. \"We're not going to work off the hunch anymore.

Do you mind if we check your blood pressure?\u2019\u201d de Narayan said.\n\nShe says it can take several encounters to gain someone\u2019s trust and get them into care.\n\nThe medical team also has to get creative with the remedies they prescribe, because simple things can be hard to come by.\n\n\u201cSuch simple things,\u201d de Narayan said. \u2018\u201cYou go to the doctor, because you have a sore throat, and they\u2019re like, \u2018Gargle warm salt water.\u2019 Well, out here, it\u2019s like, \u2018Ok, well where am I going to get water?\u2019\u201d\n\nBut those limitations don\u2019t stop the street medicine team from helping people.\n\nSopain Lawson has been living in this spot under I-20 for most of the summer.

The clinic estimates its street medicine helped at least 300 people connect to care in 2018.\n\nThese programs are important, Withers says, because the health care system isn\u2019t reaching people who are homeless.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s all these populations: they\u2019re still sick, they\u2019re still coming to the emergency rooms, and we\u2019re not dealing with them well,\u201d he said. \u201cThey stay in the hospital longer.

When it took effect in January 2008, requiring businesses with 20 or more employees to contribute money toward their health care expenditures, 10.4 percent of San Franciscans \u2014 15 percent of the working-age population \u2014 were uninsured.\n\nAs the program\u2019s 10-year anniversary approaches, the ordinance, together with the federal Affordable Care Act, appears to have helped close that gap almost entirely.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census\u2019 2016 American Community Survey, 96.7 percent of San Franciscans now have health care coverage, well over the statewide average of 92.7 percent. When you add in the City Option, a program created by the ordinance that provides limited health care services for 13,500 uninsured residents and manages medical reimbursement accounts for 186,000 others, that figure brushes up against 100 percent.\n\n\u201cThe two work incredibly well together,\u201d Supervisor Hillary Ronen said of the federal and municipal laws.\n\nAlong with that success, though, some significant issues have surfaced.\n\nPerhaps the biggest is the fate of one aspect of the City Option, a growing pool of money that employers have placed in medical reimbursement accounts, or MRAs, for workers to help cover what insurance does not. Those funds, managed by the city\u2019s Department of Public Health, now amount to $160 million, The Chronicle has learned, not including another $17 million in more than 28,000 accounts deemed inactive and recently closed for lack of use.\n\nThe growing pool of MRA money, along with the thousands of accounts so far made inactive, suggests that many workers are not using their accounts fully or at all. The average amount in each individual account is $1,478, the Public Health Department says, but the average annual claim amounts to less than a third of that, $441.\n\nAnd while the city is obligated to retain the MRA funds for the use of enrolled employees only, health plan officials are currently reviewing just how the accounts, both active and inactive, will be managed going forward.\n\nSome question whether the city and some employers are doing enough to educate workers about accessing the funds set aside for them. Others have wondered if the city has properly reconciled the requirements of the ordinance and the Affordable Care Act, which has provided much of what San Francisco\u2019s initiative was meant to do.\n\nMeanwhile, the city has not publicized any data demonstrating the program\u2019s successes and problems. The San Francisco Health Plan, which oversees the City Option for the Department of Public Health, has not been required to publish figures on its usage. The city\u2019s Office of Labor Standards Enforcement is supposed to put out annual reports showing Health Care Security Ordinance contributions, but the last published report is from 2013.\n\nThe City Option \u201cis essentially a stopgap solution that has become institutionalized,\u201d said Micah Weinberg, president of the Bay Area Council Economic Institute. \u201cWhen we passed the Health Care Security Ordinance, the idea was this is what we needed to get to the passage of the ACA or some other health care legislation. But it is rare that government programs are put in place and then they go away.\u201d\n\nThe City Option was created, alongside the Health Care Security Ordinance, to provide two separate patches for health care coverage gaps. It would channel employer set-aside funds to Healthy San Francisco, which provides services to San Francisco residents, or to the MRAs, which anyone who worked for a qualifying San Francisco business could have.\n\nAfter the Affordable Care Act expanded Medi-Cal coverage in 2013, the number participating in Healthy San Francisco dropped from nearly 60,000 to 13,500. The city\u2019s administrative costs shrank as well, from $159.9 million in 2013-14 to $74.4 million in 2015-16.\n\nAccording to the San Francisco Office of Labor Standards Enforcement, in 2016, employers affected by the ordinance spent 89 percent of their set-aside funds, about $2.05 billion, on insurance premiums. The remaining 11 percent went toward privately managed MRAs and City Option programs.\n\nIn 2014, the Board of Supervisors closed a loophole in the 2008 ordinance that had allowed employers to reclaim funds they\u2019d paid into private MRAs after two years if workers hadn\u2019t used them. Since January, 100 percent of those funds must be held in perpetuity.\n\nPart-time and low-income workers, particularly in the retail and hospitality sectors, are more likely to have MRAs rather than full insurance. Many others use their reimbursement accounts in conjunction with high-deductible coverage plans.\n\nThe City Option, say workers who do use it, provides a much-needed boost to cover health care costs.\n\nDamon Bird, 39, and his partner, Lauren Loiselle, are both cicerones, the beer equivalent of sommeliers. When they moved to San Francisco from Dallas three years ago, they discovered their new restaurant jobs came with a major perk: health insurance for the couple, plus a medical reimbursement account, which allowed Bird to have much-needed hernia surgery he had put off for years.\n\nIn Texas, he was paying more than $300 a month for an insurance plan with a $6,000 deductible. Saving enough money for surgery was impossible.\n\nIn San Francisco, Loiselle\u2019s job as the manager of a Mission bar and restaurant offered her and Bird health insurance with a much lower deductible. Bird asked his employer at the time to contribute his own health care funds to an MRA. Last year, the account had accrued enough money for Bird to have the operation. His final out-of-pocket cost: $500.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty miraculous,\u201d he said recently.\n\nAccording to the Department of Public Health, the City Option\u2019s MRA program has paid out $244 million in claims since its founding in 2008.\n\nAfter nearly 10 years, the reimbursement process appears to work well for those who have figured it out.\n\nLindsay Stripling, an artist and the manager at Outerlands restaurant in the Outer Sunset, pays for a Kaiser HMO plan out of pocket and then uses the City Option to cover expenses like orthopedic shoes and root canals. She receives a quarterly statement from her employer letting her know how much money has been transferred into the account. She submits receipts for medical expenses through the City Option website, receiving a check within a few days.\n\nShe has become a City Option evangelist to co-workers and friends. But, she cautioned, \u201cYou have to be on top of it yourself and show incentive to save your receipts. If you don\u2019t use (the account), the money is stagnant.\u201d\n\nBird concurs. His employer didn\u2019t know enough about the program to help him access the funds in his name, so he went to the office of the San Francisco Health Plan, which oversees the City Option for the Department of Public Health.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s confusing, and unless you spend some time with it, no one has any clear answers,\u201d Bird said.\n\nLanguage barriers may be one factor, despite the fact that the program\u2019s website, as well as its print educational materials, are available in English, Chinese (spoken Cantonese), Tagalog and Spanish.\n\nShaw San Liu of the Chinese Progressive Association said his organization, which often counsels non-English-speaking workers in the restaurant industry, said: \u201cNine times out of 10, talking to workers eligible for an account, they didn\u2019t know about it and it was difficult to access.\u201d\n\nColleen Chawla, deputy director of the San Francisco Department of Public Health, said, \u201cI feel like restaurant owners or other employers have a role in making employees know they\u2019re making contributions on their behalf. Employers, if they\u2019re making that contribution, I\u2019m sure they want their employees to use it.\u201d\n\nBut not many employers, it appears, are seeking help in accessing the program. The San Francisco Health Plan has six program administrators available for telephone and in-person training for employers and workers. Agency staffers, though, say they receive relatively few requests from employers each month.\n\nEmployers, meanwhile, particularly in the restaurant industry, continue to complain that the ordinance deters some businesses from adding staff for fear of incurring the ordinance\u2019s requirements.\n\nWhile the amount of unused MRA funds surprised her, Supervisor Hillary Ronen said the fact that individual accounts are not being fully accessed does not trouble her.\n\nMany of the lowest-cost health insurance plans carry huge deductibles, she said, creating a gap that MRA funds can fill. \u201cSure, they might not go to a doctor now,\u201d Ronen said, \u201cbut if they get into a car accident and have huge bills, they could use up their MRA in one day.\u201d\n\nLast year, the city decided to deactivate the accounts of employees who had not spent any funds for two years or did not respond to multiple notices warning them their accounts might be closed.\n\nGreg Wagner, chief financial officer for the Public Health Department, emphasized that the money in those accounts will remain within the City Option program, as required by ordinance. City controller Ben Rosenfield confirmed that the funds will remain in the San Francisco Health Plan\u2019s budget, and won\u2019t end up in any other part of the city\u2019s funds. Officials say participants only need to call to reinstate an account.\n\n\u201cThe San Francisco Health Plan is currently in the process of doing an actuarial review to figure out, of those dollars, how much of that (amount) is likely to have people come back and reopen the account,\u201d Wagner said.\n\nThe city will hold a pool in reserve for those reopened accounts and pass any excess to the other parts of the program.\n\nRonen said she was glad to hear that the San Francisco Health Plan is accruing more information about how people use the accounts.\n\n\u201cIt will be really useful to look at the data,\u201d Ronen said. \u201cHow is this working? Did we move in the right direction? Do we need to tweak things?\u201d\n\nJonathan Kauffman is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer.

Although it\u2019s already a nation-wide month of celebration, the state of Michigan holds a unique history that situates Hispanic Communities at the center of its urban story.\n\nBecause while Detroit\u2019s general population was declining, its Southwest neighborhoods were flourishing.\n\nImmigrants have always found a home in Detroit. With the steady stream of population growth offsetting some of its mass depopulation of the late 20th century, Mexicantown was no exception with massive amounts of Hispanic immigrants calling Detroit home.\n\nThroughout the steady decline, Mexicantown maintained a vibrant community within its borders. Bakeries and restaurants became major destinations for people throughout the entire Southeast Michigan region. Relevant cultural expressions throughout the neighborhood became a way for people to feel at home again once they left their home country, and oftentimes families behind.\n\nDespite the vibrant neighborhood\u2019s steady population, many services left the neighborhood. Hospitals and physicians left for the suburbs or more central locations closer to downtown Detroit. And for the people living in Mexicantown, this became a dire problem.\n\nRicardo Guzman is a lifelong resident of Mexicantown. When Detroit\u2019s services dried up, Guzman worked against the declining health system for his ill mother. Unfortunately, due to this lack of access to healthcare, she did pass away.\n\nGuzman believes it is a result of her death that the community came together to build CHASS Center. Working as a health clinic for low-income and impoverished people, CHASS created a system revolutionary for its time. An intersection of innovative ideas and culture-based care resulted in a community that would have access to healthcare for everyone in the neighborhood.\n\nThe beginnings of a healthcare revolution\n\nWithin a period of four years, the biggest hospitals around Southwest Detroit shut down along with the other businesses in the area. Leaving people without immediate healthcare in a with a loss of jobs and businesses. So the long distances to emergency rooms and regular healthcare mattered for people without vehicles who couldn\u2019t depend on public transportation.\n\n\u201cWhen they left, people around the community started asking \u2018Where are we going to go for our healthcare?\u2019\u201d Guzman said. \u201cWe were at a crossroads because there was no real answer.\u201d\n\nGuzman said this was a unique time for a clinic like CHASS. During the 1970s \u2013 a time when progressive ideas in fighting poverty were shared among both conservative and liberal politicians \u2013 federal funders saw major promise in a free clinic.\n\nIn 1969, the meetings started with the people in office at the time. Under the Republican administration of Michigan Governor Bob Milliken, the first grants came which helped establish the clinic out of a house rented from a local area church.\n\nThe innovative portion for the time was in creating a \u201cone-stop-shop\u201d for healthcare and social services. Someone who needed any healthcare assistance could go to one place.\n\n\u201cThe powers that be really liked that someone could go to one location and get health services, get social services, get some training that was available,\u201d Guzman said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s where it really took off for us because it was something new and they really liked that idea.\u201d\n\nCHASS as an innovative healthcare model\n\nWhat made CHASS an important part of the healthcare network in Detroit may have been what it couldn\u2019t do. Community Health Clinics are always wondering what happens if someone comes in that needs care beyond the scope of what they could provide, according to Guzman. This is where an important partnership was formed.\n\nA study was done on emergency room usage among the various populations around Detroit. It found that Hispanic Americans in Southwest Detroit were saying that they come to CHASS for everything, including emergencies. From their office, CHASS could send dire emergencies to emergency rooms around the city.\n\nGuzman referred to CHASS as a \u201cGatekeeper\u201d for the emergency room. Because most people were using the emergency rooms of Henry Ford Hospital and the DNC for general health issues instead of for most pressing emergencies, then CEO of Henry Ford Hospital Gail Warden took a serious interest in CHASS for the role it could play.\n\n\u201cHFHS really understood the relationship between a community health center as a primary care provider and an emergency room,\u201d Guzman said.\n\nA partnership between them now became a way for CHASS to have access to doctors and physicians from the Henry Ford Hospital.\n\nCHASS became a uniquely hispanic health center\n\nMost doctors at CHASS speak Spanish with their patients. And for a population of native speakers and,\n\noftentimes monolingual Spanish speakers, this gave CHASS an important role within the community.\n\nIn the time before CHASS came into being, the entire neighborhood had around six businesses owned by Hispanic Americans, according to Guzman. Throughout the \u201870s and \u201880s, the entrepreneurial spirit of the Hispanic community flourished with Hispanic people growing businesses along the main stretches of the neighborhood. A business network that would eventually christen the Southwest neighborhood \u2018Mexicantown.\u2019\n\nBut this didn\u2019t come without its struggles. Immigration officials would oftentimes come to C\n\nHASS looking for people slated for deportation. And like many other entities in the neighborhood, CHASS would protect the identities of everyone.\n\n\u201cIn the past, we\u2019ve had people come in asking if someone is in the center,\u201d Guzman said. \u201cAnd everyone at the front desk knew what to do, which is call me up and I\u2019d come and talk to them.\u201d\n\nGuzman depended on the laws protecting patients\u2019 privacy to make sure that people wouldn\u2019t risk deportation at his health center.\n\nAlthough immigration status remains at the center of national debates, the CHASS Center had to depend on laws protecting patients\u2019 rights over the laws governing immigration status at the time. Those same laws could have revoked the center\u2019s license to operate if it complied with immigration officials.\n\nThe CHASS Center will be 50 years old next year. And although it o\n\nperates as a free clinic, the constantly changing demographic of the neighborhood means that CHASS will have to change with it. Even now, budget worries make these changes seem inevitable as the model for funding community health centers becomes too difficult to predict.\n\nWhat may happen is that CHASS becomes a regular health office for people with insurance. Yet still, it stands that the neighborhood would not have been the same without its history of community members providing for each other.\n\nWhether it\u2019s in healthcare, social services or just being a good neighbor, CHASS made a model that carried Southwest Detroit\u2019s Hispanic Community through some of the most difficult times in the city\u2019s history. And it all started in a house rented from a church.

He contrasts that with the greater Milwaukee area of Wisconsin.\n\nIn 2016, the rural parts of both states shifted sharply to the right, matching the national trend. Minnesota, however, stayed blue, while Wisconsin went red. To understand why, take a look at the growth rates of the states\u2019 largest metro areas, both of which voted heavily for Clinton. Between 1970 and 2017, Greater Minneapolis grew at an annual rate of roughly 2 percent, above the national rate of 1.1 percent. The Minneapolis region\u2014home to a variety of corporate giants like Target\u2014now has roughly 3.6 million residents, up from 1.87 million in 1970. By contrast, Greater Milwaukee, buffeted by business closures and a shrinking middle class, grew at an annual rate of only 0.26 percent over the same period.\n\nIf, as Block suggests, population growth in major metropolitan areas is critical for Democrats, it is important to try to understand what makes the Minneapolis/St. Paul area such an outlier in the midwest.\n\nSomeone who has been studying that for a while now is Myles Shaver, a professor at the University of Minnesota\u2019s Carlson School of Management. You can watch him present his findings in a video here, where he explains what his research says about why the Twin Cities are home to 18 Fortune 500 companies\u2014more than any other metro area its size. As he told Derek Thompson, \u201cWe\u2019re not like Atlanta, where half of its Fortune 500s moved there. There is something about Minneapolis that makes us unusually good at building and keeping large companies.\u201d He went on to explain why that happens.\n\nShaver\u2019s theory, which he\u2019s developing into a book, is that Minneapolis is so successful at turning medium-size companies into giants because its most important resource never leaves the city: educated managers of every level, who can work at just about any company\u2026\u201cIt bears out the old adage: \u2018It\u2019s really hard to get people to move to Minneapolis, and it\u2019s impossible to get them to leave.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAs part of his research, Shaver interviewed about 2,700 of those educated managers and identified the factors that were both least and most important in their decision to live in the Minneapolis area. The least important included things like college/professional sports, tax rates, and cultural events. The most important factors were:\n\nJob opportunities\n\nStrong local economy\n\nGood place to raise children\n\nQuality public schools\n\nQuality health care\n\nDrilling down a bit deeper, Shaver found that 85 percent of people in the managerial class sent their children to public schools\u2014something that would be unheard of in most metro areas.\n\nThat brings us to the heart of what some people have called \u201cthe Minneapolis miracle.\u201d The confidence people have in the area\u2019s public schools is one effect of a law passed back in the 1970s called the \u201cFiscal Disparities Act.\u201d\n\nIn the 1960s, local districts and towns in the Twin Cities region offered competing tax breaks to lure in new businesses, diminishing their revenues and depleting their social services in an effort to steal jobs from elsewhere within the area. In 1971, the region came up with an ingenious plan that would help halt this race to the bottom, and also address widening inequality. The Minnesota state legislature passed a law requiring all of the region\u2019s local governments\u2014in Minneapolis and St. Paul and throughout their ring of suburbs\u2014to contribute almost half of the growth in their commercial tax revenues to a regional pool, from which the money would be distributed to tax-poor areas. Today, business taxes are used to enrich some of the region\u2019s poorest communities.\n\nNo other metro region in the country has ever replicated that strategy, but in 2015 Chicago\u2019s Metropolitan Planning Council wanted to know why Minneapolis was growing at almost five times the rate of their city. They came up with three reasons:\n\nThe Fiscal Disparities Act Education Quality of life\n\nNotice that both education and quality of life are largely dependent on the funding formula in the Fiscal Disparities Act.\n\nThe 1970s were a long time ago and it could be hard to convince other metropolitan areas to adopt the redistribution of commercial tax revenue that has been fueling growth in the Twin Cities area for decades now. But I suspect that many of them would identify with what the Chicago Metropolitan Planning Council found.\n\nNortheastern Illinois municipalities have a bad habit of giving away tax revenues to lure businesses to move from one suburb to the next or from a suburb to the City of Chicago, because they believe it will grow their overall tax base and create jobs locally. But this is often done without assessing the overall economic impact to the region and the effect is only a relocation of jobs, not net new job growth. Businesses are at an advantage because they know communities will compete for them. The Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning finds that in the Chicago region, \u201cLocal governments are spending or committing significant amounts of incentive dollars to firms that may generate sales tax revenues, but have low jobs multipliers and/or low wages.\u201d In other words, municipalities give up revenue that is supposed to go to public services or schools, and often no new net job growth is created regionally.\n\nIt is that race to the bottom to give away tax revenues for meager job growth at low wages that is debilitating to a community\u2019s quality of life. That is what the Minneapolis/St. Paul area figured out forty years ago and what continues to fuel its growth today. It certainly isn\u2019t the weather.", "title": "What Happens When a Metropolitan Area Shares the Wealth", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Minneapolis']"}, {"id": 486, "city": "['New York']", "url": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-disparities-academic-hospitals/few-poor-or-minority-patients-in-new-york-citys-academic-hospitals-idUSKBN15O25O", "text": "(Reuters Health) - Black patients are half as likely as white patients to get care at academic medical centers in New York City even after accounting for differences in health insurance, a recent study suggests.\n\nCompared to privately insured patients, people with coverage through Medicaid, the government health program for the poor, are three times less likely to receive treatment at these elite New York hospitals, the study also found. Uninsured patients are five times less likely to get care at academic hospitals.\n\n\u201cAcademic medical centers are generally better able to provide highly specialized care for patients with complex or rare illnesses,\u201d said lead study author Roosa Sofia Tikkanen, a researcher at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester who completed the work while at City University of New York School of Public Health at Hunter College.\n\n\u201cMost experts believe unequal access to high-quality health care contributes to disparities in health outcomes,\u201d Tikkanen added by email. \u201cIn New York City, life expectancy can differ by up to 10 years between two neighborhoods that are located just six subway stops apart.\u201d\n\nAbout 18 percent of patients at academic medical centers are black, compared with almost one-third at other hospitals in the city, the analysis of discharge data from 2009 and 2014 found.\n\nAt the same time, 22 percent of patients were insured by Medicaid at academic hospitals, compared with 42 percent at other hospitals in the city. And only 1 percent of academic hospital patients were uninsured, compared with 4 percent elsewhere.\n\nWhile Medicaid and uninsured patients accounted for nearly half of all patients at non-academic hospitals in the city, they made up less than one-quarter of inpatients at academic medical centers. At one-third of academic hospitals, less than 10 percent of patients had Medicaid or were uninsured.\n\nTo see how race, ethnicity and payer status affect the likelihood of being treated at an academic medical center, researchers analyzed data on adults discharged from hospitals in New York City in 2009 and 2014, and they also looked at similar data for Boston hospitals in 2009.\n\nIn Boston, uninsured and Medicaid patients were just as likely to be treated at academic medical centers as at other hospitals. And racial and ethnic minorities were slightly overrepresented at academic hospitals.\n\nIt\u2019s possible some of the differences between the two cities might be explained by the extensive public hospital network in New York, the authors note in the International Journal of Health Services.\n\nAll of the academic medical centers in Boston and New York are nonprofit hospitals, however, and enjoy tax exemptions worth tens of millions of dollars, the researchers point out. In exchange, they are expected to provide community benefits, including caring for Medicaid and uninsured patients.\n\nOne limitation of the study is that researchers didn\u2019t account for patients\u2019 diagnoses or severity of illnesses, which could influence which hospital they went to for care, the authors add. The analysis of two cities also might not reflect what happens in other communities.\n\nThe study also didn\u2019t examine the role of residential segregation or neighborhood poverty on use of academic medical centers, noted Asal Mohamadi Johnson, a public health researcher at Stetson University in Florida who wasn\u2019t involved in the study.\n\n\u201cThe issue of equity and fairness is at stake here,\u201d Johnson said by email. \u201cAcademic medical centers should be held to higher levels of ethical standards in providing care for low income and minority patients.\u201d\n\nWhen there are disparities in patients\u2019 access to care, academic medical centers may not offer the best possible education to new doctors, Johnson added.\n\n\u201cActive participation of academic medical centers in caring for non-whites and the poor prepares a more qualified and culturally competent generation of physicians and health care providers who will have more familiarity with the unique circumstances and barriers confronting these patients,\u201d Johnson said.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2kvPClc International Journal of Health Services, online February 2, 2017.", "title": "Few poor or minority patients in New York City\u2019s academic hospitals", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "['health', 'inequality']", "annot_city": "['New York']"}, {"id": 487, "city": "['Los Angeles']", "url": "https://www.kcet.org/shows/town-hall-los-angeles/las-growing-economic-gap-a-need-for-equity", "text": "Rising rents. Stagnant wages. Homelessness. Gentrification. Today's big stories in Los Angeles have a common thread: a gap in social and economic equity. How we solve these problems is a big question and one that can't be answered unless we understand how inequity has divided Los Angeles. That's where someone like Jennifer Ito comes into the picture.\n\nIto is the research director for the USC Program of Environmental and Regional Equity (PERE). She looks at the demographics-- all those numbers pertaining to the ethnic and economic make-up of a place-- and makes sense of them. She has co-authored studies, like \"Talkin' 'Bout Our Generations: Data Deliberation, and Destiny in a Changing America\" and \"Linking Innovation with Inclusion: Demography, Equity and the Future of San Diego.\"\n\nJennifer Ito, PERE Director\n\nMore recently, at PERE, researchers have been looking at the demographic shifts in Los Angeles and how that's affected social and economic equity. \"An Equity Profile of the Los Angeles Region,\" funded by the Weingart Foundation and PolicyLink, breaks down the numbers and illustrates where the biggest gaps in equity are. Knowing this information can help shape the county's future.\n\nWhat the profile found is enlightening and it often contradicts the perceptions that people have of Los Angeles. The summary of the \"Equity Profile\" explains that 73% of Los Angeles' population is comprised of people of color and that it will be majority Latino by 2020. But, what it also found was that the surge in population growth that happened in the 1980s hasn't continued to the present day.\n\nMoreover, what the profile reports is that, in recent years, the population of Asian Angelenos has increased by 22% and more than half of that growth has been through immigration. Meanwhile, the Latino Angeleno population has increased by 13% and that's primarily people of Latino heritage who were born in the U.S. All other groups, the profile says, have had declining population in the Los Angeles area.\n\nBut, the profile doesn't just look at ethnic demographics. It looks at economic ones too and that's where some of the misconceptions about Los Angeles are revealed. In truth, the profile shows, job growth in Los Angeles has been lagging since 1979 and, since 1990, poverty has been higher than average here. In fact, the profile notes, Los Angeles was found to have the 7th highest level of income inequality in the country and the report states that 18.4% of locals live below the poverty line.\n\nWhile there isn't just one cause for this, there is one that the report highlights: declining \"middle-wage jobs.\" There's been a significant decline in available work at this level. Meanwhile, low and high wage jobs have increased. With that in mind, you can see why the divide between the rich and the poor is growing.\n\nBut, there's more to it than just the number of available jobs. The \"Equity Profile\" also crunches the data to show how social and economic inequality by race, is impacted by the local job market. The report shows not only that African-American and Latino residents are more likely to live below the poverty line-- and that Latinos are more likely to be considered \"working poor-- than white residents, but that employment opportunities and wages aren't necessarily increasing with education levels. Moreover, the profile notes that women of color are earning less regardless of their education level.\n\nIto and the researchers at PERE pull the data so that policymakers and other big thinkers can figure out a way to build a better future.

One of his projects is CD 8 Clean and Safe Streets, a program designed to make more use of city services for maintaining the streets in the neighborhood.\n\nMarqueece Harris-Dawson, 8th District Councilmember\n\nLast March, Harris Dawson was part of a panel at the Weingart Foundation's \"Achieving Equity\" event in Los Angeles. There, he spoke about L.A.'s past, where money often funneled into the wealthier parts of town, leaving low-income areas without key resources. That changed, he says. But, he added, that's not how equity is achieved because not every neighborhood needs the same amount of funding for the same purpose. Data, he notes, can help the powers that be figure out who needs what and that can make a huge different in how the city continues to develop. \"Equity is a value on the one hand,\" he told the crowd, \"but, on the other, it is a practice.\"\n\nThis story was originally published on August 3, 2017.", "title": "L.A.'s Growing Economic Gap: A Need For Equity", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "['inequality']", "annot_city": "['Los Angeles']"}, {"id": 488, "city": "['Chicago']", "url": "https://news.wttw.com/2017/03/23/survey-reveals-alarming-health-disparities-chicago-neighborhoods", "text": "In Chicago\u2019s South Lawndale community, more than 40 percent of men and nearly 50 percent of women report being in fair or poor general health, according to a new study.\n\nThanks to our sponsors: View all sponsors\n\nNationally, that figure is about 12 percent.\n\nThose findings are among the many health disparities detailed in the Sinai Community Health Survey 2.0, which evaluated the health of more than 1,900 residents in nine Chicago neighborhoods.\n\nMaureen Benjamins, senior researcher at Sinai Urban Health Institute, said that while the findings surprised many researchers involved in the survey, not everyone reacted similarly.\n\n\u201cThe community health workers go into the field every day and go into people\u2019s homes, and say these findings confirm what they already knew,\u201d she said.\n\nResearchers conducted face-to-face interviews with residents of Chicago Lawn, Gage Park, Hermosa, Humboldt Park, North Lawndale, Norwood Park, South Lawndale, West Englewood and parts of West Town, where residents west of Western Avenue were surveyed.\n\n\u201cThe data paint a stark and complex picture of health and wellness in many Chicago communities, varied by race, income and ethnicity, demonstrating the value in collecting hyperlocal information,\u201d said Sharon Homan, president of the Sinai Urban Health Institute, in a statement.\n\nDrilling down to a community-level can reveal nuances in citywide health data, said Benjamins.\n\n\u201cThe city [smoking] level is 18 percent, so about one in five people in Chicago smoke. In the selected communities that we surveyed, that rate ranges from 6 percent to nearly 60 percent,\u201d Benjamins said.\n\nIn West Englewood, 56 percent of men and 47 percent of women smoke. \u201cThat would be an ideal place to focus our efforts\u201d to reduce smoking by providing resources in the community, she said.\n\nResidents were asked more than 500 questions that addressed traditional health measures such as general health status, obesity and post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nAccording to the survey, one in four women in Humboldt Park and North Lawndale currently have symptoms of PTSD, and at least one in 10 adults in Humboldt Park and the western side of West Town have been diagnosed with the disorder.\n\nJana Hirschtick, senior epidemiologist at Sinai Urban Health Institute, called the rates of PTSD \u201calarming.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were aware that this was an issue but not aware of the magnitude,\u201d she said.\n\nSurvey questions also touched on social factors that influence a person\u2019s health, including food insecurity, criminal justice experiences and unmet health care needs.\n\nAssessing social factors of health is \u201creally critical, and unfortunately, overlooked when we think of traditional health measures,\u201d said Hirschtick.\n\nSocial and behavioral factors have a larger impact on health than traditional measures, like clinical care, and shed light on differences in health between groups, she added. \u201cIt helps us understand and get to the why of why things are the way they are and why there are differences in groups.\u201d\n\nMany residents said that they forgo medical care, surgery, treatment, prescriptions and even eyeglasses due to costs. In Gage Park, one in six adults did not receive needed medical care or surgery in the past year due to the cost. Meanwhile, about one in four adults in West Englewood and North Lawndale did not get needed prescription medications in the past year because of cost.\n\nBenjamins said she was surprised by the prevalence of food insecurity\u2014or the limited availability or access to nutritionally adequate and safe foods\u2014among those surveyed.\n\nMore than 40 percent of households in Humboldt Park, South Lawndale and Gage Park were food insecure in the past year, compared to 13 percent of homes nationally, according to the study.\n\nCollecting the data and quantifying the experiences of residents are the first steps to creating meaningful programs and policies, says Hirschtick.\n\n\u201cThere are a constellation of factors that communities face that impact their health. It\u2019s not just PTSD, or food insecurity, or obesity,\u201d she said. \u201cDisadvantaged communities have a number of factors that impact people\u2019s daily lives and health.\n\n\u201cEach community is really unique in terms of the constellation of factors and the different people in them,\u201d she added. \u201cAnd when we think of solutions and translating the findings into solutions we need to tackle them neighborhood by neighborhood.\u201d\n\nNext month, SUHI will begin hosting community forums to share the data with residents and start working with community partners to develop solutions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re really hoping with the public release of this data it will serve as a call to action for people. I think a lot of the findings demand attention,\u201d Hirschtick said. \u201cThey were alarming to us even though people live them every day. We hope we can turn the findings into actionable results and we\u2019re actively looking for partners to do so.\u201d\n\nFor more information about the survey, visit the Sinai Community Health Survey website.\n\nFollow Kristen Thometz on Twitter: @kristenthometz\n\nRelated stories:\n\nEPA Cuts \u2018Matter of Life and Death\u2019 for Chicago Communities\n\nMarch 20: Cuts to the EPA\u2019s budget would affect a disproportionate number of minority and low-income residents in Chicago, experts say.\n\nRepublican Health Care Reform Bill Struggling\n\nMarch 15: As the Republican replacement for Obamacare faces political backlash, we take a closer look at how the law might change health coverage.\n\nNew City Medical Director to Focus on Mental Health, Addiction\n\nFeb. 1: The Chicago Department of Public Health recently hired a behavioral health medical director to better address substance use disorders and mental health issues in the city.

But roughly a decade earlier, there was no such disparity.\n\nPublic concern over the growing trend led to the creation of the Metropolitan Chicago Breast Cancer Task Force in 2008.\n\nThanks to our sponsors: View all sponsors\n\nAnne Marie Murphy, executive director of the task force, said the growth of the mortality disparity was \u201calarming.\u201d Community leaders, advocates, health care providers and breast cancer survivors who make up the task force have been working ever since to eliminate \u201cinequities in prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment and survivorship of all women,\u201d according to its mission statement.\n\nAfter nine years, a new study finds the task force is having an impact: An analysis of data collected from 2006-2013 shows that African-American women diagnosed with breast cancer were 39 percent more likely to die from the disease than their white counterparts.\n\n\u201cNow that 68 percent has come down to 39 percent. That\u2019s a huge difference,\u201d said Murphy. \u201cIt\u2019s a large drop and we\u2019re delighted about that. Obviously, we haven\u2019t gotten to zero like we\u2019d like to get to, but the needle is finally moving in the right direction.\u201d\n\nThe study compared nationwide breast cancer mortality rates with those in Chicago and nine other U.S. cities with populations of at least 500,000 and high numbers of African-American residents. Researchers compared figures for each city over two time periods: 1999-2005 and 2006-2013.\n\nFrom 1999-2005, the mortality disparity increased annually by 3.9 percent in Chicago, according to the study. But the trend was reversed from 2006-2013, when it decreased annually by 3.1 percent.\n\n\u201cChicago\u2019s collaborative efforts have shown that health disparities are not inevitable,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThey are not immutable. They can be overcome and health equity can be achieved.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe changes we\u2019ve seen are a reflection of the city\u2019s commitment to addressing health disparity,\u201d said Chicago Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Julie Morita. \u201cI think anytime we embark on a new effort to address health disparities we are concerned whether or not they\u2019ll be successful, which is why we\u2019re committed to doing studies like this one. ... It\u2019s critically important to monitor initiatives to make sure they\u2019re making a difference.\u201d\n\nMortality rates for breast cancer dropped nationally between 2006 and 2013, with greater declines for white women in all cities \u2013 except Chicago, where black women saw a decline of 13.8 percent, compared to 7.7 percent for white women.\n\n\u201cChicago leads the nation in reducing breast cancer deaths for African-American women,\u201d Murphy said \u201cThe task force is unique in that it took a comprehensive approach to this disparity. We really felt strongly one needed to do a comprehensive assessment and then take an evidence-based approach on the front end and gathered a lot data as to where the challenges are in Chicago.\u201d\n\nChicago\u2019s \u2018Comprehensive\u2019 Approach\n\nThe task force began its first project, the Chicago Breast Cancer Quality Consortium, with the mission of improving \u201cpatient safety and the quality of breast cancer screening and treatment by sharing data on quality measures for breast cancer screening and treatment and developing quality improvement projects based on analysis of this data.\u201d\n\nBased on the assessment of data collected from about 60 Chicago-area facilities and hospitals, the task force identified areas that could be improved within the health care delivery system, from diagnosis to treatment.\n\nIt found a wide variation in the quality of mammograms. \u201cThe notion that a mammogram is a mammogram is a mammogram is not true,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cResources are unevenly divided. Black women were less likely to have their mammograms read by a breast imaging specialist. They are more likely to have their mammograms read by a generalist.\u201d\n\nIn addition, the task force found a \u201cfractured\u201d health care system. \u201cWomen on the South Side have limited access to service facilities. They don\u2019t have a good pathway for comprehensive care,\u201d Murphy said.\n\n\u201cWe had a very systematic approach for assessing breast health systems and found a lot of variation in regard to how resources are readily available to women in different areas,\u201d she added. \u201cFor instance, if you\u2019re affluent in Chicago, you have a 40-percent chance of being proximal (within a mile) to a breast imaging center of excellence. If you\u2019re poor, there\u2019s a 1 percent chance of being proximal to a breast imaging center of excellence.\u201d\n\n\u201cChicago leads the nation in reducing breast cancer deaths for African-American women.\u201d\n\n\u2013Anne Marie Murphy\n\nIn its analysis, the task force also discovered that not all facilities have the ability to follow up with their patients. \u201cA lot of safety net facilities don\u2019t have a lot of phones, so they don\u2019t have the funding for navigators to follow up with their patients to get them back to care,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThose reminders and follow ups really matter.\u201d\n\nThat need led to the development of the task force\u2019s Beyond October and Extra Help, Extra Care navigation programs. Navigators help women schedule mammograms, remind them of upcoming appointments, help interpret results and help coordinate treatment if they\u2019re diagnosed with cancer.\n\n\u201cWe help women navigate the system because it\u2019s often complicated,\u201d Murphy said.\n\nThrough the Beyond October program, navigators help 1,500 women a year and reach 12,000 through outreach and educational programming, according to Murphy. (Women can fill out an application online to qualify for free mammogram screenings through the program.)\n\nAbout 200 women are helped each year through the task force\u2019s Extra Help, Extra Care program for those who receive abnormal mammogram results at a partnering facility or hospital.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve made $700,000 available to continue this type of work for free in African-American communities and making sure our navigation services are available if women have abnormal mammograms. It\u2019s not enough to know you have cancer. It\u2019s important for them to get the cure that they need,\u201d Morita said. \u201cWe are funding a number of groups and the Metropolitan Chicago Breast Cancer Task Force is one of them.\u201d\n\nOther interventions initiated by the task force include educating the public about the importance of breast cancer screenings, training technologists how to properly take and read mammograms, and conducting on-site assessments of facilities to close any gaps in diagnosis or treatment.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve done a lot of these interventions. Some have been very successful,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cWe think it\u2019s a wonderful model for other locations because it\u2019s something that definitely can be replicated.\u201d\n\nNote: This story was originally published July 21.\n\nFollow Kristen Thometz on Twitter: @kristenthometz\n\nRelated stories:\n\nSurvey Reveals \u2018Alarming\u2019 Health Disparities in Chicago Neighborhoods\n\nMarch 23: Several South and Southwest Side communities lag behind national health and wellness benchmarks, according to a new community health survey.\n\nNew Guidelines for Breast Cancer Screening\n\nOct. 26, 2015: The American Cancer Society has issued new guidelines for women at \"average risk\" of developing breast cancer, raising the age it says they should start regular mammogram screening from 40 to 45.

The percentage of respondents rating their health as poor or fair ranged from 28 in South Acres to 45 in Aldine.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t seem to improve a base of people\u2019s health, even though we\u2019ve strengthened the area\u2019s safety-net health clinics in the last decade,\u201d said Stephen Linder, the survey\u2019s principal investigator and director of the Institute for Health Policy at the UTHealth School of Public Health. \u201cIf we hadn\u2019t strengthened the safety net, it would be even worse.\u201d\n\nObesity, high blood pressure and diabetes were the most chronic health problems affecting county residents. Thirty-two percent meet the definition for obesity, 29 percent suffer from hypertension and 13 percent have diabetes, numbers that mask even higher rates in the disadvantaged areas. Gulfton\u2019s rate of diabetes was 21 percent, for instance, up from 15 percent in 2010.\n\nNineteen percent of respondents said they \u201csometimes\u201d had trouble just getting food in the last 12 months. More than 10 percent of black residents encountered such difficultly \u201cregularly\u201d and a quarter of both blacks and Hispanics encountered it \u201csometimes.\u201d\n\nKen Janda, a former Houston insurance company CEO who is now a consulting firm principal, said the report \u201chighlights something that should be obvious \u2014 health outcomes are strongly correlated with income. In order to improve the overall health of Texas and Houston in particular we have to improve access to healthy environments, activities and care for low-income populations.\u201d\n\nLinder began presenting survey findings to local health officials and community groups last month. A report on the survey, based on 2017 and 2018 telephone interviews in English and Spanish with 5,694 Harris County households, can be accessed online at www.healthofhouston.org.\n\nOn HoustonChronicle.com: Do you live in one of Houston\u2019s many food deserts?\n\nDr. Umair Shah, executive director of Harris County Public Health, praised the report for \u201chighlighting where things are happening\u201d and said it will allow the sprawling county to \u201cpinpoint interventions in areas most in need.\u201d He said the report \u201creally paints a picture that we have to do more to address problems at the community level.\u201d\n\nThe survey builds on a similar one Linder conducted in the Houston area in 2010, which pioneered the concept of gathering and analyzing data at the sub-county level, now increasingly being employed around the state and nation. Previously, the only sub-national and sub-state data was collected at the county level, which Shah emphasized isn\u2019t \u201calways that helpful in one with 4.7 million people and the size of Rhode Island.\u201d\n\n\u2018The hard part is not knowing\u2019\n\nAmong those in the county battling health issues is Sister Mama Sonya, whose doctors are struggling to determine the cause of abdominal pain that wasn\u2019t relieved by the removal earlier this year of a benign tumor near her pancreas. She has fibroids, but doctors don\u2019t think that\u2019s the issue.\n\n\u201cThe hard part is not knowing what the condition is,\u201d says Sonya, 63, who lives in the Third Ward, where nearly 1 in 4 people rate their health as poor or fair. \u201cI just want to know what it is, how to treat it.\u201d\n\nSonya, who used to consume lots of sugar and fast food but no longer does, also battles diabetes and the accompanying nerve pain in the extremities, which exacerbates the clinical depression she was diagnosed with years ago. She founded Sisters Controlling Diabetes, a support group for women of color with the condition, and wrote a book, \u201cSweet Sensations for the Spirit,\u201d a collection of conversations with diabetes patients.\n\nShe lost her insurance recently when she was laid off, but receives treatment through the Harris Health System, the county\u2019s safety-net hospital system.\n\nRelated: Survey finds Houstonian health worse than national average\n\nIn fact, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, fewer Harris County residents are uninsured now \u2014 27 percent of adults, down from to 31 percent in 2010; and 11 percent of children, down from 13 percent. Forty percent have no dental insurance, compared to 49 percent in 2010.\n\nBut closer analysis revealed continued cracks.\n\nFifty-six percent of Hispanics were uninsured, four times the rate of whites and roughly three times that of blacks and Asians. Linder said the primary reason for that is Hispanics disproportionately work in service industries, construction trades and small firms that provide no insurance to their employees. Undocumented Hispanics accounted for about six precent of the total.\n\nGeographically, rates varied from 7 percent to 56 percent, with the highest amounts in Pasadena, Galena Park, Gulton, Aldine and a southwest Houston area that includes part of Bellaire. The latter two had the highest percentage of residents both uninsured and unable to get needed care.\n\nIn Gulfton, lacking insurance, Diana Lopez would try to push through teeth pain, headaches and high blood pressure.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d faint sometimes, never sure why,\u201d says Lopez, who has matters under control now thanks to a local clinic that provides low-cost care, including sliding-scale rates. \u201cAnd I\u2019d bear any pain, try to blow it off, take over-the-counter medication. I just didn\u2019t have the money for insurance.\u201d\n\nOn HoustonChronicle.com: Census: Texas again leads nation in uninsured \u2014 by huge margin\n\nEven the big-picture insurance improvement was underwhelming to Dr. David Persse, the city of Houston health department\u2019s health authority. Noting the \u201cthousands of hours of effort\u201d by the health department to facilitate people signing up for coverage, he said \u201cthe all too small improvement\u201d was his biggest disappointment from the survey.\n\n\u201cThis hurts everyone,\u201d said Persse. \u201cCaring for persons without insurance still spends healthcare dollars, but in the most inefficient and ineffective ways. In addition, these inefficiencies serve to slow down the system as well as increase costs for all persons seeking health care regardless of their insurance status.\u201d\n\nPersse added that the lack of insurance has contributed to nights this summer when the majority of emergency centers across Houston have requested ambulance traffic be diverted elsewhere, \u201cunusual for this time of year.\u201d That\u2019s only likely to worsen during the coming flu season, he noted.\n\nSome positive numbers\n\nThere were some improvements since 2010: the percentage of mothers who\u2019ve ever breastfed rose from 82 to 89; the percentage of adults who met the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for physical activity rose from 47 to 59; the percentage of pregnant women receiving prenatal care in the first trimester rose from 84 to 92; and cancer screening rates improved \u2014 from 72 percent to 80 percent for breast cancer.\n\nThe county\u2019s HPV vaccination rate was also a positive. Forty-one percent of Harris County adolescents \u2014 47 percent of girls and 35 percent of boys \u2014 had received the full complement of shots. That\u2019s higher than the state \u2014 38 percent overall, including 42 percent of girls and 34 percent of boys.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nA new study bolsters evidence that soda taxes can reduce sales, but whether they influence health remains unclear.\n\nThe research found that Philadelphia's 2017 tax led to a 38 percent decline in sugary soda and diet drink sales that year, even when taking into account an increase in sales in neighboring towns.\n\nThe results echo previous studies in Philadelphia, Berkeley and other places that have imposed beverage taxes, although the sales decline was larger than in some previous research. Unlike studies in Berkeley and Mexico, nontaxed drink sales didn't increase during the study, \"suggesting consumers were not substituting with these drinks in Philadelphia,\" the researchers said.\n\nThe new results were published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Bloomberg Philanthropies, a charitable group that supports anti-obesity measures including soda taxes, paid for the study but otherwise had no role in the research.\n\nLet our news meet your inbox.

The beverage industry and many merchants have fought back, with court cases and ballot initiatives, with mixed success. Last year, Pennsylvania's highest court upheld Philadelphia's tax, which is levied on distributors.\n\nPhiladelphia's tax has generated more than $130 million that's paying for free preschool programs and other community services. The study has no data on beverage consumption or obesity rates, but lead author Dr. Christina Roberto of the University of Pennsylvania says the sales decline suggests Philadelphians are drinking less soda and is a promising sign.\n\n\"I think it's well on its way to accomplishing its goal\" of funding preschool programs and other city projects, said Roberto, an assistant professor of medical ethics and health policy. \"It has this side benefit of reducing purchasing of these unhealthy drinks. It's win-win news for public health.\"\n\nThe new results are based on sales at nearly 300 supermarkets, big box stores and pharmacies in Philadelphia and its Pennsylvania suburbs. The researchers also looked at Baltimore, which doesn't have a soda tax, for comparison purposes.\n\nThey tracked sales starting in January 2016, the year before the 1.5-cents-per-ounce tax was imposed, through December 2017. Per-ounce soda prices in Philadelphia increased by 1.56 cents at pharmacies, .87 cents at big box stories, and .65 cents at supermarkets. Sales volume decreased by 1.3 billion ounces in Philadelphia, or about 50 percent, but that dropped to 38 percent when counting a 308 million-per-ounce sales volume increase in bordering communities, where prices were nearly unchanged. Soda sales prices edged up and soda sales volume dipped slightly in Baltimore.\n\nDespite uncertainty over the potential health benefits, a journal editorial says there's enough supporting evidence \"to move forward with adoption of taxes while continuing to monitor outcomes.\" The editorial authors include Dr. James Krieger, a public health physician and executive director of Healthy Food America, an advocacy group that supports soda taxes and other measures aimed at curbing America's junk food habit.\n\nWilliam Dermody, a spokesman for the American Beverage Association, said the study conflicts with other evidence suggesting a bigger effect from cross-border shopping for untaxed drinks outside of Philadelphia. U.S. drink-makers are reducing sugar in their products and creating smaller bottles and cans \u2014 steps he said make more sense than taxes to help Americans cut their sugar intake.\n\nSoda taxes \"hurt working families, small local business and their employees,\" he said.", "title": "Soda sales in Philly dropped after tax on sugary drinks, study says", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Philadelphia']"}, {"id": 492, "city": "['Houston']", "url": "https://communityimpact.com/houston/lake-houston-humble-kingwood/city-county/2017/05/31/food-deserts-houston-lead-high-childhood-obesity-rates/", "text": "Paradise Smoothies serves fruit smoothies.\n\nLocal and statewide officials in the Greater Houston area are working to reduce childhood obesity\u2014a condition that could add billions to health care costs and affect the health of this generation of children as they become adults.\n\nAbout 34 percent of children 12 or older are considered at an unhealthy weight in the Greater Houston area, according to a survey by the University of Texas Public Health.\n\nThe high obesity rate has led to a rise in children with adult diseases, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol and joint pains, said Ann Barnes, chief medical officer at Legacy Community Health. Legacy is a network of full-service clinics across the Greater Houston area.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classifies people as overweight if their body mass index\u2014a calculation based on an individual\u2019s height and weight\u2014is between the 85th and 95th percentiles. A person whose BMI is above the 95th percentile is considered obese.\n\nHarris County officials are also looking for ways address the childhood obesity in low-income communities.\n\nWhile poor food choices and sedentary behavior are some of the primary contributors to childhood obesity, in lower socioeconomic areas, obesity has also been linked to food deserts, which are areas where a large number of residents are not within walking distance of a full-service grocery store, Barnes said.\n\nWhen combined with a lack of transportation options, some parents in low-income areas are forced to purchase their groceries from gas stations and drug stores, Barnes said. The areas usually also feature a high density of fast-food restaurants, she said. About 16 percent of Greater Houston area residents do not have access to fruits and vegetables, according to the survey by the UTPH.\n\n\u201cIf a neighborhood doesn\u2019t have easy access to a full-service grocery store or a farmers market, families have less access to foods that would promote healthy eating,\u201d Barnes said.\n\nHarris County is trying to solve childhood obesity by creating public-private partnerships like Healthy Living Matters that lobby for government support and purchasing green space for parks and trails that will allow for a encourage more active lifestyles.\n\n\u201cYou have to rely on people to take the initiative on their own families and households,\u201d Umair Shah, executive director for Harris County Public Health.\u201cBut ... a family doesn\u2019t make the decision to build a park near their home.\u201d\n\nFind out if the U.S. Department of Agriculture has deemed your neighborhood a food desert.", "title": "Food deserts in Houston lead to high childhood obesity rates", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "['food', 'health', 'children']", "annot_city": "['Houston']"}, {"id": 493, "city": "['Phoenix']", "url": "https://azbigmedia.com/business/consumer-news-news/new-frys-grocery-store-ends-food-desert-for-downtown-phoenix/", "text": "Downtown Phoenix is home to two professional sports teams, a university campus and scores of apartment complexes and condos.

Trump\u2019s Republican party has pushed to repeal the 2010 Obamacare program, which expanded health care to most uninsured Americans, while the liberal wing of the Democratic party has called for a federally funded, single-payer system, inspired by programs in Canada and many European countries.\n\nThe NYC Care plan, which de Blasio said would be funded without tax increases, is an expansion of the city\u2019s existing MetroPlus plan that covers hospital bills for low-income residents. The new plan provides insurance for visits to doctors outside of hospitals. Health experts say that access to regular medical visits can cut down on costly hospital stays.\n\nNYC Care, which will be launched in the Bronx borough in the summer of 2019, will expand across the entire city by 2021 and cost at least $100 million annually, according to a statement from the mayor\u2019s office.\n\nThe mayor said all services would be affordable on a sliding scale for those who are able to pay a portion of the costs, while those who cannot afford to pay will receive care for free.\n\nUnlike the MetroPlus plan, NYC Care is a program that leverages the city\u2019s hospital system.

The researchers report in the journal Nature Nov. 15 that Houston's risk for extreme flooding during the hurricane -- a category 4 storm that caused an estimated $125 billion in damage and killed 68 people -- was 21 times greater due to urbanization.\n\nUsing computer models and weather data, the researchers recreated Hurricane Harvey and compared the total rainfall with urban buildup to total rainfall without urban buildup. The results indicate that human-made development helped create a wetter hurricane -- one that dropped 40 to 60 inches of rain over four days -- as well as more serious flooding, with higher flood peaks and greater overall damage.\n\nThe results highlight the human role in extreme weather events, as well as the need to consider urban and suburban development when calculating hurricane risk and preparing for hurricane damage and recovery, the authors said. The study also accentuates the need to understand the compounded human impact on rainfall and flooding caused by urbanization and climate change.\n\n\"Our focus on the role of urbanization was aimed at providing a fuller perspective of human activities on Harvey's rainfall and flooding,\" said co-author Gabriel Vecchi, a Princeton professor of geosciences and the Princeton Environmental Institute (PEI). \"Humans have influenced both climate, through greenhouse gas emissions, and the local environment around Houston through urbanization in ways that we thought could have affected rainfall and flooding from Harvey.\"\n\nThe researchers found that as Houston's urban center grew upward and outward, flood risk changed, including a greater risk of higher flood peaks and more serious and dangerous flooding overall. As the city's miles of impervious sidewalks and streets increased, heavy rainfall could not be absorbed into the ground.\n\n\"Given that hurricane winds and rainfall are projected to intensify in the future, and that urbanization along our coasts is also expected to continue to increase, our work highlights the need to understand the risks and to implement appropriate flood-mitigation strategies,\" said lead author Wei Zhang, an assistant research scientist at Iowa's IIHR -- Hydroscience and Engineering research center.\n\nadvertisement\n\nMuch of the scientific analysis that followed the 2017 hurricane season focused on the role of climate -- including the overall warming of the planet -- in determining a hurricane's physical strength and total amount of rainfall. The Princeton and Iowa researchers decided to take a different, but complementary, tack and looked at urbanization's possible role.\n\n\"Hurricane Havey's impacts on Houston highlight hazards to coastal cities along the Gulf Coast and Eastern Seaboard of the United States,\" said co-author James Smith, a Princeton professor of civil and environmental engineering and PEI associated faculty. \"An unfortunate repeat performance from Hurricane Florence this year underscores the problems of extreme tropical cyclone rainfall in urban settings.\"\n\nThe researchers experimented with different computer models to simulate Hurricane Harvey's rainfall in Houston, first looking at total rainfall with the city's current urban profile, then at rainfall for the same geographic area but with open fields and crops in place of streets and skyscrapers. They found that the non-urban areas received significantly less rainfall, and that rainfall patterns were significantly different than in the urban areas.\n\nThe reason was that \"surface roughness\" due to the presence of human-made structures create a \"drag effect\" on hurricanes. This effect occurs when high winds strike tall buildings, creating friction. In the case of Hurricane Harvey, winds shifted warm surface air farther up into the atmosphere, thereby creating an optimal situation for cloud formation and precipitation.\n\n\"When Hurricane Harvey blew into Houston, it literally got snagged on the city's tall skyscrapers and towers,\" said Gabriele Villarini, associate professor of civil and environmental engineering and director of IIHR. \"The friction caused by high winds buffeting tall buildings created a drag effect that influenced air and heat movement and resulted in optimal conditions for precipitation.\"\n\nUsing statistical models, the researchers also looked at year-over-year changes in flood peaks and compared them to rainfall amounts and population growth, a proxy for urbanization. They compared these results to flood peaks from the 1950s, a period that predates urban development in Houston, and again found a positive correlation between urban growth and increased flood risk.\n\n\"Urbanization is generally associated with a significant reduction in storm-water infiltration,\" Villarini said. \"Houston has experienced one of the most impressive urban-development booms in U.S. history, and with growth comes an increase in impervious surfaces. This increase in urbanization, combined with the region's flat clay terrain, represents a very problematic mix, even with flood-mitigation measures in place.\"\n\nThe researchers caution that failure to account for urban factors in terms of hurricane preparation could present serious and costly problems for coastal cities.\n\n\"While this research can't be extrapolated to every coastal urban area in the nation, it does highlight the unexpected costs of development,\" Villarini said. \"For every new roadway poured and for every new high-rise erected, there is an increased risk for more adverse rainfall and flooding, and that's certainly something that city officials and residents should consider when they contemplate future growth.\"", "title": "Houston's urban sprawl increased rainfall, flooding during Hurricane Harvey", "dataset": "manual_google", "labels": "[]", "annot_city": "['Houston']"}, {"id": 500, "city": "['San Francisco']", "url": "https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Here-s-why-you-should-be-biking-to-work-for-San-11136716.php", "text": "Here's why you should be biking to work for San Francisco Bike to Work Day and every day\n\nMeghan Arnold rides along the protected bike lane on Polk Street during Bike to Work Day 2014.

Check the coalition's site for more events and info.\n\nBusiness Insider took a look at some of the main reasons to bike to work every day, not just Thursday. Check them out, and check out some of our favorite crazy bikes in the gallery above.\n\nResolving to save money, get healthy, or cut your carbon footprint? You could hit all three by simply riding your bike to work.\n\nNot only does biking have the potential to improve individuals' health, wealth, and standard of living, but the combination of more cyclists and fewer cars on the road could give the entire country a much-needed boost.\n\nHere are 13 reasons you should consider making biking to work a new habit in the new year:\n\nIt would make cycling safer for everyone.\n\nResearch shows that unlike cars, the more bicycles on the road, the safer it becomes for cyclists.\n\n\"It's a virtuous cycle,\" Dr. Julie Hatfield, an injury expert from the University of New South Wales, says. \"The likelihood that an individual cyclist will be struck by a motorist falls with increasing rate of bicycling in a community. And the safer cycling is perceived to be, the more people are prepared to cycle.\"\n\nIt is vastly cheaper than driving.\n\nDue to rising fuel costs and tire upkeep, the cost of owning a car increased nearly 2% in 2012 to $8,946, according to AAA.\n\nIt costs just $308 per year to keep bikes in shape \u2014 nearly 30 times less than cars, according to the Sierra Club. It says: \"If American drivers were to make just one four-mile round trip each week with a bicycle instead of a car, they would save nearly 2 billion gallons of gas. At $4 per gallon, total savings would be $7.3 billion a year.\"\n\nIt's a free gym on wheels.\n\nOn average, bicycle commuters lose 13 pounds in their first year of cycling alone.\n\n\"[Bike commuting] can be a very effective cardiovascular benefit,\" says Lisa Callahan, MD, of the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City. \"If you're overweight and start an exercise program, sometimes it's harder on your joints because you are overweight, so something like swimming or biking that's not pounding on the joints can be a good thing.\"\n\nYou won't miss morning traffic jams.\n\nAmericans spend upwards of 25 minutes per day commuting to work and more than $700 per year simply burning fumes in traffic\n\nCycling could help you get there faster for a lot less.\n\n\"Half of the working population in the U.S. commutes five miles or less to work, with bike trips of three to five miles taking less time or the same amount of time as commuting by car,\" writes Kiplinger editor Amanda Lilly.\n\nYou don't even have to own a bike.\n\nThere's been a wave of new bike share programs in major cities like Washington, D.C., Boston, Chicago, and Miami, which typically allow riders 30 to 45 minutes of transportation for a small annual fee.\n\nWhen New York City's bike share launched in May, annual memberships cost $95 \u2014 about $10 less than subway commuters spend per month.\n\nWomen could use the extra bone support.\n\nAs women age, they become increasingly susceptible to bone deterioration through osteoporosis.\n\nA team of researchers from a Swedish university found middle-aged women were less likely to sustain wrist fractures if they commuted by bike or participated in other physical activities like walking.\n\nWe could save hundreds of millions on health care expenses.\n\n\"The most important socio-economic impact of cycling lies in the area of health care,\" says Andy Clarke, president of the League of American Bicyclists.\n\nNowhere is that more clear than in Portland, Ore. A study published in the Journal of Physical Activity and Health found that \"during the next 30 years, Portland\u2019s residents could save as much as $594 million in health care costs because of an investment into biking culture\" and \"fuel savings of $143 to $218 million.\"\n\nYou inhale more harmful exhaust in your car than on a bike.\n\nThough fuel emissions are bad news in general, drivers are actually more susceptible to harmful air than bicyclists.\n\n\"Studies show you get the biggest hit of the nasties when you\u2019re inside a car,\" notes the Grist's Umbra Frisk. \"Sure, a personal Mobile Emissions Source [cars, for example] appears hermetic, but it\u2019s an illusion: MES occupants are very close to sucking on the tailpipe of the MES just ahead of them. In a bus, riders\u2019 lungs are a bit above these sources. And bikers and pedestrians are on the outskirts.\"\n\nYou're way more likely to get sick taking public transportation.\n\nFresh air does a body good. A study by the University of Nottingham found that public transit riders were \"six times more likely to suffer from acute respiratory infections,\" the New York Daily News reports.\n\nSupposedly, occasional riders were even more at risk.

So coach Chaka Daley tried to engineer as many challenges as possible. Most exhibition matches for power conference teams are designed blowouts against far-inferior teams. Not for the 24th-ranked Wolverines, though. They played on the road at Cincinnati and Akron, both moves designed with upcoming games in mind. The Bearcats field is turf like Omaha s, one of Michigan s September opponents. A mid-August day in southern Ohio is going to be hot, adding another layer of challenge. The Zips made the College Cup last year and return 10 of 11 starters, perfect practice for a team that plays in a conference with the other three College Cup finalists Michigan State, Indiana and Maryland and also has a matchup with Notre Dame, the squad that eliminated it in the NCAA Tournament last year. Michigan split the exhibition matches, winning 2-1 against Cincinnati and losing 3-2 against Akron. Very tactical in our approach to games, in the out of conference, certainly to play on the road, I think, was important for us, Daley said. So that s why we played both of those games on the road. I knew it would be hot and I think that's also a training situation, so environment, temperature, facility, the ground that you play on, all those things were very tactical, and Akron was simply, 10 of their 11 were returning from a team that went to the national final and I think if our group is to have ambition of equaling or doing better than what we did last year, we need to compete against teams like Akron and we want to see where we stood in the big picture early on. Daley wasn t disappointed with the loss, though. Neither team was at full strength, with players out injured or simply resting. And as an exhibition, it was less a must-win game and more a chance to try out new players and combinations after losing six starters from last year. Forward Nebojsa Popovic, an Oakland transfer whom Daley believes will factor into the rotation this season, started both games and scored one of the goals against the Zips. Along with Popovic, Daley believes forwards Derick Broche, a redshirt freshman who sat out 2018 with an injury and freshmen Christian Pulselli and Inaki Rodriguez, will add to the attacking depth joining top 2018 scorers, senior Jack Hallahan and junior Umar Farouk Osman. Hallahan scored the second goal against Akron. But perhaps the position most in flux is goalkeeper. Henry Mashburn, who started the last 28 games in goal for the Wolverines dating back to 2017, simply decided not to play this year, leaving two untested goalkeepers senior Andrew Verdi and freshman Owen Finnerty to take the reins. A big thing for our whole team, is we ve been very big in the offseason of continuing to grow our depth in all of our positions, Daley said. So that, end of year last year we had several players injured going to the NCAA Tournament which really, for lack of better terms, hamstrung us going into the tournament and we were, we still fought hard against Notre Dame and gave ourselves a real chance to win the game ... but certainly our lack of depth was, became a little bit of our issue at the end of the season. And while we're creating depth at the goalkeeping position, we're creating depth at all positions. It s not just about figuring out who is going to play. It s about chemistry and about trying different combinations of players to see who fits the puzzle. And though Daley says he still doesn t have everything quite figured out, he enjoys the challenge of putting the pieces together. It freshens him up. The Wolverines have a gauntlet of a schedule this year, playing four ranked teams and two other that received votes. But for now, Daley isn t focused on that. Instead, he s locked into the task at hand the season opener against Florida Gulf Coast on Friday and continuing to perfect the new look of a young team. We re still very young, we re still growing, and we re learning, because leadership lost, obviously, is not something you can obtain in 12 days preseason, Daley said. That s something that happened over many, many years for the past leaders within our group. Now we need to tighten up our mentality and our game management, and when I say game management, that's goal up, goal down, time and score, those kind of things, so we need to tighten up some of those things along with just continuing to get better and integrate the new players into the group and see if they can help with the depth.

Huawei s chief legal officer, Song Liuping, said Wednesday that Huawei filed a motion asking a court in Plano, Texas, for a summary judgment on whether a U.S. military spending provision that bars the government and its contractors from using Huawei equipment is constitutional. The lawsuit comes as the U.S. and China are embroiled in a broader trade war in which both sides have imposed billions of dollars of punitive tariffs against each other s products. Chinese state media suggested Wednesday that the country s rich supply of rare earths key elements for high-tech manufacturing - could be used as leverage against the U.S. in the dispute. Huawei is the biggest global maker of network equipment and enjoys a lead in 5G, or fifth-generation, technology. It also is the No. 2 maker of smartphones. The Trump administration says the company could use its equipment to spy on behalf of the Chinese government and is thus a threat to international cybersecurity. This decision threatens to harm our customers in over 170 countries, including more than 3 billion customers who use Huawei products and services around the world, Song said at a news briefing. Huawei, whose U.S. headquarters is in Plano, launched a lawsuit in March against the U.S. national defense law, calling the provision a bill of attainder that selectively punishes Huawei and violates its due process by presuming its guilt without a fair trial. The summary judgment motion seeks to accelerate the legal process to give U.S. customers access to Huawei equipment sooner, Huawei said in a statement. Song said the state-sanctioned campaign against the company will not improve cybersecurity. Politicians in the U.S. are using the strength of an entire nation to come after a private company, he said. This is not normal. Apart from the defense law provision, the U.S. Commerce Department recently placed Huawei on its Entity List, effectively barring U.S. companies from selling their technology to it and other Chinese firms without government approval. Huawei relies heavily on U.S. components, including computer chips, and about one-third of its suppliers are American. The dispute centers on China s longstanding huge trade surplus with the U.S. and complaints that Beijing and Chinese companies use unfair tactics to acquire advanced foreign technologies. The most recent round of negotiations between Beijing and Washington ended earlier this month without an agreement after Trump more than doubled duties on 200 billion in Chinese products. China responded by raising tariffs of 5 to 25 on 60 billion worth of American goods. At least three Chinese state media outlets on Wednesday suggested the country s supply of rare earths could be used as a weapon. People s Daily, the official newspaper of the ruling Communist Party, said in an editorial that the U.S. is a major buyer of China s rare earth materials and highly dependent on such resources. The editorial was titled The U.S. should not underestimate China s ability to enact countermeasures. Rare earths are chemical elements that are crucial to many modern technologies, such as consumer electronics. Chinese President Xi Jinping visited rare earth-related businesses in southeastern Jiangxi province earlier this month. He called rare earths an important strategic resource while stressing the importance of owning independent core technologies, the state-run China Daily reported. As a weapon, the nationalistic Global Times said, rare earths convey that China will not succumb to U.S. pressure. If the U.S. does not exercise restraint, it will see that China is far from running out of cards, and we have the will and determination to fight the U.S. to the end, the editorial said. An official of China s top economic planning agency did not rule out using rare earths as a countermeasure against the U.S. s unwarranted suppression. The actions against Huawei have already affected the company s U.S. partnerships. Google said it would continue to support existing Huawei smartphones, but future devices won t include its flagship apps and services, including maps, Gmail and search - a change that will likely make Huawei phones less appealing. Song said the U.S. has not provided any evidence to show that Huawei is a security threat. There is no gun, no smoke, only speculation, he said, accusing the U.S. of setting a dangerous precedent. Today it s telecoms and Huawei, he said. Tomorrow it could be your industry, your company, your consumers. Song said Huawei was asking FedEx about four packages containing paperwork that were found to have been diverted to FedEx headquarters in the U.S. instead of being delivered to Huawei offices in Asia. FedEx apologized and said the packages were misrouted accidentally. It said the company wasn t told by anyone to divert the packages. Song said Huawei was aware of FedEx s apology over the incident. But the company has questioned if the diversions were purely accidental. I don t think it is right for any company to intercept or detain individual documents or information. If our rights were truly infringed upon, we have the legal rights to defend ourselves, he said.

Vighter cybersecurity According to FBI crime reporting, cybercrime resulted in over 2.7 billion in damages nationwide this year an annual increase of more than 1.3 billion. Few small to medium businesses and government agencies have proactive defenses in place to protect themselves against emerging cyberthreats despite the fact that 43 of cyber-attacks target small business and 60 of those attacked are unable to continue operations 6 months later. As organizations continue to be attacked by cybercriminals it is clear there is a need for an effective cybersecurity solution which prevents attacks before they happen , said Jeremy Calvert, COO of Vighter. With the incorporation of Trust Lockdown into Vighter's cybersecurity service offerings the company hopes to simplify cybersecurity for small organizations and agencies through a product that efficiently manages untrusted programs while stopping 100 of ransomware and malware. The nature of cyberattacks is constantly evolving and reliance upon reactive antivirus technology leaves organizations vulnerable to zero-day attacks. Trust Lockdown technology was built from the ground up to address these weaknesses and to proactively block untrusted code by default. Most antivirus programs won't identify the threats until hours later, meanwhile your organization may have already been compromised. Trust Lockdown operates differently, if an app isn't trusted, it won't run. Period. With Trust Lockdown, your organization will be backed by security that prevents ransomware and wiper attacks, prevents fully undetectable malware FUD , prevents zero-day malware infections, prevents AWL Hash Collisions spoofing, eliminates remediation work by IT staff and offers unique protection again malicious insiders.

AP The American Library Association asked the public for help Wednesday to press Macmillan Publishers to rethink NASHVILLE, Tenn. AP The American Library Association asked the public for help Wednesday to press Macmillan Publishers to rethink a planned embargo on electronic copies of new releases to public libraries. The publishing house recently announced that beginning on Nov. 1 it will allow library systems to purchase only a single electronic copy of its new releases during the first eight weeks after publication. Some of those systems serve millions of patrons. In a letter announcing the policy, Macmillan Chief Executive John Sargent said e-book library lending is growing rapidly and hurting sales. It seems that given a choice between a purchase of an ebook for 12.99 or a frictionless lend for free, the American ebook reader is starting to lean heavily toward free, Sargent wrote. Macmillan is one of the largest book publishers operating in the U.S. Sargent did not respond to an email from The Associated Press requesting an interview. Library Association Executive Director Mary Ghikas announced the campaign to pressure Macmillan during the Digital Book World conference in Nashville. The organization is asking readers to sign a petition at ebooksforall.org . They are also promoting the campaign at local libraries. The association worked with the biggest U.S. publishers over the last decade to broker e-book agreements that both parties could accept, said Alan Inouye, senior director of public policy and government relations. Libraries pay a premium for e-books and, while agreements vary between publishers, most of those digital copies come with an expiration date. After two years or a certain number of checkouts, libraries often have to repurchase the e-books if they want to keep them in circulation, he said. Ghikas said libraries have had lingering concerns about the agreements, but the embargo represents the greatest threat. Libraries serve the local needs of their communities, Ghikas said. Macmillan s embargo will make that impossible. Speaking at the announcement, Nashville Public Library Director Kent Oliver offered some examples. Libraries have to pay 55 for a digital copy of Margaret Atwood s much anticipated new book The Testaments, while the retail price is 14.99, he said. The Nashville library tries to buy enough copies of popular new releases that patrons have to wait no more than 3.5 months to read them. For Delia Owens Where the Crawdads Sing, which came out last year, that meant purchasing 358 digital copies. There are still around 2,000 people on the waiting list. Nashville s library system spent nearly 700,000 on e-books alone last fiscal year, Oliver said, but they are willing to pay because providing unfettered, undiscriminating access to reading is the core of our work.

When 34 people were killed in a fire early Labor Day morning aboard the diving boat Conception, investigators quickly concluded that all six crew members were asleep and that there was no roving watch during those critical hours when passengers were asleep below deck. But now, there are growing questions about whether the operator of the Conception regularly had roving watches on its boats. The dive boat fire. Santa Barbara County Fire Department Advertisement In interviews with The Times, two former captains for Truth Aquatics which owns both the Conception and its sister boats, the Vision and Truth said that when they operated the company s boats they didn t have formal roving watch schedules even though they were required by Coast Guard regulations. The Coast Guard required the watches as part of its inspection certification. Don Rowell, a Truth captain from 2001 to 2008, said he would stay up all night during bad weather but didn t designate someone as the roving watch. It s a regulation, but it wasn t really followed, Rowell said. I don t know if you d call it a problem or not it s something that everyone should have and will have from now on out. James Hrabak, a Vision captain from 2001 to 2003 and now a relief captain, said his crew regularly checked the boat at night but did not have a formal night watch. Advertisement I did not say, Richard, you are going to take watch for four hours, he said. Truth Aquatics owner Glen Fritzler gave captains the power and full autonomy to run the boats as they want, he added. He allows captains to do as they will, said Hrabak, currently a senior patrol officer with the Channel Islands Harbor. It was almost like they leased the boats instead of running the boat for Truth Aquatics. Fritzler, through his attorney, declined to comment. In the days after the fire, a statement from an attorney representing Truth Aquatics said a crew member had checked the area where the fire broke out about a half-hour earlier and found nothing unusual. The Conception. Ventura County Fire Department The fire is now the subject of a criminal investigation by the Coast Guard and FBI that s overseen by the U.S. Attorney s office, in addition to probes by the National Transportation Safety Board and the Coast Guard Marine Board of Investigation. A preliminary investigation by the NTSB found that five crew members were sleeping in berths behind the wheelhouse when the fire broke out. By the time crew members woke and jumped down to the main deck, they found the galley and salon engulfed in flames. The main bunk room where their 33 customers and a fellow crew member dozed lay directly below, in the belly of the boat. The only way out was through the inferno. No one made that escape. Officials have said the purpose of having a night watch is to detect dangers such as fires early. With so many people tightly packed in a wooden and fiberglass vessel, at the whims of the ocean and wind, situations can turn dire in an instant. Advertisement In recent weeks, The Times interviewed Truth Aquatics crew members and associates who took numerous trips on the company s boats going back years. Most defended the company s safety record and said they believe crew members worked tirelessly to keep passengers safe. But several said they knew of no formal roving watch or that they could not recall it being a part of boat operations. One said they believe there was a roving watch on the Truth Aquatics vessel they worked on. Hrabak last captained the Vision in November 2018. Federal investigators, he said, recently asked how the vessels and company operated. Hrabak said he told investigators he knew Jerry Boylan, the Conception captain, for a long, long time and considered him as fine a skipper of a boat in the industry. He recalled an agent s reply Then why didn t he run a roving watch. Boylan could not be reached for comment. Conception, the boat that caught fire off Channel Islands. Truth Aquatics When Hrabak operated the Vision, the crew would be up at all hours and would walk all the decks when they got up to go to the bathroom, and passengers would do the same, he said. Still, the regulations for a roving watch are clear and not a captain s discretion, he said. He believes the lack of a roving watch is a widespread problem in the boating industry because few incidents occur when boats are anchored at night. Advertisement How did we get so far away from that. Hrabak said. We have fallen into complacency. We are not invincible. We never thought this could happen, and then this happened. Hrabak called Truth Aquatics a great company and said Fritzler took care of his crew and spared no expense on the boats, taking thousands of divers on trips. But he said he will operate differently once he s back at the helm. Hrabak is scheduled to captain a dive trip in March with Truth Aquatics and said he would designate a roving watch, even if it requires additional crew members. Lots of things are going to be different, he said. Chris Connolly worked as a crew member and captain of the Vision in the 1990s and said he did not remember whether someone was designated as a roving watch. The boats are small enough so that crew members could monitor them without moving around and waking passengers, he said. Somebody every couple of minutes is getting up to go to the bathroom and the same thing with the crew upstairs in the wheelhouse, he said. I just know it seems there was always somebody awake on the boat. He added There s a fine line between roving around and making noise and monitoring. Ralph Clevenger, who ran an underwater photography class on Truth Aquatics boats for more than a decade, said he had never heard crews or passengers mention roving watches during any excursion. I know about roving night watchman because I ve been on much bigger ships, he said. I had never heard about it relative to dive boats. Don Barthelmess, who taught diving at Santa Barbara City College for decades and is friends with Fritzler, recalled crew members up moving around the deck and checking on things. Speaking generally about dive boat operations, he said it s typical for a crew member to take a break from roving a ship on overnight dive trips. There s people staying up late at night, checking on anchors, checking things, but if someone lays down in their bunk, there s nobody to police that, he said. It s never been an issue everybody does it. In the weeks after the deadly Conception fire, Coast Guard inspectors across the country scurried to inspect small vessels that accommodate overnight passengers. Captains told The Times that inspectors asked them to make voluntary safety improvements for fire protection, escape hatches, emergency signs and updating policies for a roving watch. Carl Mayhugh, captain and owner of the 65-foot Magician dive boat in Ventura County, said he installed an electronic device in the galley that a crew member on roving watch must punch every 15 minutes or an alarm will go off. Mayhugh said he has the only key to turn it off. Those types of systems, he said, have always been standard on larger vessels to ensure the crew meets requirements. The Truth Aquatics vessel Truth is a sister ship of the Conception. Patrick T. Fallon For The Times It is a horrific-sounding alarm, Mayhugh said. It was 140 for peace of mind. Jason Barrow, owner and captain of the 68-foot Island Diver in Panama City, Fla., said it s common knowledge among the crew what is expected of the roving watch. Still, Coast Guard inspectors reviewed his book of procedures and asked him to write a detailed policy to explain the duties of a roving watch, Barrow said. It was just general knowledge for us that it was a standard operating procedure, he said. One person absolutely has to be up and roving. Capt. Joe Chait, who owns the 65-foot fishing charter Pegasus in San Diego, said the Conception disaster should be a wakeup call for the boat industry about the importance of night watches. There is a reason why that is listed in federal regulations, Chait told The Times. It s listed in the certificate of inspection. It s required. It boils down to nobody was awake. The industry was devastated.

On Friday, a Deposit man was sentenced to 10 years in prison for his role in the crime. Tyler DeCamp, 27, stabbed two men during the fight, but during his Broome County Court trial in May, he claimed he had been defending a friend. The two victims felt they were being ripped off for 500 worth of meth. A jury found DeCamp guilty of two first-degree assault felony counts, along with a felony tampering with evidence charge and a misdemeanor count of resisting arrest. He was found not guilty of more serious attempted murder charges. Johnson City police said the stabbings happened at the McDonald's at 339 Main St. happened Dec. 20, 2018 around 10 30 p.m., and the incident was initially reported as a fight. Broome County Court Judge Kevin Dooley said Friday it was clear, based on video evidence used in the trial, that DeCamp and another defendant pulled out knives and stabbed the victims while the two groups were fighting. This was building up, Dooley said of the incident. The victims, ages 32 and 35, were treated at UHS Wilson Medical Center Johnson City for what police described as serious wounds. DeCamp was among five people to face charges after the fight the status of the other cases weren't immediately available. Given a chance to speak at Friday's sentencing, DeCamp said he'd been worried about a different outcome if he hadn't intervened. He told the judge, I m not a violent person. Defense lawyer Veronica Gorman described her client's past struggles with drug addiction and noted this was his first felony conviction, in a pitch for a lenient sentence. A five-year post-release supervision term follows the 10-year prison sentence. The defense expects to appeal DeCamp's conviction.

It's Castor vs. Straz for the Tampa mayoral seat. Jane Castor collected 48.1 percent of vote David Straz collected 15.5 percent of vote Runoff scheduled for April 23 Click HERE for other Tampa Election Results The race has been whittled down from seven candidates to former Tampa Police Chief Jane Castor and billionaire philanthropist David Straz. Castor and Straz will head to the April 23 runoff in the race to be next mayor. Castor, the front runner going into Election Day, earned 48.1 percent of the vote, which was just shy of the 50 percent threshold necessary to avoid a runoff. Castor won all but two of the city's precincts. Coming in second was Straz, who collected 15.5 percent of the vote. Harry Cohen placed third with 12.2 percent of the vote, followed by Ed Turanchik 8.9 percent , Dick Greco, Jr. 8.6 percent , Mike Suarez 5.1 percent and Topher Morrison 1.7 percent . Straz promised supporters that, if he's elected, he'd perform a full audit of the City of Tampa budget, create higher paying jobs and deliver a world class transit system. Despite not being the favorite, Straz says he is confident he can compete. I have lived the American dream, Straz said Tuesday night. And I want to help every man, woman and child in Tampa do the same thing. And It starts by taking my broom to City Hall. Castor, meanwhile, is touting her experience as police chief to her supporters. She said she wants Tampa to be a national innovation leader, while at the same time growing local, home-bred businesses. Tampa's continued success requires an effective leader who can get things done, Castor said Tuesday night with celebrating constituents. And I am the individual with that knowledge, that skill and that experience to take Tampa successfully into the future. Castor kicked off the second round of campaigning Wednesday with an endorsement from the current mayor of Tampa. Bob Buckhorn said she was the only one in the race who was equipped to lead the city.

Addis made the announcement at the SLO County Progressives meeting in San Luis Obispo on Thursday evening. I have been active and engaged in our local issues and encouraging other people to use their voices and run for office, she said by phone earlier in the day. It s important to me to lead by example. Addis, who worked as a special education instructor for the San Luis Coastal Unified School District for more than a decade and currently works for the district as an English language educator, was elected to the Morro Bay City Council in November 2018, when she had the endorsement of the Democratic Party of San Luis Obispo County.

GET OFFER The 35th Assembly District encompasses San Luis Obispo and northern Santa Barbara counties. It has been represented in Sacramento since 2016 by Jordan Cunningham, a Templeton attorney and former member of the Templeton Unified School District board of trustees. Addis shares her mission On Thursday afternoon, Addis declined to go into detail about what she sees as the Central Coast s most important issues at the state level, but she said she feels the region s voices are not being heard in Sacramento and the Central Coast needs a leader who is off the sidelines and ready to make an actual difference. I believe I can make a true difference in the lives of the people of the Central Coast, she said. I m ready to bring the importance of the Central Coast to Sacramento as the true asset it is to the state . Asked about her roughly yearlong experience serving on the Morro Bay council, Addis said she s learned that leaders have to be willing to stick our necks out to get things done. Dawn Addis, left, shakes hands with supporter Amanda Tompkins at the Guild Hall in San Luis Obispo, where she announced her Assembly candidacy on Thursday. She will challenge incumbent Jordan Cunningham. Laura Dickinson Cunningham, who s made headlines as a lawmaker focused largely on public safety and consumer privacy issues, has also taken heat from his own political party for championing issues normally associated with Democrats, such as cap-and-trade, renewable energy and police transparency. Asked for criticism of Cunningham s work in office, Addis declined to go into details, saying instead that she s focused on the people of the Central Coast. In response to a request for comment Thursday, Cunningham s campaign released a statement saying the incumbent legislator has been an independent and bipartisan fighter for the Central Coast. We are confident that the voters will continue to recognize his efforts to fight human trafficking, fund career technical education, and fight for jobs and infrastructure here on a the Central Coast, the statement reads. Late announcement The timing of her announcement late in the campaign could present a problem for Addis campaign, namely in terms of endorsements from statewide associations. Cunningham already boasts a number of important endorsements, including from the California Teachers Association, according to its website. Addis said her campaign will move forward by reaching out to groups whose missions align with the Central Coast. According to state records, Cunningham s campaign committee has roughly 205,000 on hand. Secretary of State records on Thursday showed that Addis has created a campaign committee to begin fundraising, but it had no funds reported. She s also formed a campaign team she described as ready to win. I m going to do the things that I ve always done take a broad view, think about the people s needs, and think about the things we can be effective with for changing lives for the better, she said.

Very clear, very graphic and very insulting. It was meant to shock, it wasn t something subtle, Latimer told CBS2. For this to be the site of an act of hatred is particularly heinous, and for it to happen on the day which is the most solemn day on the Jewish calendar is really a statement being made by the person who did this.

More than 74 years ago the entire world reeled in shock, horror and sorrow over the senseless murder of more than six million Jews mothers, fathers, children, grandparents, uncles, aunts, friends and neighbors. Vandalizing a memorial lovingly built in their honor is a revolting and cowardly act, and I have directed the State Police Hate Crimes Task Force to offer assistance to local authorities investigating this heinous act to ensure those responsible are held accountable. On this day of atonement, I join with New York s Jewish community in remembrance of the lives lost and I pray for love, peace and understanding. Hate has no place in this state. The memorial was built in 1990 by the Holocaust and Human Rights Education Center and can be found outside the Michaelian Office Building on Martine Avenue. Antisemitism is rising in Westchester County, New York State, the county and in the world, and I am very upset to be here today about this, said Executive Director Millie Jasper.

So she messaged a friend to tell her she should check them out. And then yesterday, I was at work and she messaged me, Sanchez recalls. And she was like, 'I heard about that band. I m so sorry.' I was like What are you talking about.' The members of Her's were on their way to California for a show in Santa Ana after that sold-out performance in Phoenix when their passenger van was involved in a head-on collision with a wrong-way driver on Interstate 10 west of Centennial in La Paz County. The crash occurred just after 1 a.m. Wednesday, killing Stephen Fitzpatrick and Audun Laading of Her's their tour manager, Trevor Engelbrektson and the driver of the other vehicle, a Nissan pickup driving east in the westbound lane. The whole thing is just so unbelievably sad, Sanchez says. I thought about them all day Wednesday. I felt so high. And I felt so excited for them because they really had something super special. The show, Sanchez says, was amazing. It sounded great. They were funny. They were charismatic. You could tell they were just so genuinely happy to be there and be playing and playing together. They obviously had a really strong bond with each other. Get to know them Her's, the Liverpool indie-pop duo killed in wrong-way crash After the set, she and a friend hung around until they were almost done talking to fans so they could maybe get a couple of extra minutes with them. They were super nice, she says. I told them how they remind me of Prefab Sprout, which is one of my favorite bands, and how I really felt like they were gonna make it and I was so excited for them. They were so appreciative. We laughed and hugged and took a couple pictures and they were really excited because the tour was almost over and they were gonna go back to Liverpool but they were also excited that they were gonna come back here again in the fall. Her's fans plan memorial at crash site Vanessa Herb, an ASU grad student from Phoenix, made a trip to the crash site with a friend to create a memorial, including photos, testimonials and flowers arranged to resemble the cover of Invitation to Her's. We're just gonna head out there and leave a few things, she said a day before making the trip, and spread some positivity, because their families are from the U.K. so I feel like there's not really anybody based around here that can kind of memorialize them like that. So we just kind of took it on ourselves. Her first tweet after learning of the crash said she was DEVASTATED by the news. It's just a lot, she saya, especially because in the indie-alternative community, I'm friends with bands that know them and have toured with them and played at festivals with them. So it's just one of those, like, community things. She finds their music interesting, she says, because it's indie but it kind of blends electronic elements and then they have different characters in their vocals, too. I feel like it's a lot different than a lot of other music that's out right now. It just sucks because they're so creative and innovative. One last photo shoot Justin Yee had been wanting to see Her's for a while and was pretty pumped when the show was announced, he says at least until he realized he'd already purchased tickets to Aziz Ansari that same night. But I was like 'I've gotta see these guys I've been wanting to for so long,' he recalls. So he raced to the club when Ansari was over and got there just in time to see the last few songs and asked if he could take some pictures of the band as they were loading up the van to drive to California. That was moments before they got into their van, he says. He got into Her's after hearing Marcel, their second single, in 2016. I love to discover new music, he says. And that genre, I guess you'd call it bedroom pop, is right up my alley. They made music that brought an emotion out. Twitter responds to new of Her's crash Twitter was filled with fan testimonials Thursday and Friday, from Phoenix fans to Coldplay, who encouraged fans to join them in honoring Her's by listening to their incredible music. Beach Fossils posted a photo of the two bands hanging out in a Tweet that ended May they Rest in Peace knowing how much everybody loved them and their positive energy. Simon J. Webb, a British photographer, shared a photo he'd taken the first time he saw Her's, adding RIP guys, you were awesome. The formerly local Joel Marquard of Gospel Claws, Spiritual Warfare and the Greasy Shadows met Her's last weekend at the Treefort Music Fest in Boise, Idaho, where he was DJ'ing and they were playing. They were perfect, he says of their set. Sounded just like the album. He posted about that encounter on Facebook after hearing what had happened. I saw them and ran over and told them they were great, he wrote. They were so nice, genuine and full of life. Very sad news. Rebel Lounge 'We never thought it would be their last show' The Rebel Lounge posted a photo on Instagram, writing, It is with deep sorrow that we learn of the passing of Stephen Fitzpatrick and Audun Laading of the band Her's and their tour manager Trevor Englebrektson. We were honored to be able to host them on their US tour. We never thought it would be their last show, they deserved so many more. Our deepest condolences go out to all their families and friends and everyone else who believed in them. Reach the reporter at ed.masley arizonarepublic.com or 602-444-4495.

However, Athanasiou has struggled this season, with just five goals in 28 games along with a league-worst minus-31 rating. To that end, MLive s Ansar Khan suggests that Red Wings GM Steve Yzerman could be reaching the point where he believes it s time to move on from Athanasiou. The forward is one of several Red Wings players slated to become restricted free agents, and it s likely the team will be seeking long-term pacts with wingers Anthony Mantha and Tyler Bertuzzi. Given Athanasiou s struggles, it s harder to envision the Red Wings pursuing a long-term deal with him at this time. Of course, the timing for a trade isn t ideal as Detroit would be selling low, so if Yzerman does decide to move on, the offseason may be the better time to pull the trigger on a deal for Athanasiou.

Celtic Woman With the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra When 7 30 p.m. Dec. 18 Tickets 35- 70 Where Heinz Hall, Pittsburgh Details 412-392-4900 or pittsburghsymphony.org While fans are looking forward to hearing the lilting melodies of Celtic Woman when the group comes to Pittsburgh, the members likewise are looking forward to the stop. We ve been joining amazing orchestras all around the world, and the Pittsburgh Symphony is certainly one of them, says violinist harpist vocalist Tara McNeill. Heinz Hall is just stunning. We re looking forward to being there. The concert, part of Celtic Woman s Best of Christmas Symphonic Tour, will begin at 7 30 p.m. Dec. 18. The program will feature songs from the group s new album, The Magic of Christmas. McNeill says the album s 15 songs include beautiful arrangements of some old, traditional songs and songs that are new to Celtic Woman, with luscious orchestration backed by an amazing choir. From the sprightly Deck the Halls and Sleigh Ride to the contemplative O Come, O Come Emmanuel, the collection is a true celebration of the holiday season, she says. The group pays homage to its Irish roots in Dia Do Bheatha and Amid the Falling Snow, by fellow Irish songstress Enya, and to its interest in world music via Feliz Navidad. Following the holiday tour, Celtic Woman will be back on the road in 2020 for a Celebration tour, marking the group s 15th anniversary. Signature sound Celtic Woman has been going strong for so many years, and this will be a celebration of everything that Celtic Woman has done, McNeill says. A showcase for the talent of young female Irish singers, the group s repertoire encompasses Irish classics, contemporary songs, classical favorites and stirring originals. The lineup of performers has evolved in the years since the group s inception, but the signature sound of Celtic Woman has remained consistent, showcasing the members individual and collaborative talents, according to its website. Current members in addition to McNeill are vocalists Mairead Carlin, Eabha McMahon and Megan Walsh. A native of Antrim, Northern Ireland, McNeill joined Celtic Woman in 2016. She previously toured as a violinist and singer with the Irish choral ensemble Anuna. In 2015, she played the harp in the orchestra for the PBS special, Celtic Woman Destiny, filmed in Dublin. The accompanying album was nominated for Best World Music Album at the 59th Annual Grammy Awards, the first Grammy nomination for the group. It was my dream to be one of the principal performers, so when a place came open, I had to make sure I nailed that audition, she says. Love, loss, home While the group has long been a favorite of U.S. and European audiences, its popularity continues to spread to audiences around the globe, McNeill says. Music is a universal language that can travel all across the world, she says. I think that s especially true of Irish music. It s all about storytelling love, loss, home, traveling away and coming back, heartbreak. The melodies are so beautiful and that resonates with people everywhere. It s a great honor to be part of this, she says. It s amazing to see all the talent that s come out of it, but there s a responsibility to keep true to what Celtic Woman means in the style of playing and singing, but also to keep getting better, with arrangements becoming more modern and trying new things.

I don t want this released until I ve ruled, Circuit Court Judge Joseph Marx said in an emergency hearing, according to reports. Marx scheduled a hearing on the matter for April 29, according to ESPN. The office of Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Aronberg had said in court documents earlier Wednesday that Florida law requires it to provide the video to the public and the media as soon as possible rather than wait for a judge to determine whether the videos should be kept under seal while Lei Wang is prosecuted. Wang allegedly managed the Orchids of Asia Spa in Jupiter, Florida both she and the alleged owner, Hua Zhang, face a number of charges, including maintaining a house of prostitution. They have pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors had planned to release the videos as part of those cases, according to the documents. Local and national media outlets had made public records requests for the videos prosecutors said obscene images in the videos would be pixelated or blurred if they were released. Kraft s attorneys, and attorneys for some of the other men involved in the cases, filed motions Wednesday to stop the release of the videos. Kraft, who has pleaded not guilty to two misdemeanor charges of soliciting a prostitute, late last month waived an upcoming hearing and requested a jury trial on the charges, which stem from a sting operation at the massage parlor. Last week, his lawyers argued that release of the video could destroy his chances at a fair trial. If the affidavit says what happened, what is the interest the public has in seeing it. It s basically pornography, Kraft attorney William Burck said in a hearing Friday after local and national media outlets asked for the videos to be released. Prosecutors contend Kraft was caught on video engaging in a sex act with alleged prostitutes on two occasions in January, including once hours before the AFC championship game Jan. 20 at Kansas City. Burck wrote that the prosecutors plan to release the videos was an extraordinary and alarming development involving what appears to be gross prosecutorial misconduct, according to CNBC. Kraft, 77, has denied the allegations and has declined to accept a plea offer made to him and other men charged as part of the sting, in which prosecutors would drop charges if he admitted a trial would find him guilty and completed community service. In a written statement last month, Kraft said he is truly sorry and mentioned his wife, Myra, who died in 2011. Throughout my life, I have always tried to do the right thing, Kraft said in the statement. The last thing I would ever want to do is disrespect another human being. I have extraordinary respect for women my morals and my soul were shaped by the most wonderful woman, the love of my life, who I was blessed to have as my partner for 50 years. He remains subject to potential discipline by the NFL under a personal conduct policy that applies to owners as well as players and empowers Commissioner Roger Goodell to impose discipline, if he believes it is warranted, even if Kraft is not convicted of a crime.

Photo by John McCreary Icon Sportswire via Getty Images It s rare to see an undefeated reigning national champion overlooked as much as the Clemson Tigers have been slighted this year. Dabo Swinney was right. Here is an interesting statistic the last time the Clemson Tigers lost, Tua Tagavailoa was backing up Jalen Hurts. Not enough. Here s another one Joe Burrow had yet to take a snap at LSU. Still unimpressed. Fine. The last time Clemson lost a football game, Alaska and Hawaii weren t yet states. Okay. That last part wasn t true, but the fact that this team, the reigning national champions, are being slept-on and beneficiaries because of a weak schedule is a farce. Let s divorce ourselves from the fact Clemson are undefeated ACC champions again after their 62-17 win over Virginia, and just look at the bodies lining up on the field. If you knew that the first team to go 15-0 in a season returned its starting quarterback with an arm as golden as his flowing locks, an all-world halfback, four of five starting offensive linemen, and a receiving unit worthy of the moniker Wide Receiver U , would you think that team had anything to prove on offense. RELATED PRODUCT Aaron Rodgers Cal Bobblehead Buy Now. Buy Now. What if you then found out that the team was better on defense than the year before. In fact, that defense was the best in the country. Would you think that team has absolutely anything to prove. Now add in the fact that Clemson has won 29 straight games in a Power Five conference. Not the AAC but the ACC. Aside do you think that the AAC is a better conference than the ACC. Go ahead and ask Mike Norvell what he thinks. With wins against Texas A M and South Carolina of the mighty SEC out of conference. What in the world would you like Clemson to do. When most teams lay an egg on the road or at home, Georgia they pick up a tick in the L column. Clemson didn t. They held UNC on a two-point conversion. And somehow that counts as a pseudo loss. The world still has an I ll believe it when I see it attitude when it comes to the Tigers. Why. What else is left to see. Trevor Lawrence hasn t thrown an interception since before Halloween. Travis Etienne has more than 1,700 yards from scrimmage, including averaging more than eight yards per carry. If a defense manages to shut down Tee Higgins they won t , they would still have to answer for Justyn Ross and Amari Rodgers. On the defensive side of the ball, the Power Rangers are gone, but there s Isaiah Simmons and K Von Wallace and a defensive unit built to pressure the quarterback and not miss tackles. Even the weakest link, arguably Tanner Muse, is a monster with more experience than just about any player in college football. So why is this a team that is overlooked and not a slam dunk to be the No. 1 seed in the College Football Playoff. They have all of the pieces that they had last year when they beat one of the best Alabama teams in recent memory. They are playing better team defense than last year. Why isn t winning enough. Clemson is, once again, peaking at the end of the season. One theory. The Tigers aren t Alabama and they aren t Ohio State. That s the biggest reason. Throughout the season, Alabama, Ohio State and Clemson had similar strengths of schedule. Clemson even had the better quarterback from the state of Georgia. The thing Clemson lacked was name recognition. Ohio State, Alabama, those are already household names. They are supposed to be where Clemson is. Clemson, however, is less than a decade removed from being a meme. Clemson is less than 15 years removed from Clipboard Jesus. Mostly, what it comes down to are jealousy and hate. But you know what. Keep hating. All that hate is going to keep the Tigers warm through Jan. 13, 2020.

The numbers, reflecting the first time people have signed up through the state s new online marketplace, Nevada Health Link, represent a 7.4 percent decrease from last year s preliminary sign-up total of 83,600. Nevada had been relying for several years on Healthcare.gov, the federal website set up under former President Barack Obama s health care law, to allow people to shop for insurance online. But Nevada officials decided this year to move to a state-run system to save money, improve service and track data better. The online health insurance marketplaces allow people who don t get insurance through their job to shop for coverage and enroll in a plan. Silver State Health Insurance Exchange, the agency that runs Nevada s website, said nearly 66,000 people who had previously signed up for coverage on the federal website were moved to Nevada s website. The 66,000 figure is lower than last year s preliminary total because it reflects those who not only enrolled for coverage but also followed through and made payments, said Heather Korbulic, executive director of the exchange Korbulic expects that this year s numbers will increase as people who have been denied Medicaid coverage opt to enroll for insurance on the exchange.

His final day with the City of San Angelo will be July 5. Wilson joined the City in 2007 as its Civic Events manager, overseeing municipally owned venues such as Foster Communications Coliseum and the McNease Convention Center. He was named public information officer in 2012 and was promoted to communications director in December. During his watch, the office won more than 60 local, state and national awards programming on the City s governmental access channel was revamped to reduce the number of meetings and increase original content the City s website was redesigned its Facebook page grew to 30,000-plus followers media coverage increased audio-video equipment was modernized in the City Council chambers and a TV studio was built and equipped. Next month, the office will pilot one of the City s first two electric cars. Wilson was a dogged public relations advocate for the City of San Angelo, often diving into social media comment threads on San Angelo LIVE. and Facebook to defend a City policy. He advocated for the everyday City worker, like the laborers at the City Water Department, who were often derided on social media for not fixing broken pipes fast enough. Wilson made headlines when he opposed the publisher of San Angelo LIVE. over the secretive 2014 trash contract selection process. When media reports surfaced that Republic Services had overcharged commercial businesses in San Angelo over 6 million over a decade, Wilson could not deliver anything other than a draft audit the City conducted of Republic's alleged misconduct. Houston journalist Wayne Dolcefino stuck a microphone in Wilson's face asking Wilson to produce the audit. Wilson just stood there, silent, earning him the nickname, Crickets. We also called him the Minister of Information at times, but only jokingly.

WATCH Video of Crickets strike back HD 2 Despite the turbulence during the trash saga of 2014, Wilson was committed to free and open government. He spearheaded the acquisition of equipment and developed the policies and procedures to televise and publish videos of practically every public meeting involving a government action by the City of San Angelo. His well-written press releases described City policies and events with clarity not seen in even larger cities. He proved to be an effective project manager in the re-launch of the City of San Angelo website, a resource where he succeeded in answering almost any question a citizen may have about City of San Angelo governance or services. It s important San Angelo knows I love it, I love my job and I love serving our citizens, Wilson said. Our family is simply ready for a new landscape, a new lifestyle and a new adventure. Professionally, I m also eager for a different challenge. Belgrade and New England offer us all that. Even so, we ll be leaving a part of ourselves behind here. Belgrade is a town of about 3,200 residents in Central Maine. It is a popular summer vacation destination surrounded by seven lakes, including Great Pond, which inspired the setting for the Academy Award-winning movie On Golden Pond. City Videographer Brian Groves will lead the Public Information Office until a replacement is named. I m proud to have been a member of such a dedicated team of public servants, Wilson said. I stand in awe of my colleagues many varied talents and their commitment to serve their neighbors and to better their home. It s been an honor to shine a light on their work and to tell their stories. Wilson joined the City after working in print journalism for two decades, including as managing editor of the Standard-Times. His peers elected him to serve as the treasurer of the Texas Association of Municipal Information Officers. He is scheduled to graduate with his master of public administration degree in May. Anthony has poured himself into making our Public Information Office one of the state s best, City Manager Daniel Valenzuela said. It s a testament to his and Brian s partnership that they have built a structure and a culture that ensures our citizens can remain plugged into their local government. His ethic and genuine interest in good governance will serve Belgrade well. Wilson is hyper-talented, smart, and a leader, said Joe Hyde, publisher of San Angelo LIVE. He was agile and able to quickly leverage technology in addition to leverage his experience in journalism to better serve the citizens of San Angelo. The legacies of his accomplishments here as PIO for the City will serve this community well into the next decade.

We ve got lots of teachers, some doctors, many professional women and one petroleum engineer, he yelled over the din of vallenato music. All of them showed up with their degrees in hand. And all of them came from Venezuela. As Venezuela s economy continues to collapse amid food shortages, hyperinflation and U.S. sanctions, waves of economic refugees have fled the country. Those with the means have gone to places like Miami, Santiago and Panama.

A recent study suggested as many as 350,000 Venezuelans had entered Colombia in the last six years. But with jobs scarce, many young and not so young women are turning to the world s oldest profession to make ends meet. Dayana, a 30-year-old mother of four, nursed a beer as she watched potential clients walk down the dirt road that runs in front of wooden shacks, bars and bordellos. Dressed for work in brightly colored spandex, Dayana said she used to be the manager of a food-processing plant on the outskirts of Caracas. But that job disappeared after the government seized the factory and looted it, she said. Seven months ago, struggling to put food on the table, she came to Colombia looking for work. Without an employment permit, she found herself working as a prostitute in the capital, Bogot . While the money was better there, she eventually moved to Arauca, a cattle town of 260,000 people along the border with Venezuela, because it was easier to send food back to her children in Caracas. The previous night, her sister had traveled by bus for 18 hours from Caracas to pick up a bundle of groceries that Dayana had purchased pasta, tuna, rice, cooking oil and then immediately jumped on a bus back home. If you had told me four years ago that I would be here, doing this, I wouldn t have believed you, said Dayana, who asked that her last name not be used. But we ve gone from crisis to crisis to crisis, and now look where we are. With inflation running in excess of 700 percent and the bolivar currency in free fall, finding food and medicine in Venezuela has become a frustrating, time-consuming task. Dayana said she often would spend four to six hours waiting in line hoping to buy a bag of flour. Other times she was forced to buy food on the black market at exorbitant rates. Hunger in Venezuela is rampant. That has fueled a scramble to earn hard currency Colombian pesos or, even better, the U.S. dollar, which is the legal tender of Ecuador and Panama. Dayana said that on a good night she makes the equivalent of 50 to 100, selling her services 20 minutes at a time. Prostitution obviously isn t a good job, she said. But I m thankful for it, because it s allowing me to buy food and support my family. Selling sex is legal in Colombia, and even small towns have red-light districts where authorities look the other way. So while immigration police were actively hunting down Venezuelans selling trinkets and panhandling in Arauca s central square, the women along brothel row said they were rarely harassed. Marta Mu oz runs the Casa de la Mujer, a municipal program that focuses on women s health and rights. She said that prostitution is something of a blind spot for local authorities who are more focused on blatant crimes, like child trafficking, rape and the abuse of minors. I know that some of them are being paid unfairly and being treated very poorly, Mu oz said of the Venezuelan prostitutes. But how do we protect them without strong public policies. Read More Behold Colombia s bullet-proof tank-top S nchez and others in the sex industry say Venezuelans dominate the trade now because they re willing to work for less pay. I would say 99 percent of the prostitutes in this town are Venezuelan, he said. All 12 of the women who work for him are from the other side of the border. It s not just a border phenomenon. Fidelia Suarez, the president of Colombia s Union of Sex Workers, said her organization has seen a dramatic influx of Venezuelan women and men working in the sex trade across the country. While it s impossible to quantify how many might be working in the trade, Suarez said her organization is trying to safeguard the vulnerable migrants. We want to make sure they re not being harassed by authorities or taken advantage of, she said. Being sexually exploited is very different than being a sex worker. In a sense, Venezuela s economic crisis has been so severe that it has even upended long-held social norms. Marili, a 47-year-old grandmother and former teacher, said there was a time when she would have been ashamed to admit she s a prostitute. Now she says she s grateful to have a job that allows her to buy hypertension medication for her mother back in Caracas. We re all just women who are working to support our families, she said. I refuse to criticize anyone, including myself. We all have to work. Both Marili and Dayana said they told their families how they make a living. I don t like to keep secrets, Dayana said. Even S nchez, the 60-year-old brothel owner, says he was forced into the business by the Venezuelan crisis. Like many Colombians, S nchez moved to the neighboring country 30 years ago, when the oil rich nation was booming economically and Colombia was mired in violence. There, he had solid work in Caracas repainting cars. When the crisis killed that job several years ago, he began smuggling Venezuelan wood and its cheaper-than-water gasoline into Colombia. Eventually, things got so bad he decided to return to Colombia permanently. He and his wife opened the brothel, called Show Malilo Night Club. S nchez s nickname is Malilo. This place is mine, thank God, he said of the modest building, strung with Christmas lights to provide ambiance. But it hurts me deeply what s happening over there. Read More Is Maduro profiting from hunger. Marili said the couple had been lifesavers giving her a place to stay and a way to make a living. Not just anyone will lend you a hand, she said. These people are humanitarians. There seems to be no end in sight for Venezuela s economic pain. Last month, the Trump administration restricted Caracas ability to borrow money from American creditors, which will undoubtedly deepen the crisis. And yet, President Nicol s Maduro has been digging in, avoiding the economic reforms that economists say are necessary. Dayana dreams of a day when she ll be able to go home and start a small clothing boutique. Asked when she thought that might happen, she shook her head. No one knows, she said. We just have to be patient. ", "title": "In Venezuela, they were teachers and doctors.

Photo via Zaineb Hussein Wayne County DETROIT Wayne County, Michigan s most populous, has undergone a series of dramatic economic changes since staring down bankruptcy in 2015, culminating in a 2018 annual general fund surplus of 146.6 million under the leadership of County Executive Warren Evans. Among those engineering the turnaround has been Assistant County Executive and Economic Development Executive Director Khalil Rahal, a Dearborn native, Fordson High School graduate, former college football national champion at Grand Valley State University and former prosecutor. Rahal s leadership has earned him three major awards in the past year and a half, including the prestigious MEDA Michigan Economic Developers Association Medalist of the Year Award earlier this month. Rahal didn t know he was nominated for the award until receiving a text from David Schreiber, the business development manager of the Wayne County Economic Development Corporation EDC , who nominated and accepted it on behalf of his colleague. Wayne County is becoming a player again in economic development, but in a collaborative way that builds around the assets of its 43 distinct communities, Schreiber said at the August 15 event. No one works harder than Khalil and it s paying off. Wayne County is open for business and a strong partner in a way it hasn t been in quite some time and investors are taking notice. That s good news for the region and state. The award was given to, an economic leader demonstrating a commitment to the profession of economic development, his dedication to the growth of his or her community, and with a strong record of achievement over his or her career. The significance of the award was not lost on Rahal. This award came from my peers in the field of economic development, he said. The last year and a half has been very special for me. Rahal was also named to the Crain s 40 Under 40 list for Metro Detroit business leaders and 50 Names to Know in Government List for 2019. Under Rahal, Wayne County has refocused its efforts on supporting existing businesses, building a world-class logistics hub and putting properties back into productive use. He s led efforts to sell the former McLouth Steel Plant in Trenton, putting it on a path to productive use, and is overseeing a project to revitalize three former Ford Motor Company Village and industry mills. He s managed to fill the iconic Guardian Building where he works downtown to 95 percent capacity, making it financially solvent, while continuing to make economic strides throughout the county. In Dearborn Heights, he engineered the sale of the Warren Valley golf club to the city for 1.8 million, a deal Rahal said helped save money for both the county and the city. A revamped team has helped make these and other deals possible. We ve had to completely redo the Economic Development Department here, Rahal said. At the time Evans took over in 2015, we were facing some really difficult financially circumstances Today we have a brand new department it s got three divisions, we ve got staff and it has been rebuilt to the point where we ve accomplished a lot of great projects. For Rahal, who once lived next to Hines Park in Dearborn, a vision of a more connected Detroit is among his long-term plans. Hines Park directly ends in Dearborn and one of the things about the region is, there s no way to get from the east side of the county to the west side or vice versa in a non-motorized way there s no connectivity, Rahal told The Arab American News in an interview last week. He envisions future projects, including bike paths from Detroit to the end of Hines Park, with new developments including a rooftop restaurant, museums and the revitalization of the historic mills in the area, which are steeped with historical ties to Henry Ford, Thomas Edison, Rosie the Riveter from World War II and others. Rahal said he hopes to create public-private partnerships that will allow others to take over the historic mills, perhaps a few years down the line, to help turn them into exciting new historical attractions. One of the visions the county executive has is for helping us connect one another, he said. Evans brought on Rahal to lead the county s economic development efforts in 2015. He s been an amazing mentor, Rahal said. The way I would describe Mr. Evans is, a they don t make them like they used to kind of thing. He s been an amazing leader and I ve learned a lot under his tutelage he s given me the freedom to be able to take on projects, some of which are controversial, but for the right reasons. Rahal s experience has enabled him to become a better executive himself, as evidenced by his unprecedented recent string of awards. His peers have also taken notice, as has Evans. As the county continues to rebuild, Khalil s job is to protect property values and grow the tax base so our 43 communities can thrive, Evans said. He s done a phenomenal job. Whether it s putting properties on a path toward revitalization or positioning the county to grow as a world-class logistics hub, he s been essential to our progress. You can t say enough about what putting properties back into productive use does for the county s fiscal well-being and quality of life. It s critical to protecting and growing property values and positioning communities to prosper, said Wayne County Commissioner Sam Baydoun. Michael Samhat, president of Crown Enterprises Inc., a Warren-based real estate firm that purchased the contaminated McLouth plant for 4 million in 2017, is also impressed by Rahal s ability to provide balanced leadership. There is a natural tug-of-war that occurs in negotiations that can easily kill a deal, he said. While Khalil is a relentless advocate for the best interests of the county, he s fair and reliable, which is essential to bringing complex transactions like McLouth to fruition. Upcoming challenges for Rahal and the department include investing in and paving the way for new developments in public transportation in the region, which he calls the biggest key for fostering economic growth in the region. In a world that is becoming increasingly more connected, Rahal continues to push for Metro Detroit to take on a leadership role in logistics and data as well. A lot of things will require the transfer of a lot of information in the future like data research, he said when asked about the advice he would give to local entrepreneurs. And a lot of it is going to be an educational process, so don t be afraid to learn what you don t know. The world is going to be changing very, very quickly and there are very few experts in that space.

GET OFFER Liftoff. As the United Launch Alliance s Delta IV heavy rocket soared over the hills and into the stratosphere, it scrawled a tiny, blazing pen stroke on the blue winter sky. The hundreds of gathered spectators murmured in awe. It s an awesome thing to see a rocket flying into the sky, said Loyd Champion of Port Hueneme. The fire, the power. The launch in January and the most recent one in June drew hundreds of people to the rural area surrounding Vandenberg Air Force Base, all hoping to view the biggest spectacle the Central Coast has to offer. The launches, especially those from high-profile space companies such as Elon Musk s SpaceX, have thrust the local base back into the collective imagination after a post-Space Race lull during which it labored in relative obscurity. As we enter a new era of space exploration from the United States highly-anticipated return to the moon to commercial space exploration and new missions that could lead to the eventual colonization of Mars the final frontier is closer to humanity s fingertips than it has been in decades. And Vandenberg could play an integral part in all of that. If its high-profile launches continue paired with a potentially epochal push to have it house the new Space Command Vandenberg Air Force Base seems poised at the precipice of a new Space Age. I think it is an exciting time for the Central Coast, Col. Anthony Mastalir, commander of the 30th Space Wing at Vandenberg Air Force Base, told The Tribune in an interview Oct. 3. I think there is no doubt when I look at how much venture capital investment is taking place this is becoming something that I read about just about every day or every other day. That s a lot of investment that is being put into commercial space. I think it is an exciting time for Vandenberg. Team Vandenberg supported the successful launch of a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket carrying a National Reconnaissance Office payload from Space Launch Complex-6, Jan. 19, at 11 10 am PST. Airman 1st Class Aubree Milks 30th Space Wing Why is Vandenberg involved in space launches at all. To understand why Vandenberg is so integral to today s space operations requires a quick geography lesson. We sit on a prime piece of real estate, said Col. Michael Hough, former commander of the Air Force base, in an interview with The Tribune in March before his retirement this summer. The military installation is located on an 118,000-acre plot of land that sandwiches the city of Lompoc. The southwestern-most portion of the base juts into the Pacific Ocean, giving it a great location for polar orbit missions ones that go around the Earth s poles . According to Hough, the base s position allows it to launch rockets south over uninhabited ocean safer than sending them literally above people s heads, he said. The base s polar orbit possibilities are a key reason Vandenberg was once the planned home of the country s second shuttle launch facility, a partner to the Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, Florida. The shuttle launch complex was built but then scrapped after the Challenger exploded in 1986. In more recent years, Vandenberg s prime location has made it a convenient choice for a new breed of intrepid entrepreneurs hoping to capitalize on the satellite boom. A SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, carrying the final Iridium mission this year, launches from Space Launch Complex-4E at Vandenberg Air Force Base, CA on Jan. 11, 2019 at 7 31 a.m. PST. Hanah Abercrombie 30th Space Wing SpaceX and United Launch Alliance missions boost fame One such company was Elon Musk s SpaceX, which began to launch its Falcon 9 rockets from Vandenberg in September 2013. In total, the commercial space company has launched 15 times from the Central Coast base, according to its launch manifest, with the majority of those happening in 2017 and 2018. This year, the company has launched from Vandenberg only twice, however, as it shifts focus to developing its first crewed missions. This has sparked rumors that SpaceX s days at the local base are coming to a close. For his part, Mastalir said he does not expect SpaceX will leave the Central Coast any time soon. I don t see Space X disappearing from Vandenberg at least that s not what I ve seen, he said noting that the company will likely need to launch from Vandenberg as it fills out its next-generation internet satellite constellation, Starlink. Another company that kept eyes on Vandenberg in the past decade was United Launch Alliance, a joint venture between Lockheed Martin and Boeing. The company, which leases two of Vandenberg s available launch pads, has launched from the local base 39 times since 2006, when ULA was formed. Launch activity peaked in 2009 when the company sent five rockets into orbit, but since then it has steadily launched two or three times per year. That s except for 2019, when United Launch Alliance has launched a rocket only once. The company retired its Delta II rocket, which launched from Vandenberg s SLC-2W pronounced Slick 2W , in 2018, and its remaining two rockets the Delta IV and Atlas V have been launched off of the East Coast range three times this year. A test of the nation s Ground-based Midcourse Defense system, was conducted from North Vandenberg, March 25 at 10 32 a.m. PDT by 30th Space Wing officials, the U.S. Missile Defense Agency, and U.S. Northern Command. Vandenberg Air Force Base Waxing and waning launch schedule After a steady stream of high-profile launches kept Vandenberg top of mind for most of 2018 and early 2019, the once rigorous schedule has definitely lulled. As of October, Vandenberg has no major launches planned for the rest of the year. The next potential launch is listed as only Sept. 2020 on SpaceArchive.info, a website that tracks launches out of the base the website is not officially affiliated with Vandenberg Air Force Base . A separate SpaceX launch originally expected in early 2020 also seems to be pushed off the local manifest, leaving the rocket launch schedule glaringly empty. There s no reason for it, it just happened to be the timing and how it worked out, Mastalir said of the lull. That could change, however, as the schedule at Cape Canaveral backs up. Mastalir noted that the schedule for the Eastern range out of Florida is becoming harder to get on to, leaving some opportunity for Vandenberg to come in and offer easier, quicker launches. I ve talked to some folks that have said the launch industry kind of waxes and wanes a little bit here on the Western range, Mastalir said. I m not saying that those days are over, what I m saying is that what I see is an increased demand for space launch and it s not going to be satisfied entirely by the Eastern range. The Western range is going to be part of that solution. That s where more small commercial launches could come in to save the day. We are absolutely postured right now to do whatever we can to facilitate commercial, Mastalir said. It s in our national interest to do so. Col.

Jason Aftanas, 30th Civil Engineer Squadron commander, watch the Spaceflight SSO-A SmallSat Express on a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket at the Emergency Operation Center Dec. 3, 2018 at 10 34 a.m. Airman 1st Class Aubree Milks 30th Space Wing Firefly, Blue Origin on the horizon As its launch schedule has slowed, Vandenberg officials have started courting smaller commercial space companies to start launching from the Central Coast. One such company is newcomer Firefly Aerospace. The aeronautics company, based out of Austin, Texas, currently leases SLC-2W, the former Delta II launchpad, at Vandenberg Air Force Base. It intends to launch its first rocket from the base by the end of the first quarter of 2020, according to media spokesman Eric Salwan. Part of the company s claim to fame is the low price per kilogram for payloads. A Firefly mission on its Alpha rocket costs 15 million, the lowest price per kilogram for any small satellite launch vehicle in an advanced stage of development, Salwan said. It s also not in competition with companies like SpaceX and ULA, which build larger rockets, because Firefly is focused on building smaller launch vehicles, he said. According to Salwan, approximately 80 of Firefly customers have expressed an interest in polar orbit launches, making Vandenberg a great fit for the company. SLC-2W is a historic launch complex and has provided exceptional service to the USA, Salwan wrote in an email to The Tribune. Most recently, the Delta II launch vehicle operated from SLC-2W. Delta II uses the same propellants as Firefly Alpha, and repurposing this site for Firefly commercial small satellite launch is an exceptional opportunity to continue launches from this site. The company is in the early stages of building a mass production facility in Florida and has been tapped by NASA to deliver payloads to the moon but that doesn t mean it will be leaving Vandenberg any time soon. California has a great aerospace background and work force and will continue to play an important part in the future of space exploration, Salwan wrote. Firefly expects to launch from VAFB for decades to come. Meanwhile, a space company backed by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos is also narrowing in on a site at Vandenberg. Blue Origin has partnered with the Air Force to get a national security space certification and develop a Vandenberg launch site for its New Glenn rocket, it announced in 2018. Honored to be selected by usairforce through the LSA acquisition. With this, we will pursue a Vandenberg launch site and gain certification for national security missions.

The New Glenn rocket is first expected to launch out of Cape Canaveral, though it would eventually also be able to launch out of Vandenberg, according to the website. The company was founded by Bezos in 2000 as part of a push to provide private human access to space. Blue Origin media representatives did not respond to requests for further comment on potential Vandenberg plans or a timeline for when it could select a site. Hourglass Project Vandenberg officials have also partnered with The Hourglass Project a Central Coast economic initiative to encourage more companies to consider launching from the local base. The opportunity for commercial space launch expansion at Vandenberg Air Force Base is a once-in-a-generation opportunity, Hourglass Project CEO Melissa James told The Tribune. The global space industry is currently 350 billion and projected to grow to 2.7 trillion in the next 30 years. The Hourglass Project is working with the state, the Air Force and cutting-edge private space companies to create a thriving spaceport at Vandenberg Air Force to take more cargo and people to space. Some of the initiative s top goals are to encourage more investment in the base both government and private and drafting an integrated master plan for commercial space opportunities that could help drive it moving forward. In the meantime, locals can expect to see more launches next year and beyond. Relative to 2019, 2020 will be a slight uptick but it s not where we are headed, Mastalir said. We re still kind of coming. We ll be steady state for a year and then we are going to see an increase in launches in some of the out years. Col. Anthony Mastalir, new commander of the 30th Space Wing at Vandenberg Air Force Base, speaks to the media on Oct. 3. Kaytlyn Leslie kleslie thetribunenews.com Space Command Commercial companies aren t the only force potentially pulling Vandenberg into a new era. The base made a short list of six potential headquarters for the newly reformed Space Command, alongside four bases in Colorado and one in Alabama. The headquarters would house Space Command, which could eventually morph into President Donald Trump s more controversial proposed Space Force. Space Command would essentially be in charge of space warfare by deploying resources from the current military branches, while the Space Force would create an entirely new military branch to handle operations in space. The reality is, space has become a warfighting domain whether we like it or not, Mastalir said. Our adversaries are driving in that direction and we the U.S. Air Force, the U.S. government are responsible to protect the space assets upon which we and the American people rely on every day. The American way of life is enabled by space, he added. Vice President Mike Pence tours the Combined Space Operations Center July 10, 2019, at Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif. While at the CSpOC, Pence met with base leadership and received briefings on the evolution of launch operations at the Western Range and CSpOC operations, which concluded with an all-call to the service men and women of Vandenberg AFB. Airman 1st Class Hanah Abercrombie 30th Space Wing Public Affairs Besides bragging rights, becoming the Space Command headquarters would translate into a huge boost to the local economy, which is why California lawmakers have avidly petitioned the Department of Defense for Vandenberg to secure the coveted spot. Congressman Salud Carbajal, Sen. Dianne Feinstein and presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris sent a letter to the Secretary of the Air Force in May urging the Lompoc Air Force base to be chosen as the central headquarters for the new combatant command. Assemblyman Jordan Cunningham, who represents the 35th District, submitted his own letter in support in April. Mastalir said he believed Vandenberg was singled out because of its unused potential. One of the things I always talk about when it comes to Vandenberg is there is a lot of opportunity here at this base, he said. We have a lot of room. We have 100,000 acres. So in terms of mission growth which may mean more people, more jobs, more economic development Vandenberg has a lot to offer. And the Air Force is keenly aware of that. That s why you find Vandenberg is often in the discussion when it comes to these things. Though the decision could inject new life into the local base, Mastalir didn t appear to be holding his breath for it. It s always good to be on the list is what I always say, Mastalir said with a shrug. Better than being left off the list entirely. As of October, the Air Force had yet to make a decision on where the headquarters will be located. Maj. Gen. Stephen N. Whiting, the Combined Force Space Component Commander and 14th Air Force commander, speaks after assuming command of the CFSCC Oct. 1, 2019, at Vandenberg Air Force Base, Calif. Staff Sgt. Brittany E. N. Murphy 30th Space Wing Public Affairs In the meantime, the local base did secure an integral component of U.S. Space Command s operations. The Combined Forces Space Component Command, which was officially established at Vandenberg on Oct. 1, supports U.S. military operations in space with services like satellite communications, missile warning, nuclear detonation detection, environmental monitoring and other responsibilities. That s a critically important mission, Mastalir said, noting that he foresees even more changes on that front at Vandenberg as U.S. Space Command kind of grows into its own in the coming years. The Range of the Future With both potential military and commercial space missions growing in the future, Mastalir has an eye on bringing the base into the future. One of my priorities here is what we call Range of the Future and that s really not just about commercial space, he said. That s really about modernizing all of the launch infrastructure that we have here. Some of the changes that need to be made include enlarging the port for rocket retrieval, updating electrical resiliency and communication systems, repurposing existing launch pads and potentially even building new ones, Mastalir said. It ll also be about keeping up with the latest launch technology, and taking advantage of the new world of space exploration that is opening up. What would this mean. More rocket launches. Definitely. New cutting edge space exploration companies leasing spaces at the base. Check. Space tourists coming and going on their way to the moon and beyond. Maybe. As our technology improves and as we become more sophisticated is there a day where we will be launching rockets the same way that United Airlines launches aircraft out of LAX. Yeah, could be, Mastalir said. And how many of those are going to be heading to Mars as part of colonization or just for vacation. It s kind of fascinating when you think about where this could go. We just want to continue and evolve as that demand grows.

A broken back, neck, pelvis and wrist, fractured kneecaps, cracked ribs, and bleeding on the brain. Those are just some of the injuries sustained by a 13-year-old boy when a car struck him as he walked his 8-year-old sister to a school bus stop during a reported road rage incident the morning of Sept. 18. Wellfred Hallens remains in critical condition nine days after a Chrysler PT Cruiser hit him, and Lt. Alan Johnson of the Greenville Police Department said doctors believe his recovery will take at least a year. There is no estimated time frame as to when he will be discharged from the hospital , Johnson said. Johnson said police arrested 56-year-old Norman Gardner, of Taylors, on Sept. 25 in connection with the reported road rage incident. A search of public jail records shows Gardner posted 400 bond and was released later that day. Johnson said Gardner was behind the wheel of the car that hit Hallens and is charged with reckless driving. He will have a municipal court hearing in mid-October. Gardner lost control of the vehicle while traveling about 75 mph 30 mph over the posted limit before going onto the sidewalk and striking Hallens, Johnson said. The car then continued up the sidewalk until it hit a utility pole with enough force that it snapped it in half. Road rage Mom who was teaching son to drive killed in Milwaukee shooting A sedan was also involved in the incident and the other driver was investigated but not charged, Johnson said on Friday. The driver of the other car honked at the PT Cruiser when Gardner cut them off, Johnson said. Gardner began following the sedan and driving aggressively. He reportedly lost control of the car when he accelerated to pass the sedan and abruptly tried to cut it off. If you start to feel your temper flare, and you start to get mad, the best advise that we can give is pull off on the side of the road, take a deep breath, calm down, and then get back in the road to drive, Johnson said.

Countries and airlines around the world banned the 737 MAX this week after a deadly Ethiopian Airlines plane crash killed all 157 people on board. The disaster followed a fatal crash of the same model operated by Lion Air in Indonesia in October. For airlines that over-ordered the latest version of Boeing's 737 workhorse, the grounding could be a good excuse to delay or cancel purchases, saving cash on the balance sheet, analysts said. These unfortunate developments could give airlines that have potentially over-ordered an opportunity to review their requirements and fleet strategy, CAPA Centre for Aviation Chief Analyst Brendan Sobie said. Many airlines have had to quickly find other aircraft to substitute for the grounded 737 MAX, which has also complicated plans by airlines to use the fuel-efficient, longer-range jet to serve new destinations. Southwest Airlines Co., the world's largest operator of the MAX, was planning to fly the jet on its new California-Hawaii route later this year, while Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes inaugurated flights from Brazil to Orlando and Miami in November after receiving its first 737 MAX planes. Normally there are financial penalties for airlines that cancel orders and for manufacturers that do not deliver according to the contract terms. It was unclear how much legal leverage the MAX grounding might give airlines to wiggle out of commitments or seek damages for costs and lost revenue. Among airlines that may regret ordering too many 737 MAX, Sobie cited Vietnam's VietJet Aviation JSC, which he said had based a decision to expand from an all-Airbus A320 fleet by adding 200 737 MAX jets on a flawed strategy of opening joint ventures in overseas markets. VietJet said it was closely monitoring developments and would make a decision about its order once more is known. Among other Asian airlines, financially troubled Malaysia Airlines said on Friday that its order for 25 737 MAX jets was under review. Garuda Indonesia said this week it might cancel its order for 20 737 MAXs, which it had already reduced from 49 before the crash. Lion Air, one of Boeing's top three MAX customers in terms of total orders, had already thrown into question 187 unfilled orders after its October crash. It told Reuters on Wednesday it would halt all planned 737 MAX deliveries until after a final report into its crash is released later this year. In Europe, analysts said there was a case for and against cash-strapped Norwegian Air canceling MAX orders The ban would offer a reprieve from debt commitments but could leave the airline at the back of a congested Airbus order queue or increase operating costs if flights were replaced with less fuel-efficient jets. Loss-making Norwegian already said in February it was postponing delivery of 12 MAX aircraft from 2020 to 2023 and 2024 to cut expenditure and shift its focus from expansion to profitability, and this week became the first major airline to publicly say it will seek compensation from Boeing over the MAX grounding. A Norwegian Air spokesman declined to comment on Friday on whether it was discussing delaying or canceling altogether MAX 8 orders, saying it was in dialog with Boeing about a range of topics but had nothing new to share. FLEET PAIN For many large carriers like American Airlines Group Inc and China Southern Airlines Co Ltd, the 737 MAX a tiny proportion of the total fleet. But smaller airlines Iceland Air, Poland's LOT and Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA had planned to use 737 MAX jets to cover 25 percent, 17 percent and 11 percent of their summer schedules respectively, Goodbody analyst Mark Simpson said, giving them a higher exposure to the grounding. This is going to impact on their operations and cash flow, he said. Particularly into the Easter peak season next month and potentially through the summer as well... People will be scrambling for spare aircraft and there are not many, so lease rates will rise. Meanwhile, Air Canada on Friday became the first major airline to publicly attach dollars and cents to the uncertainty surrounding the 737 MAX, saying it was suspending its 2019 financial forecasts.

Other essential government personnel, meanwhile, have been forced to work without pay. Asked about reports of federal workers calling in sick, Trump said they have to do what they have to do, but asserted the practice has not been widespread. The president will travel to Camp David while Vice President Pence and his team remain in Washington, D.C., to meet with congressional aides to negotiate an end to the shutdown. Trump told reporters outside the White House that he doesn't expect a breakthrough in Sunday's meeting, but that there will be very serious talks during the week. The president has demanded 5 billion in funding for his proposed border wall, while Democrats have offered 1.3 billion for border security but said they will not provide money for the structure. Trump has dug in on his demand for funding, while offering shifting descriptions of the wall. He has inaccurately claimed parts of the wall are already being built and that Mexico is paying for it over time, while also insisting Congress must fund the project. The president has said the structure does not need to be made of concrete, but could instead be constructed with steel slats, something he raised again on Sunday.

Gov. Jerry Brown, November 2018 Gavin, screw up. Please. Make mistakes. Big ones. Because your state needs more screw-ups. Over the past eight years, Jerry Brown made a fetish out of his own caution. He focused relentlessly on balancing the budget and otherwise did as little as possible. When he did take the initiative, it was to undo things, like unwinding redevelopment agencies and the school accountability system, and shrinking big projects high-speed rail and the Delta tunnels in order to save them. He took perverse pride in inaction it was proof he was realistic and wouldn t be drawn into unwinnable battles. But Brown s small-bore policy-making left many of California s biggest problems to fester. The state s housing shortage grew into a crisis. Poverty, particularly among children, became more entrenched. The state s basic systems from road infrastructure to courts grew more clogged. Rapidly rising costs for pensions consumed new school revenues. When pressed on why he didn t do more, Brown s answer was that many problems can t be fixed. He said fixing the state s housing predicament would be too hard. He pooh-poohed the goal of reducing the student achievement gap between rich and poor. He refused to tackle California s obvious structural problems in taxation and governance, telling The Atlantic, That d be tough. You work in the real world. Through inaction, Brown created a quandary for his successor Gavin, can you screw up the courage to tackle our biggest challenges. We don t yet know the answer to that question. Newsom ran on the slogan Courage for a Change and audacious goals for health care, housing and education. But lately, he s made Brown-style noises about not wanting to do much, so he, too, can avoid mistakes. Newsom, if he pursues his campaign agenda forcefully, is certain to be dogged by failure. To quote the billionaire screw-up Elon Musk, If things are not failing, you are not innovating enough. Creating a new system for early childhood development will involve changes to existing programs that may screw up some people s lives and create a host of potentially failure-inducing challenges including funding for such programs and training of their staffs. Every step of establishing a system that guarantees higher-quality care for everyone is likely to produce giant mistakes. Newsom s determination to produce 3.5 million homes to ease the housing crisis will require tricky shifts in state and local laws that are all but certain to cause screw-ups. After the quiet Brown years, every noisy screw-up will draw negative media coverage. Indeed, the best way to judge Newsom might be by perception. If he s being pilloried for mistakes, that will mean he s taking on big stuff. If things are quiet, he s pulling a Brown and avoiding the hardest problems. The good news is that Newsom will have many allies. While the media narrative of California s comeback revolves around the 80-year-old governor, this decade s real story is of California communities pulling themselves out of the Great Recession without much help from their budget-conscious state. A cautious governor would temper the public hunger for action. But California needs a leader who will feed the hunger with plans and engage people in the messy work of enacting them. The new governor s advisers, a conventional lot, may warn him against this riskier path. In response, Newsom should invoke the wisdom of the Oracle of Montecito, Oprah Winfrey Think like a queen. A queen is not afraid to fail. Failure is another steppingstone to greatness. Dare to be great, Gavin. Be our queen of screw-ups.

The Silvertips extended their winning streak to four games and have won nine of their past 10 games. What I ve liked is we ve won in different fashions, Silvertips coach Dennis Williams said of the recent stretch. We ve had some where special teams have won it for us.

He was given 5 for charging and a GM pic.twitter.com DVqyokuAyH Brandon Rivers BriversWHL November 10, 2019 Fairbrother appeared to be OK, but he was down on the ice as mayhem broke out in the Silvertips corner. At what point do our players get protected. Williams said. It s a gross hit. It led to Wylie dropping the mitts with Simon Kubicek and Butt picking up a match penalty. Wedman was also given a game misconduct in addition to his charging penalty. After that was sorted out, Andrej Kukuca and Aidan Sutter fought almost immediately after the ensuing faceoff. I thought the guys did exactly what hockey players do, Williams said. Throughout the game, we had liberties taken on us all game, and there s no protection on that, so our guys have to defend themselves. They don t, they re not getting any help. That s how hockey is played. It was yet another chapter in the Seattle-Everett rivalry. With suspensions potentially coming. HOW IT WENT DOWN The Silvertips struck first as an unattended Butt one-timed a puck that leaked into the slot to put Everett up 1-0 just 32 seconds into the second period. Mitchell scored his second goal of the season and his second goal in as many games at 6 50 in the second to extend Everett s lead to two. After Fasko-Rudas power-play goal at 9 32 in the third, Tyrel Bauer smoked a point shot over Karki s glove at 11 11 in the period to briefly cut the lead to 3-1. Wylie cashed in on an empty net by firing one from his own defensive zone at 17 18 in the third to make the score 4-1, but the Thunderbirds answered quick with the extra skater and Matthew Rempe scored the first of his WHL career at 18 23 to make it 4-2. KEY PERFORMERS Fasko-Rudas tallied a goal and an assist, putting him at five points in six games since returning against Vancouver on Oct. 25.

This implies that he worked out what global heating means for our economy, given what climate scientists say will happen to our planet. But Nordhaus s predictions of what global heating will cost the earth are dangerously at odds with the science. In his Nobel Prize lecture, Nordhaus described a 4 C increase in global average temperature as optimal that is, the point at which the costs and benefits of mitigating climate change are balanced. In a subsequent academic paper based on this lecture, he stated that damages are estimated to be 2 percent of output at a 3 C global warming and 8 percent of output with 6 C warming . This is a trivial level of damage, equivalent for the 6 C warming case to a fall in the rate of economic growth over the next century of less than 0.1 per year. Nordhaus s conclusions are based in part on the simple but wayward assumption that the weak relationship between temperature and GDP within the US today can be used to assume how future global temperature rises will affect the economy. For example, the coldest state in mainland US is North Dakota, with an average temperature of 4.9 C and a high GDP per head US 67,000 in 2018. Slightly warmer states such as New York 9.0 C, US 73,000 tend to have higher GDPs, while the hottest state Florida, at 22.1 C has a lower GDP US 43,000 . This implies that past a certain point, higher temperatures reduce GDP, but the relationship is very weak huge changes in temperature result in relatively small changes in income. If it were true that this weak relationship could be applied to global temperature change, then global warming would indeed be nothing to worry about. However, the relationship between temperature and GDP within one country today tells you absolutely nothing about how the world will change if global temperatures rise by 10 C. This can be hard to grasp, since we re talking about the truly unknown humanity has never experienced global temperatures that high. But we can assess how unrealistic Nordhaus s work is because it predicts exactly the same damages for a fall in global temperature as it does for a rise. It predicts, for example, that both a 4 C rise and a 4 C fall in temperature would reduce global GDP by 3.6 . The average global temperature during the last Ice Age was 4 C cooler than today. There s no way we can accurately predict what GDP would be in such a cool world today, but we know that most of Europe north of Berlin, and of America north of New York, would be under a kilometre of ice. To argue that this would cut GDP by just 3.6 is simply absurd. Trillions at stake Indeed, estimates from climate scientists based on relatively conservative figures from the IPCC suggest that limiting global warming to 1.5C instead of 2C are likely to save trillions of dollars by 2100, even accounting for the costs of increased action. Uncertainties in climate modelling mean that this analysis is by no means definite. But given the distinct possibility that 2 C of warming could set off a cascade of tipping points that cause the planet to irreversibly heat to catastrophic temperatures, can we afford to play with fire. The risk to organised human civilisation of sending Earth into a nightmare hothouse state should be sufficient alone to justify the higher cost of a decarbonisation timescale compatible with 1.5 C. Even if letting warming reach 2 C or above turned out to be more cost-effective, the saved money is not worth the moral costs of species extinctions, habitat destruction, and forcing climate refugees from their homes. Read more Hothouse Earth here's what the science actually does and doesn't say The faith that William Nordhaus and others have in the incredible adaptability of human economies is almost admirable in a sense. But that adaptability has occurred in a remarkably stable climate where global temperatures have fluctuated by 1 below or above the average for the last 10,000 years. If that climate stability breaks down, then human adaptability will almost certainly break down with it. Many climate scientists are now calling for the focus on economy efficiency and incremental change that economists have taken to global warming to be abandoned. When supposedly respected experts disagree so fundamentally over an issue, it would be understandable for the public to switch off. But in this case, such a reaction would be wildly dangerous. Just as energy companies have been accused of paralysing the political response to climate change, the trivialising of the dangers of climate breakdown by mainstream economists has paralysed bold and timely action on climate breakdown for almost 50 years. In that time, humanity s population has doubled, and the average amount each person consumes has more than doubled. If we don t challenge the na ve assurances of economists that all will continue to be well, the human economies they believed they were defending will tumble just as fast.

We've waited seven years for this to happen, we're ready to go, said Warriors President Rick Welts.The Warriors will play their first preseason game at Chase next month, but tonight it's all about the music. Fans started lining up early to be the first inside. It doesn't get any better than this, I've been to 21 Metallica concerts, said fan John Cooper from Florida.But one issue that many who live or work near the Chase Center are anticipating has to do with how people will actually get to the arena, and the traffic and parking nightmare that comes with it.The problems begin over at the Third Street Bridge, which is down to two lanes of traffic because of construction, says Arne Hillesland, who lives in San Francisco. The combination of Third Street Bridge closed and the construction at Chase Center was like a double whammy, says Hillesland.Over by Chase Center, street signs point out the extra restrictions on days an event is being held at the arena.There is already limited street parking, with much of it available to only those with a residential parking permit. And the nearby UCSF parking lots are off-limits to concert goers If you do find metered parking, it's 7 an hour with a four hour limit, and the meters run until 10PM.The Chase Center also doesn't provide much parking, which is another concern for Hillesland. What does Chase Center have. Like 900 parking spots, something like that. And 18,000 seats. I think it's going to be interesting, says Hillesland.Public transportation will likely be the best option BART to San Francisco, then Muni to Chase Center. Muni is offering free rides to anyone with an event ticket and drops passengers off right at the Chase Center.Tammy Glover rides an electric scooter to her job at Old Navy's corporate offices that is a block away from the arena. She plans to leave early Friday night to avoid the traffic chaos, not confident that encouraging free rides on Muni will help. There is already not a lot of parking for most of the people who work here. They've had to come up with alternatives, to get to work, because they can't park here and the bus system... we will see how much it can really carry, says Glover.Some other options are to use the ferry, which drops off near Chase Center, or to come by bike.

To Wisner, St. Lawrence s 3-0 loss to Syracuse on Feb. 4, 2014 at War Memorial Arena was more than just the first-ever meeting between the two programs it was the first battle of long-time friends, former co-workers and between a coach and the coached. The coach, Syracuse s Paul Flanagan, was born and raised in Canton, New York, home of St. Lawrence. He played for the Saints, then became assistant coach of the men s team, eventually taking over the women s program from 1999-2008. He went to four straight Frozen Fours, won a school-record 31 games in the 2005-06 season and became one of the most successful women s college hockey coaches of all time. Then, in 2008, he left. Flanagan hasn t coached at St. Lawrence for over a decade, but his legacy remains. When St. Lawrence 4-4-3, 1-1-1 Eastern College Athletic comes to War Memorial Arena on Saturday for another match against Syracuse 2-10, 1-1 College Hockey America , friends, former co-workers and past players will once again face off. There s so many generations of both men s and women s players that have had a Paul Flanagan connection, Mare MacDougall, a St. Lawrence assistant said. Flanagan got his start as a hockey coach at Canton High School in the 1980s, coaching teenagers such as Chris Wells and Wisner who now make up two-thirds of the St. Lawrence coaching staff. Wells played under Flanagan again when Flanagan became the men s assistant at St. Lawrence, and even filled his role when Flanagan moved to the women s team in 1999. When Flanagan decided to take on the new challenge of starting a Syracuse women s hockey program from scratch, Wells once again filled his role. Initially, Flanagan s decision to come to Syracuse shocked some members of his coaching staff, such as MacDougall, who took the St. Lawrence assistant job in 2007 because of the opportunity to work alongside Flanagan. However, sitting on the shoulder of a Toronto highway during a recruiting trip, she learned of Flanagan s decision. The initial sting of it, MacDougall said. Oh my gosh, I only got to work with him for one year. Eva Suppa Digital Design Editor Just a day after Flanagan took the Syracuse job, fellow Canton native Wells was hired as his replacement. Wells said he was molded, in part, by every hockey coach he s ever had, from Flanagan to broadcaster Pierre McGuire, but his high school coach and college assistant taught him when to turn it on and when to turn it off. The biggest thing Wells learned from Flanagan was to serve the program and community, not for acknowledgement, but because you want to do it, he said. You ll never hear Wellsy say my team , MacDougall said. It s always us, our. Like Flanagan, Wells is a players-first coach, said Wisner. Wells has replicated Flanagan s tendency to let the players in the locker room dictate the program s culture, MacDougall said. I d like to think that there s still a little bit of part of me still there, Flanagan said. Just in the fact that I m so close to Wellsy, Boomer Wisner and Mare. You know, at times it feels like you never really left the place. But Flanagan did leave, and now his former and current team compete against each other both on and off the ice. Sharing a similar recruiting base, Wisner often sees Flanagan at rinks across the United States and Canada, where each program wins some battles, he said, but the friendship they have transcends the business side of the sport. On recruiting trips, they ll often share hotel rooms. When they play against each other, they ll often give each other postgame dinner recommendations. For MacDougall, playing Syracuse is a chance to prove that St. Lawrence is in good hands since Flanagan s departure. Karleigh Merritt-Henry Digital Design Editor Flanagan s legacy lives on with the coaching staff he coached worked alongside, but also lives in their program s record books. In 2018, Flanagan was inducted as a Legend of Appleton, celebrating his impact as a coach and player. The women s program s 100-point club is also named in honor of him. While introducing Flanagan during the award ceremony, Wells brought out a t-shirt he had received during Flanagan s bachelor party to soften the crowd. But it was Flanagan who got the last laugh. Wells had given no thought to the color of tie he was wearing, but Flanagan was quick to point out that Wells orange tie may be signalling his habit of following in Flanagan s footsteps, whether it be as men s assistant or women s head coach, might not be over. We always joke about it, Wells said. But I m quite happy where I am right now. Under Wells, the Saints have not been able to return to the Frozen Four, or complete Flanagan s biggest regret about his time at St. Lawrence not winning a national championship. But if any coach is able to bring the title to St. Lawrence, Flanagan s impact on his hometown program is undeniable. I think anyone who talks about St. Lawrence women s hockey talks about not only what we re trying to do now, Wisner said, But where the program has been in the past. He s always going to have his name on the program.

When Kyle Crutchmer wrapped up his collegiate wrestling career at the esteemed Oklahoma State University, he went through a courting process. With the MMA world waiting for him, the standout wrestler from Oklahoma already had spent some time helping train former UFC welterweight champion Johny Hendricks. He knew he d have virtually as many options as he wanted for where to set up shop to start his own MMA career. Two of the teams that vied to get him as a member were Team Alpha Male in Sacramento, Calif. and American Kickboxing Academy, not far away in San Jose. Both camps have standout wrestlers in the ranks. Crutchmer first spent some time at Alpha Male, which was founded by former WEC champ and several-time UFC title challenger Urijah Faber. But it was while he was riding in a car with Faber through Sacramento that Crutchmer found himself in a bit of an awkward situation. With Faber at the wheel, Crutchmer s phone rang. It was Daniel Cormier, the former two-division UFC champion and fellow Oklahoma State wrestling alum who also is the head wrestling coach at AKA. In the video above, Crutchmer breaks down what happened on that call and why he ultimately decided AKA was the best fit for him on the front end of his pro career. On Friday, Crutchmer 4-0 MMA, 0-0 BMMA makes his big-league MMA debut at Bellator 233 against short-notice opponent Robert Gidron 4-3 MMA, 0-0 BMMA .

Last November, she earned the coveted pro card in Singapore. Last year, there were only 89 of those cards given out worldwide last year.

It s a huge reward, said Guzm n, who has had two C-sections. It s awesome that I got it. The Dinuba High graduate earned a degree in social work and education.

At 5-feet, 110 pounds, Gallardo easily develops muscle, which is why Rivas determined she d be better in the figure competition. She finished among the top 10 in the nation at a Las Vegas competition in one of her first competitions. It got me hooked, said Gallardo, a 2006 graduate of Dinuba High.

The Coachella music festival in Indio, California, southeast of Los Angeles, has built a brand that revolves as much around supermodels, celebrities and Instagram posts as it does the performers who grace the stage. The Mountain Jam festival, held for years at Hunter Mountain in the Catskills, developed a reputation for jambands, building a fanbase with roots in improvisational music. In a crowded landscape, the strength of a festival's brand can determine its success. It's a lesson that dates back to 1969, and the Woodstock Music and Art Fest's reputation for peace, love and music. But, Woodstock's brand, as iconic as it is, has seen its share of failure. And its most recent attempt, Woodstock 50, a long-awaited celebration of the brand's golden anniversary, never made it out of the starting gate. It followed two festivals, Woodstock '94 and Woodstock '99, marked by problems, and a failed attempt to hold a free Woodstock celebration in 2009. Tim Calkins, a clinical professor of marketing who teaches and studies global branding at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, was uncertain that, given the twists and turns of Woodstock 50, the Woodstock festival could maintain its brand. The challenge for any brand is, you want to remain relevant, Calkins said. The challenge for Woodstock is that now it has this incredible history but has struggled to keep that compelling for people today. The cancellation just enhances the perception of Woodstock as a brand that had a lot meaning but maybe has less meaning today. Calkins added, If you're a performer, a promoter, a local government official, you're going to look at anyone who shows up with the Woodstock brand with a bit of a skeptical eye. It's going to be tough to get another big event off the ground. Robert Weitzner, a professor in the Drexel University Music Industry Program, wasn't so sure of that. Woodstock is a brand that has sort of taken on its own cultural significance of a particular time and place and mentality about the youth and some level of peace, love and harmony, he said. All of these things are still in existence and are physical manifestations of Woodstock. He added, I don t think we should conflate the failure of a business proposal to signify the demise of an important cultural brand....I don't think this necessarily undermines Woodstock's place in the world.

The company has set itself four moonshot goals to make good on this promise Advancing sustainability, cultivating inclusion, transforming lives, and upholding ethics and privacy. The moonshot goals fall under the company's 2030 Progress Made Real plan and are grounded in the belief that technology and data combined with human spirit are, and will always be, positive forces in the world . By 2030, Dell Technologies is aiming to recycle an equivalent product for every product a customer buys have more than half of all product content made from recycled or renewable material and use 100 recycled or renewable material in all packaging. So what you can envisage this relationship we've created, this kind of circular relationship, circular economy with our customers, Dell Technologies vice president of sustainability David Lear told media during the Dell Technologies Summit in Austin on Tuesday. We think that's really important because that's really the concept here of us thinking about intentionally designing our products knowing we're going to get it back some day. In fact, if you look over the last 10 years, that's exactly what we've been doing. We want to grow that significantly. We recognise electronics waste is growing very fast it's one of the fastest-growing waste streams in the world right now and we want to be part of the solution, not part of the problem. See also Dell Tech Summit Want to help the environment. Start with your company culture TechRepublic Lear said that over 50 million tonnes of electronic waste was last year entered into commerce -- 4,500 Eiffel Towers worth. This is our motivation, saying, 'we're putting stuff out there, how do we get it back.', he said. We're doing it today, but we want to do it at a greater percentage. One such example of this is in the shipping of servers with a server tote on the horizon. It's a packaging tote for our big server products, Lear said. You're probably thinking a big tote for a server. What's cool about it is that it can hold 40 1U servers, so it's a pretty big device, but it's reusable, something we can actually send to our customer, they can use it, and they can send it back. The tote is touted as a multi-pack for large enterprise customers buying a lot of PowerEdge Servers -- up to 41U. It will get picked up at the Dell Technologies factory and shipped to a customer's data centre, and then collected again by the company. According to Lear, just using this device is going to save over 500 pounds of unnecessary waste packaging every time it ships 40 servers. It's also going to allow us to ship more per truck, so it's going to reduce the amount of carbon, and we think it's just going to be a great solution and innovation across the industry, he said. Early next year Dell Technologies will begin to run a tote pilot with a few of its customers. Image Dell Technologies Lear also touched on the new Latitude 7300 80. We're especially proud of this, because this integrates a lot of cool features and it's going to come packaged in recycled ocean plastics, he said. One innovation that we've been working on for a couple of years is this concept of reclaimed carbon fibre. Carbon fibre is not something you think about in a computer, but it's actually very popular in the aerospace industry. We found that they were taking a lot of their trash material and throwing it away. As a result, Dell Technologies partnered with a company based in South Carolina that helps convert the waste material into something that can be integrated into its products.

Under its cultivate inclusion goal, Dell Technologies is planning on hiring, developing, and retaining the number of women that are employed so they account for 50 of the company's global workforce and 40 of management. Dell will also have 25 of the company's US workforce assumed by African American and Hispanic team members. The company also aims to annually educate 95 of all team members about unconscious bias, harassment, microaggressions, and privilege It also wants to advance the health, education, and economic opportunity of 1 billion people digitally transform 1,000 non-profit organisations and achieve 75 team member participation in charity or volunteer-related activities. In addition, where privacy and transparency is concerned, Dell Technologies hopes to fully-automate data control processes, in a move it said will make it easier for customers to access, delete, or share their personal data. Every one of these areas really matters, Dell Technologies EVP and chief customer officer Karen Quintos said. We're committed to make a difference. If you don't change the culture, you're not going to change anything. Asha Barbaschow travelled to Dell Technologies Summit as a guest of Dell Technologies.

A world-renowned entertainment review aggregator, the Tomatometer reflects the collective opinion of thousands of Tomatometer-approved critics. Each Tomatometer score represents the percentage of positive reviews for a given film or television show. Rotten Tomatoes' revamped criteria have an increased focus on the critic's individual qualifications and body of work, rather than basing Tomatometer approval primarily on their publication or employer. This strategy will allow for a wider and more diverse pool of critics' perspectives to be included in the Tomatometer. In addition, the criteria have expanded beyond the written review to include newer media platforms. Now individuals and outlets that produce reviews for podcasts and digital video series with a strong social media presence and audience engagement will be considered for the Tomatometer. Most recently, over 200 new Tomatometer-approved critics have been added with many more to come. The criteria can be found on the Rotten Tomatoes site, along with an application to become a Tomatometer-approved critic. Over the past few years, our team has added hundreds of new voices to the Tomatometer on top of the thousands we currently have, with the goal of creating a critics pool that closely reflects the global entertainment audience, said Jenny Jediny, Rotten Tomatoes critics relations manager. We took another key step today by revamping our critics criteria that both shifts our focus to approving critics individually rather than through publications, and introduces updated guidelines for newer media platforms to be a part of the Tomatometer. To help critics gain access to key film festivals, Rotten Tomatoes has established a 100,000 grant program. Over the next year, Rotten Tomatoes will provide grants to non-profit organizations that help critics with costly expenses associated with festival attendance. The first grant of 25,000 will go to the Toronto International Film Festival's Media Inclusion Initiative, which will help the organization bring almost 200 new journalists serving underrepresented groups to the Festival, running September 6-16, 2018. Rotten Tomatoes plays an important role in connecting fans with trusted information and recommendations on what to watch in theaters and at home, said Paul Yanover, president of Fandango, Rotten Tomatoes' parent company. Advancing inclusion in criticism continues to be a priority for Rotten Tomatoes and we plan to expand our work with media outlets that hire critics, film festivals and other groups, so as an industry we can better serve consumers. In an effort to help foster the next generation of film critics and entertainment journalists, the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism and Rotten Tomatoes announced earlier this month the second recipient of the Rotten Tomatoes Fellowship in Digital Innovation and Entertainment Criticism, for academic year 2018-19. Graduate student Sophie-Marie Prime, who recently received an undergraduate degree in film and media studies at University of California, Berkley received this year's fellowship. Established in 2017, the multi-year graduate fellowship combines academic coursework from USC Annenberg and USC's six art schools with on-site experience working at Rotten Tomatoes. Students gain tuition support and professional experience working with Rotten Tomatoes' editorial staff and leaders, across its online, mobile and social platforms. Today marks the first phase of Rotten Tomatoes' new enhancements to its Tomatometer rating system, designed to better serve audiences around the world with their entertainment viewing decisions. New critics will be spotlighted on the Tomatometer Critics home page, so that entertainment fans can discover new voices in criticism from a variety of backgrounds and platforms. Rotten Tomatoes plans to introduce more new product features over the next year to deliver even more value to fans. About Rotten Tomatoes Rotten Tomatoes and the Tomatometer score are the world's most trusted recommendation resources for quality entertainment. As the leading online aggregator of movie and TV show reviews from thousands of critics, Rotten Tomatoes provides fans with a comprehensive guide to what's Fresh and what's Rotten in theaters and at home. And the Tomatometer is just the beginning. Rotten Tomatoes serves movie and TV fans with original editorial content on its site and social channels, produces fun and informative video series, and holds live events for fans across the country, with its 'Your Opinion Sucks' live shows.

The bar and eatery, located at 840 S. Fairfax Ave., closed after St. Patrick s Day last year. Brothers David and Francis Castagnetti, the operators of the newly reopened Bergin s, said their soft opening began with friends and family on Dec. 12 and 13, and the general public was welcomed on Saturday, Dec. 14. It was busy all night long, David Castagnetti said. For now, Tom Bergin s is open from 5 p.m. to midnight on Monday and Thursday, from 5 p.m. to 2 a.m. on Friday and Saturday, and 11 a.m. to midnight on Sunday. Bergin s is closed on Tuesday and Wednesday, though the Castagnettis said that is likely to change in the next 30 to 45 days, in which the restaurant will be open seven days a week. The Castagnettis, who previously ran Firefly in Studio City and Union in Pasadena, said they were honored to be picked to reopen the famed eatery, which has been a popular watering hole since it opened in 1936. Bergin s moved to the Fairfax location in 1949, where it was frequented by notable figures like actor Cary Grant and President Ronald Reagan. The Castagnettis said they have great respect for the history of Bergin s, and when they moved to Los Angeles in the early 2000s, both brothers homes were nearby, as was that of their mother, who lived in Park La Brea. This was our hood for a long, long time, Francis Castagnetti said. The Castagnettis came aboard to operate the pub in late August, and the only changes they ve made were to rehang some of the artwork that had been taken down and to clean up the space. We left the bones exactly the same For us, there s no ego involved in this. Look at all these shamrocks. This was someone s neighborhood spot for almost 100 years. We didn t want to take that away from anyone, Francis Castagnetti said. The operators, however, do not own the bar, and they declined to name the new owner of Bergin s. Former Bergin s owner Derek Schreck said he sold the business to a company called 840 Fairfax LLC at the end of June. According to the Los Angeles County Assessor s records, the property was sold on June 26 for 4.6 million. The Castagnettis said Schreck has been very supportive of the business s reopening. Derek has been unbelievably supportive and helpful he s been great to us, Francis Castagnetti said. Schreck added that he s rooting for the new operators success. I m delighted that Bergin s is reopening. I never wanted Bergin s to go away. It just was not a tenable business when I had it, and these guys are really good operators. Hopefully, with renewed community support and their own insight into how they feel Bergin s can move forward, they ll be successful. I m really excited for them, Schreck said. The Castagnettis said the neighborhood has also been very supportive, and Ken Hixon, senior vice president of Miracle Mile Residential Association, said the new team at Bergin s has enormous goodwill behind them for their attempt to resurrect a beloved community establishment after the building was declared a historic-cultural monument by the Los Angeles City Council in June. We re absolutely delighted. This was the whole point of working so hard to achieve landmark status for the property, Hixon said. However, Hixon noted concern about the results of what he described as a Solomon decision in June the Bergin s parking lot was excluded from historic-cultural monument protections so that housing might one day be built on it. In plans filed with the city earlier this month, applicant Chris Clifford proposed a 209-apartment project called 800 South Fairfax to replace both of the two-story apartment buildings that are immediately north of Bergin s. Clifford s listed representative, attorney Todd Nelson of Armbruster Goldsmith Delvac, did not respond to requests for comment. It s wildly out of scale for anything on Fairfax. It s over the top in any sense of the word, Hixon said. The two existing buildings contain 40 units, documents filed with the city show, and Hixon said it s important that the residents of those apartments, which are rent-stabilized, be protected. Of the 209 units planned for the new development, Clifford s plans show that 28 will be set aside for extremely low-income tenants. We re working with the tenants of those buildings to do everything we can to make sure they know their rights and they have all the information they need, Hixon said. The Castagnettis said they have no association with any planned developments nearby and were reticent to comment on any potential development in the area. However, David Castagnetti noted that Bergin s is a neighborhood bar at its heart. So if the neighborhood grows, and there s more of an audience for it to be a neighborhood bar that s a great thing, David Castagnetti said. In the short term, the Castagnettis said they are working to get the restaurant back on its feet. They ve hired a team of 10 to 15 people who can help the cultural institution thrive. A place like this at the end of the day, it kind of belongs to the city, David Castagnetti said.", "title": "Thank your lucky shamrock \u2013 Bergin\u2019s is back", "dataset": "sample", "labels": "['restaurant', 'local_neighbourhood']", "annot_city": "['Los Angeles']"}, {"id": 566, "city": "chicago", "url": "https://www.staradvertiser.com/2019/12/04/breaking-news/kauai-police-double-down-on-no-shave-november/", "text": "After participating in No-Shave November to raise funds for the American Cancer Society of Hawaii Kauai Branch, the Kauai Police Department is looking to continue doing so during Double-Down December.

Victoria even held her own game in hopes that Spider and Victor would show, but that plan didn t work out. Back in Genoa City, Victoria knows that Victor lied to her about being off the continent for business. Brandon sent her a picture of Victor in a bar in Las Vegas. She cannot figure out what Victor s secret is, and even though she promised Billy no more searching for Spider, Victoria continues working on figuring out what is happening with her father. When Nick Joshua Morrow stopped by, Victoria showed him the picture, and Nick didn t recognize Spider either. Victoria s insistence in finding out what Victor is hiding won t sit well with Billy. Plus, Billy has his own family drama happening with Jack Peter Bergman and Ashley Eileen Davidson fighting over Jabot.

The strength and resilience of these young people is inspiring, New York Deputy Mayor Herminia Palacio said in a news release. And it is this same strength and resilience that has prepared them for anything and will propel them forward as they join our next generation of future leaders.

Lawrence s father, Henry, is a chef for a local hospital but was forced to move the family into a homeless shelter when their rent rose. They re homeless because of the economics, the gap between rents and income, NYC Social Services Commissioner Steven Banks told WABC. Data shows that 114,658 students are homeless in New York City, according to the New York State Technical and Education Assistance Center for Homeless Students. With 1.1 million students attending schools in the city, that means 1 in 10 is homeless, enough to fill Yankee Stadium twice, the group says.

Four scholarship freshmen. All potential Duke basketball stars. No clear-cut favorite. In this regard, though not quite as collectively high on recruiting rankings, the primary question about this year's class is the same one folks asked about a former four-man class in Durham. Leading up to the 1997-98 season, fans nor rankings could agree on who would be the top weapons among freshmen Elton Brand, Shane Battier, William Avery, and Chris Burgess. Once the season began, on the other hand, it didn't take long to at least find out which one was the most overrated in high school sorry, Burgess . The 247Sports Composite says the order of Duke's 2019 talents is as follows center Vernon Carey Jr. No. 6 , power forward Matthew Hurt No. 12 , small forward Wendell Moore No. 29 , and shooting guard Cassius Stanley No. 37 . A Twitter poll this week from The Chronicle, though, says in terms of excitement level for each freshman, fans -- at least those who follow the student newspaper's Duke basketball account -- see the order much differently than the rankings Stanley 35 percent of the 1,788 votes , Hurt 28 percent , Carey Jr. 23 percent , and Moore 14 percent . With move-in day less than 24 hours away, which incoming DukeMBB freshman are you most excited to see on the court. Duke Basketball dukebasketball August 19, 2019 Granted, the aerial style of Stanley screams excitement. But fans would have little to be excited about if they didn't believe the 6-foot-6, 195-pounder out of Los Angeles would play significant minutes. ALSO READ Cassius Stanley drops the hammer on NBA All-Stars And seeing that Moore is almost all substance -- with only a sprinkling of flash -- and younger fans typically enjoy high-powered offense more than defense and dirty work, it's not too much of a shock the 6-foot-6, 215-pound North Carolinian moves the excitement needle less than his fellow newbies. Another takeaway from the poll is fans may be underestimating the joy they'll find from watching Hurt as the 6-foot-9, 215-pound Minnesota native drops buckets from nearly every spot on the floor with his quick, pillowy release. Finally, fans may also be underestimating the sheer size and force of Carey Jr. -- a 6-foot-10, 275-pound Floridian -- not to mention the potential giggles from seeing his bruiser look and personality intimidate opponents.

The ruling could potentially cost the Florida Department of Corrections as much 20 million more than what it is already paying to treat inmates with the virus, said Senate Criminal and Civil Justice Appropriations Chairman Jeff Brandes, who recently got a preliminary briefing from the department on the issue. While the state was already mandated by the court to treat inmates with Hepatitis C, the ruling by U.S. District Judge Mark Walker expanded the number of inmates who will receive care because it includes those who are at the early stages of the disease. The order will affect roughly 20,000 to 40,000 prisoners, according to the Florida Justice Institute, which sued the state in 2017 after inmates said they had been denied proper hepatitis C treatment. As a result of this order, thousands of people will be treated for hepatitis C and will no longer be at risk for cancer, liver disease and premature death, said Dante P. Trevisani, executive director of the Florida Justice Institute. The state admitted in court that it failed to provide inmates with proper hepatitis C treatment, something the state knew to be a serious medical need, in part because of a lack of funding, according to Thursday s ruling. FDC The Florida Department of Corrections has come a long way, Walker wrote. But FDC s improvement does not mean that it is no longer being deliberately indifferent to HCV-infected inmates, nor does it mean that there is no risk of such deliberate indifference reoccurring in the future. The ruling is expected to further strain the corrections system budget, and with two weeks left in the legislative session, time is running out to negotiate more money for the department. The question is, is it better to put a little bit more money in this year and begin to chip away at that. Brandes, R-St. Petersburg, said. There s a lot of different ways we could do this. Michelle Glady, a Department of Corrections spokeswoman, said the agency is committed to ensuring all inmates in its custody, roughly 98,000, receive the medically necessary treatment that is in line with national standards and our constitutional responsibilities. The costs to taxpayers remains unclear, but the agency s latest budget request submitted before the final court order asked for 36.9 million to treat inmates infected with Hepatitis C. That did not include money for inmates in the earlier stages of the disease. The order does expand the number of inmates that will require treatment, but we are still in the process of reviewing the order and it is too soon to project additional funding needs, Glady said. The department uses a variety of medication brands, and the treatment for each inmate infected by hepatitis C also varies, so the cost of treatment per inmate is handled on a case-by-case basis, Glady said. As budget negotiations move forward before the scheduled May 3 end of the session, Brandes said the Senate will determine what to do after prison officials pinpoint funding needs. Rep. Clay Yarborough, a Jacksonville Republican who chairs the House Justice Appropriations Subcommittee, said his staff is also looking at the fiscal impact of the court order. As health care drives up costs in the prison system, the department faces budgetary constraints in other areas. After Hurricane Michael hit Northwest Florida, prison facilities racked up structural damage of at least 30 million. Since the start of session, Brandes has been sounding the alarm about the department being in crisis, arguing that the system is now a health-care provider that houses inmates. There s a lack of education and transition programs because of the enormity of money we are spending on health care, Brandes said.", "title": "Hepatitis C ruling adds to prison health tab", "dataset": "sample", "labels": "['inter_national_politics']", "annot_city": "[]"}, {"id": 579, "city": "seattle", "url": "https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/washington/articles/2019-10-15/sequim-woman-held-on-1m-bail-in-neighbors-death", "text": "SEQUIM, Wash.

In the span of just a few weeks, a handful of new businesses have either opened or announced plans at rate somewhat higher than the last couple of years, and just about all of it is in the downtown s Main Street corridor. City officials said they didn t have a more recent inventory of what was empty in the downtown area. But a short Times Herald survey of storefronts showed there were slightly more than 10 vacancies along Military Street and Huron Avenue out of well more than 100 businesses. Where we were in the old days where every other building was empty, we re not as nervous that the businesses are going out more than they re coming in, said David Haynes, the city s planning director. Downtown Development Authority Director Natalie Watson was immediately available for comment Friday, but Haynes said his office does try to keep a thumbnail of where we re at with spaces available around areas like the downtown and the Port Huron industrial park. Anecdotally, we ve seen a lot of storefronts come in, especially on the retail side, he said. It seems like a retail resurgence. They re clustering their businesses intentionally Before Patrick and James opened earlier this month, Manager Eddie Brennan, who s running the menswear store for owners Charitie Pruitt and Brian Patrick, talked about his excitement to be a part of what he called an ongoing downtown explosion. He also cited the welcoming downtown business community as a big bonus. But right where the new clothing store is located at 225 Huron Ave., there have been several other retail stores in the works and in an area of downtown already heavier with that kind of storefront. Across the street is Ruboo Boutique, a women s clothing store at 230 Huron Ave. Immediately next door, there are small displays teasing passers-by about the coming of another store where newly appointed county commissioner Jorja Baldwin s family plans to open a shoe store, dubbed District No. 43, by the end of the summer. Elsewhere in that area of downtown are other established stores Suzanne s, a women s clothing store at 325 Huron Ave., and the Papaya Branch Boutique, located close off Superior Mall running parallel to the same retail line. In all, there are two dozen retail-related stores in the works or already open on Main Street. Baldwin said she s seen a lot of public-private partnership in local government. And she said it s an attitude she s seeing the business community beginning to adopt. You see one business owner who is really excited about the resurgence of downtown and then can see the gap in what s available and reaches out to people and says, Hey, you know what would be really great. You should open a men s clothing store. You know what we re really missing. We re missing a shoe store, Baldwin said. And then working together between the EDA programs and things with Matt Brooks and everything he s doing at the Roost, there s a whole subsection of small business owners and entrepreneurs who are also doing that same thing and working together. It s not by accident that Ed Brennan and me and Laura Lyon from Papaya, we ve known each other for more than 30 years, so we start talking to people about what can we do and what sort of changes and impact can we make, and can we do it together. City officials, too, credit that relationship. What I think s remarkable, the resurgence of downtown is not government driven, said City Manager James Freed. It s driven by entrepreneurs downtown. They re clustering their businesses intentionally to build a sense of destination. It stands on the service of those that came first the restaurants and the lofts. 'Something greater than it was' Another boutique, MI Passion, 217 Huron Ave., was slated to have its grand opening Saturday. Owner Anita Varty had talked about her own sense of welcoming to the downtown community earlier in the week. They are so excited about all the new stores coming in, she said. There s great energy down here. Everybody s glad to see downtown coming back. But the shift in new businesses activity isn t just north of the Black River. Off of Military Street, the CityFlats Hotel has opened its second restaurant with the Fair Weather Grill and debuted its upscale ballroom. And down the road, a developer is breathing life back into the Hotel Harrington. It s also more than just new businesses it s established ones filling vacant space. The local Christian radio station 90.7 Hope FM and Power 88.3 announced in January they were moving from their Port Huron Township home into 908 Military St., and Cedar Hill Graphics has settled into the building, 912 Military St., after purchasing it last year. Weekends in the City, which had occupied the latter, has additionally settled into their CityFlats home off Water Street. Another vacancy at 916 Military St., which was renovated by its owner last year, has also been recently filled. All Rise Tattoo opened this month, and owner Brian Lariccia said their move from the city s north end was fulfilling a larger dream to be downtown. And to be part of the continued growth. The first time I drove down through here, which was roughly about 10 years ago, I just saw the potential of what Port Huron could ve been, Lariccia said. Being a port town, being a border town, having this historical district, having that culture and that flavor, it felt like all the places I lived in when I lived in Chicago and knowing Main Street America, I felt Port Huron just needed to be something greater than it was. And that I could contribute to that somehow. That was just a brief, fleeting thought. Varty said she thought the energy would be beneficial to her new boutique, as well as the rest of the businesses downtown. The foot traffic down here has been wonderful, she said. With me being here, I see people going by. I see people pointing and looking and trying to get in. Although there are another handful of vacancies off Military and Huron, local business officials said they re still glad to see so much along the primary corridor. Haynes said he thought it was about having the right mix of businesses downtown with the right hours to ensure there are daytime businesses but also reasons to be in the area on nights and weekends. While there are 17 restaurants and bars down Huron and Military, there are also seven salons, three auto shops, and two dozen attorney, financial services, and architect and engineering firm offices. You like to see more on the restaurant and retail side, he said. More of that concentration, the more energy you have in the downtown. Contact Jackie Smith at 810 989-6270 or jssmith gannett.com.

According to the Cincinnati Business Courier, the quarter-billion-dollar project will refurbish nearly the entire 14-acre Clifton Campus of the UC Health s campus to make it more up-to-date and allow for greater medical care in Cincinnati s Uptown neighborhood. Larger operating rooms with state-of-the-art equipment are planned, as well as renovations to the emergency department and a buildout of new garages and two new medical buildings as well. Many of the buildings on the campus are a half-century or even 100 years old. This project marks the first phase of a long-term plan to modernize the entire healthcare campus, with the Cincinnati Business Courier reporting that this will entail renovating and expanding 17 buildings encompassing 1.7 million square feet of healthcare space. CEO of UC Health Dr. Rick Lofgren was quoted in the Business Courier report as saying that the 221 million project will fundamentally change the campus as part of UC Health s mission to transform itself into a cutting-edge healthcare provider. Furthermore, Lofgren said his organization must look to its immediate future as well as the city s long-term needs to be able to assist with Cincinnati s healthcare sector. The lion s share of the budget will be needed to upgrade the 35,000-square-foot emergency department, which was designed and built in the late 1980s. The UC Medical Center s emergency department saw over 120,000 visits for trauma in 2019 alone, the Business Courier reported, and the ER often runs at or near capacity. The expansion and renovation of the emergency department will cost 110 million, and a flexible intensive care unit will also be constructed adjacent to the main ER as well. An additional 41,000 square feet of space next to the emergency department will be constructed on empty land, but this will require demolishing the 1910-built UC Medical Center B Pavilion to make room for the new facility. This will enable better ease of transport and patient flow between the two spaces. An additional three-story building will also be constructed, at a cost of 40 million. In this building, eight additional operating rooms and other clinical support space will be built out. This new building necessitates the demolition of the existing Radiology Administrative Building and the Old Operating Pavilion. The full renovation is expected to be completed in 2025. The UC Medical Center is the third-largest in Cincinnati and, according to the Business Courier, employs over 10,000 staff members, nearly a thousand UC Health physicians and hundreds of residents and fellows.

Chara s face was bloodied when he was struck by the puck Monday in Boston s 4-2 loss at St. Louis. Nothing new, Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy told reporters Tuesday morning before the team returned to Boston. Obviously, he s got to get back to Boston and get looked at a little closer and we ll go from there. Chara was injured by the deflected puck early in the second period, and he did not return to the ice. He did rejoin the bench in the third period, lending support to his teammates while wearing a full shield on his helmet and despite being very uncomfortable, according to Cassidy. He s an absolute warrior, Bruins forward Brad Marchand told NHL.com. I think if it wasn t for the doctor, he would have played in that game. He s that kind of guy. You re gonna have to kill him to keep him off. He s an absolute leader. In addition to being the Bruins best penalty-killer, Chara has contributed one goal and four assists in 20 games this postseason. Chara missed 20 games during the regular season with a knee injury, so the team has experience playing without its 6-foot-9 captain. We know we can win with guys out of the lineup, it s just the magnitude of the time of the year, Cassidy said. This matchup is not good with Zee out, let s face it.

Announced Dec. 16 by Chancellor Ronnie Green, the appointment is effective Jan. 3. Counley will replace Tami Strickman, who has been named associate vice president for institutional equity at the University of Michigan. Tami Strickman Strickman has served as associate to the chancellor for equity and compliance as well as the university s Title IX coordinator since 2016. Prior to coming to Nebraska, Strickman worked for 14 years as a prosecutor in Chicago, specializing in sex crimes, domestic violence and juvenile justice. Tami has been an invaluable member of our leadership team, providing necessary guidance regarding highly sensitive issues, Green said. She brings an incredible depth of knowledge and professionalism to the table. I m sad to have Tami leave Nebraska, but I look forward to watching her help a Big Ten colleague build momentum toward greater inclusivity. Strickman is making the move to be closer to family and for the opportunity to lead Michigan s recent investment into and reconfiguration of its Office of Institutional Equity. My work at Nebraska has been an incredibly rewarding experience, but it s time for me to take on new challenges, Strickman said. Chancellor Green and other university leaders have been extremely supportive. Any successes we ve had in my tenure are directly tied to their commitment to creating an inclusive and safe environment on campus. Nebraska s leader of institutional equity and compliance is responsible for all matters involving allegations of discrimination under Title VI and VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the American Disabilities Act, and Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972. During her tenure, Strickman expanded the Office of Institutional Equity and Compliance staffing. She also served on the chancellor s diversity committee and the University of Nebraska system s compliance committee. Counley has served as the university s deputy Title IX coordinator and as a senior investigator since 2016. She received her bachelor s and master s degrees in criminal justice from Washburn University in Topeka, Kansas. Meagan s experience on campus and in law enforcement is a good mix to step into this expanded role, Green said. I m thankful for her willingness to lead our Title IX office. Counley began her career in law enforcement in 2011 with the Lawrence Police Department in Lawrence, Kansas. Her law enforcement career included assignments to patrol and juvenile investigations. I am looking forward to working closer with university leadership during the search for a new associate to the chancellor for equity and compliance, Counley said.

AP The theater staging a play about the notorious late Mayor Vincent Buddy Cianci says it has raised just 500 for the charity bearing his name, while collecting donations during the show's sold-out run. Trinity Repertory Company is raising money for the educational foundation during The Prince of Providence , with solicitations in programs, collection buckets at the door nightly and Cianci's own pasta sauce for sale. These efforts had raised about 500 as of Friday, the theater said. Cianci established a college scholarship fund for Providence school children in 1994, during his second stint in office and before he was sent to prison in 2002 for presiding over widespread corruption in City Hall. An Associated Press examination in 2014 found the charity had amassed hundreds of thousands of dollars, but gave out just a few thousand per year in grants and spent most of its money on expenses other than scholarships. Cianci said then they were building the fund so it continues making money. Cianci's charities were overhauled after he died in January 2016, merging into the Cianci Educational Foundation. The theater says it didn't seek or receive any assurances from the foundation that it's being run well today, or have any concerns. The play, which premiered Sept. 12, was extended due to its popularity and ends Sunday. Cianci's nephew, Brad Turchetta, had hoped the theater would raise more for the foundation. By comparison, Turchetta said, the Graduate Hotel in Providence removed portraits of Cianci in response to a complaint about his criminal history and sold them, raising roughly 15,000 to 20,000 for the foundation's scholarships. Turchetta, the foundation's executor, said Trinity offered to fundraise after some of Cianci's relatives and friends publicly complained when it was announced in March that The Prince of Providence would be inspired by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Mike Stanton's biography of the same name. They think the book is inaccurate and felt Cianci's memoir would've been a better choice. Turchetta said the foundation is run differently now, with a board that distributed more than 20,000 last year in scholarships and follows the law regarding how much money raised needs to be given out. There was a board before, but mainly Cianci ran it, he added. Turchetta said Friday he'd give the AP a recent tax form showing the changes, but hadn't done so by Tuesday. The most recent publicly available tax form covers the scholarship fund in 2015, prior to the merger. It shows nearly 55 of the disbursements were for contributions and gifts and about 45 was spent on operating and administrative expenses. The largest gift listed went to the commerce association in Providence's Federal Hill neighborhood, which Cianci often frequented. Charity evaluators look for at least 65 of disbursements to be spent on contributions, said Christopher Ryan Jr., an expert on trusts who teaches at Roger Williams University School of Law in Bristol, Rhode Island. For years, no money from the Mayor's Own Marinara Sauce was donated to the scholarship fund. A Cianci adviser told the AP in 2014 the sauce made 3 in income in total from 2009 to 2012. Turchetta said the sauce now provides several hundred dollars for the foundation monthly. Cianci was known for his colorful TV appearances and publicity stunts touting Providence and himself. He was forced from office twice due to felonies. Cianci reinvented himself as the host of a popular radio talk show before attempting a comeback bid in 2014. Caitlin Howle, a spokeswoman for Trinity, said the theater thought the fundraising would recognize the positive elements of Buddy's legacy. Stanton said he wasn't consulted about fundraising and he dismissed criticism of his book Monday, saying it's fair and accurate and of course Cianci partisans aren't going to like it. M. Charles Bakst, a retired political columnist for The Providence Journal, didn't donate when he saw the play. Bakst didn't mind the fundraising though, since donating was optional. It would've given him pause if proceeds from ticket sales went to the foundation. The AP's past reporting about Cianci's scholarship fund was jolting, Bakst said. Still, he was surprised more wasn't collected. A decent number of people who went to that show were fans of his and I would think they might be a little more apt to give, he said Monday. Turchetta appreciates the theater's gesture of goodwill and enjoyed seeing the play. It keeps Buddy's name in the news and at the forefront, he said. Buddy would've liked that.

Prosecutors on Tuesday filed multiple charges against two men and a woman arrested last week in the killing of Officer Juan Diaz. The 24-year-old officer was gunned down after he confronted the trio spray-painting gang graffiti near a taco stand, investigators said. Francisco Talamantes, 23, Cristian Facundo, 20 and Ashlynn Smith, 18, were tagging buildings early on July 27, Police Chief Michel Moore said at a Tuesday news conference. Advertisement At around 12 45 a.m. they tagged a sidewalk in the Lincoln Heights neighborhood where Diaz was eating tacos with three friends, Moore said. When Diaz asked them to stop, Facundo became aggressive and lifted up his shirt to display a handgun, the chief said. Diaz and his friends tried to get into a car to avoid violence, but Facundo shot into the vehicle, according to investigators. The officer and one of the other men were hit by gunfire. Diaz died from his wounds and the other man was hospitalized with critical injuries. He s now recovering at home, Moore said. After Facundo shot Diaz, the three drove to another location where they fired at an ex-boyfriend of Smith and another person but the gun malfunctioned, Moore said. Facundo and Talamantes were each charged with one count of murder and two counts of attempted murder with the special circumstance allegation of being gang members, prosecutors said. Both men and Smith each face one count of shooting at an occupied motor vehicle and vandalism. Smith also faces one count of accessory after the fact, prosecutors said. It wasn t immediately clear whether the defendants had obtained lawyers. Diaz is the second off-duty officer killed in the Los Angeles area in recent months. In June, Los Angeles County Sheriff s Deputy Joseph Gilbert Solano was shot and killed at a Jack in the Box restaurant in the suburb of Alhambra. The suspect, Rhett Nelson of Utah, is also charged in the killing of professional Russian snowboarder Dmitry Kolstov. Authorities have said that the killings of Solano and Kolstov are believed to be random. Nelson has pleaded not guilty in both cases. Diaz had been on the force for two years and was assigned to the police department s Professional Standards Bureau. The union that represents Los Angeles Police Department officers said prosecutors should seek the death penalty in the case. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, issued a moratorium on death row executions in March that granted temporary reprieves to more than 700 inmates. He said no executions would take place during his term. California has executed 13 inmates since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty in 1976. Copyright 2020 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Splice Records turns five years old this month and will celebrate with a big showcase at the Continental Club Saturday July 6, which also happens to be Brennan s birthday. I like to think of us as a Texas independent label that dabbles in production and wears quite a few hats. says Brennan. Splice started in some incarnation many years ago, Brennan and his brother would make VHS videos around the neighborhood and called them, Splice of Life Productions. He has had a lifelong interest in music, art and film but makes his bread and butter as a mortgage banker.

Kinsey explained to Brennan the details of his record deal at the time and Brennan thought, Man that deal sucks. That s it. For some reason I thought everything was done much differently and I thought, man I can do better then that. I dreamt the record label that night. says Brennan. He took some of his mortgage banker income and started Splice Records. Brennan partnered with Sarah Miller, whom he had met while volunteering at the Artery, and together they have built the Splice Records family. Shaun Brennan and the Splice Records team have a passion for helping Texas artists. says Paul Kresowik from Tomar and the FCs, a band on the label. Shaun s enthusiasm is contagious and his sincere devotion has helped their vision grow while providing support to the people he represents. From the moment I met Shaun and saw his passion for music and the local scene I knew I wanted to work with this guy. Splice has been there for us filling that void between us and our fans. says Sergio Trevino from Ancient Cat Society Splice Records represents eight artists and puts on the Bowie Elvis Festivals in Austin and Houston, an evening of music celebrating the two men who share a birthday. They also have been running the River Revival Festival for five years with each year growing its reputation as one of the best outdoor festivals in Texas. The festival features three days of camping, live music, food and beer all along the Guadalupe river. Every year they unveil the line-up at the anniversary party at Continental, and this year is no different. Brennan is confident this summer's River Revival will surpass all others, as every year he admits he has learned from his growing pains. When asked about the success behind River Revival Brennan admits, It has magic. I got lucky on this one. When you put people in the right spot and surround them with good things on a continuous basis for one great weekend in a beautiful little city, then magic really does happen. Though he maintains his day job, Brennan hopes to continue growing Splice Records. He says he finds himself constantly thinking about ways to push not only the Houston music scene, but music from all over Texas wishing he had the infrastructure to do more. This is not my hobby, this is my third child. Sometimes I think, What if I have to stop doing it. and I really don t like that thought. Sustainability is important. says Brennan. The hardest part of the job he says is when he cannot accept an artist, either because he feels it is not a good fit or they cannot offer the artist what they want. He has handpicked the bands he represents because he was first and foremost a fan. It s almost like a relationship of somebody that you fall in love with, I like to court them instead of being courted. says Brennan. It s not to deter people from doing that, because I always want to hear their music. There are so many great bands in Houston that I need to add to this label to make it more and make it more diverse too. he adds. Discussing the indescribable Houston sound and the rich musical history this city has to offer Brennan says, It s like one big gumbo of everything that s come from the Port of Houston through the years. Like everything in Houston, I feel it takes a while for it to be understood outside of the city limits, or at least accepted, and that s our greatest attribute and biggest flaw as a city. In a city that tears down buildings faster than you can say strip mall it s natural to worry about longevity, but one thing Houston has proven is that when there is real heart and soul behind something, the city shows up. The old wisdom, if you do what you love you'll be successful, verifies with Splice Records. says Splice artist Pecos' Hank Schyma. Brennan hypothesizes about the future, I don t know where we will be in ten years but if we continue to take these steps, I really feel like I ll be at a very happy place in a very difficult industry and I m willing to try.

Jon Gosselin revealed exclusively to Us Weekly that he doesn t believe he and former wife Kate Gosselin will ever be able to coparent their eight children. Kate and Jon Gosselin s Drama-Filled History The Jon and Kate Plus 8 alum, 42, opened about his family life with Kate and their twin daughters, Madelyn and Cara, 18, and sextuplets Collin, Hannah, Leah, Alexis, Aaden and Joel, 15, during David and Jackie Seigel s Victoria s Voice event held to raise awareness for America teen opioid crisis at The Westgate Hotel in Las Vegas on Friday, October 25. I don t think coparenting is ever going to exist between us because we are never going to see eye to eye, Jon explained. We have completely different parenting styles and she still wants to film, but I m never going to sign work permits. That already went to court and I won but she went against my legal rights. Jon went on to explain that while he has custody of Collin and Hannah, he rarely gets to visit his other six children and has little-to-no relationship with them due to Kate s interference. Now and Then. Take a Look at the Gosselin Family Through the Years I agree that they are my children but their mother Kate puts roadblocks all the way, the DJ told Us. So, at this point I ve agreed that as long as Hannah and Collin still talk to their siblings and the kids can interact with each other, then that s fine with me. I ll go along. And I don t have no direct contact as of right now. Jon and Kate tied the knot in 1999 and welcomed Madelyn and Cara in 2001. The sextuplets were born in 2004 and the family began filming Jon and Kate Plus 8 three years later. Jon left the show in 2009 amid his divorce from Kate, 44. He now says that the hit TLC series has become a cautionary tale for fans. It s weird because our show became almost political, a big controversy, the part-time prep cook said. Then I was like, This isn t for me and I wanted to leave. Then I saw a decline in some of my children and I decided this wasn t for my children and I wanted to take some of them off the show . And then for future shows, she was like yes and I was saying no, and then it became this legal battle because we re trying to decide what s right and what s wrong. Any time there is turmoil, that becomes a media circus. So, here we are. Biggest Feuds in Reality TV History The former reality TV star has been vocal about his children s desires to stop filming in the past but told Us that he plans to be more reserved when speaking about his kids in the future. My twins have asked me not to speak about them to the media and I ve stopped, he said. Their birthday came up and I didn t say anything. And the two that live with me Colin and Hannah I decided that I m not going to talk about them anymore because now I know they re safe, they re OK. And so, I ve decided to just let all the kids be teenagers. Anything else that comes up will just be about me and her, whatever that might be.

All officers survived the Wednesday violence and the suspected shooter, Maurice Hill, is in custody on charges including attempted murder. But Anthony Voci, the district attorney s homicide chief, warned Monday that the the scale of this investigation is immeasurable and will take months to complete. Over 100 rounds of ammunition were fired, Voci said, and investigators are now digging bullets out of cars, ceilings and walls. Investigators are also working to process footage from over 250 body-worn cameras as well as footage from home surveillance cameras, Voci said. That is why it would be premature to talk about any and all the details as it relates to these charges because it s our anticipation that there will be more based on what we see on the film and what we find throughout the investigation, Voci said at a news conference on Monday. Officers were serving a narcotics warrant on Hill and had entered a North Philadelphia home when gunfire erupted Wednesday afternoon, authorities said. Hill allegedly barricaded himself inside and fired from the first floor as he held two officers and three civilians hostage on the second floor, police said. Gunfire rained down on police for hours. Gunshots ricocheted off sidewalks and homes as officers crawled and crouched behind cars to avoid getting hit. After a tense, seven-hour standoff during which Hill and his lawyer spoke over the phone with the district attorney and police commissioner tear gas was deployed and Hill surrendered. Hill, who has an extensive criminal record, has been charged with attempted murder, aggravated assault, assault of a law enforcement officer, simple assault, unlawful restraint, reckless endangerment, violations of the uniforms firearms act, causing or risking a catastrophe and possession of an instrument of crime, Philadelphia District Attorney Larry Krasner said at Monday s news conference. Hill s attorney, Shaka Johnson, told ABC News last week that he believed the standoff wasn t planned. He said Hill, who welcomed a baby two days earlier, was caught up in the moment and the situation escalated quickly. According to Johnson, Hill wasn t making demands to police and just wanted to end the situation in a way that ensured him no harm. Hill will appear in court on Sept. 5, Krasner said. Johnson could not immediately be reached for comment on Monday. Four others, whom Krasner did not name, were arrested in the case on charges including drug and paraphernalia possession and conspiracy, Krasner said Monday. They will appear in court on Sept. 3, Krasner said. Copyright 2019, ABC Radio.

Raja Krishnamoorthi, a Schaumburg Democrat, questions Anne Schuchat, principal deputy secretary for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as she appears before a subcommittee hearing on lung disease and e-cigarettes in September on Capitol Hill. Associated Press Proposed legislation backed by two Illinois Democrats in Congress calls for establishing a user fee on e-cigarette manufacturers and importers and using the money to combat teen vaping. Sen. Dick Durbin of Springfield, Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Schaumburg and Republican Rep. Peter King of New York introduced the proposal Friday in Chicago. The trio previously created a bipartisan Congressional Caucus to End the Youth Vaping Epidemic, and Krishnamoorthi has called for a ban on flavored e-cigarettes. The new PREVENT Act, for Providing Resources to End the Vaping Epidemic Now for Teenagers, would create a quarterly user fee on manufacturers and importers of e-cigarettes, similar to the fee assessed on traditional cigarettes. The legislation would direct 2 million of the revenue to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration to develop a prevention program aimed at decreasing the use of e-cigarettes on school grounds. Starting in the 1970s and continuing to today, education and prevention programs proved essential in decreasing youth cigarette use, Krishnamoorthi said. However, today we are faced with a new public health epidemic youth vaping. E-cigarette use rose by 218 among middle schoolers and by 135 among high school students between 2017 and 2019, according to the National Youth Tobacco Survey. More than 5 million youth use e-cigarettes, which has been declared an epidemic by the surgeon general, FDA, CDC and Department of Health and Human Services. Durbin said the bill builds on previous tobacco prevention strategies helping fund preventive efforts that steer kids away from vaping and helping those already struggling with nicotine addiction. If we don't take this seriously, we risk the health of an entire generation of American kids, he said. The FDA now collects annual and quarterly user fees from manufacturers and importers of cigarettes, snuff, chewing tobacco, roll-your-own tobacco, cigar and pipe tobacco. Those fees will generate 712 million in fiscal 2020. The PREVENT Act would require training school employees to identify and prevent youth vaping and provide resources to parents and school personnel. It calls for social media and marketing campaigns about the health risks of e-cigarette use by students. The bill also calls for Resources for students on how to communicate with their peers on the dangers of e-cigarette use. Partnering with school counselors to assist with cessation tools. Resources to help treat youth nicotine addiction. State and local health agencies and nonprofits could apply for CDC grants for prevention programs at middle and high schools. The legislation is endorsed by a number of anti-tobacco, anti-drug and health care advocacy groups and medical professional organizations.", "title": "Krishnamoorthi, Durbin propose fee on e-cigarette makers, importers", "dataset": "sample", "labels": "['not_related_to_city']", "annot_city": "[]"}, {"id": 599, "city": "orlando", "url": "http://www.watermarkonline.com/2019/09/19/watermarks-wedding-bells-carlos-guillermo-smith-and-jerick-mediavilla/", "text": " When we met and we first started flirting, in my mind I couldn t accept that someone so sweet, so kind, and so handsome would actually take an interest in me that had NOTHING to do with politics, says Florida Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith. Carlos met Jerick Mediavilla at The Venue in Orlando during an event supporting the Latinx community impacted by the Pulse shooting in 2016. Carlos was attending to support Proyecto Somos Orlando as an elected official. Jerick had been encouraged to attend by a friend as a way to meet new people. Jerick moved to the U.S. in November 2016. I didn t know anyone at the event, only my friend Rafael and that s it. I was sitting by myself in a corner next to the restrooms, when my attention got caught in the energy that is Carlos Guillermo Smith, explained Jerick. It was exactly two years after they met at The Venue that they said I do in the very same location on Aug. 4. My favorite moment was to hold Carlos hand throughout the event. We were always holding hands, says Jerick. I also loved the amount of people that attended the event which was close to 200 and of course, the finale of the event, when Natalia Taylor Adonis performed All Dressed in Love by Jennifer Hudson. As outspoken defenders of the LGBTQ community, it was important for the couple to highlight the community. From the location to the photographer, nearly all of the vendors for their Orlando wedding were LGBTQ-owned businesses. Carlos and Jerick walked down the aisle to an enchanting performance of Cindy Lauper s True Colors by the Orlando Gay Chorus. The commitment to highlight the LGBTQ community came as no surprise, especially as thousands of people watched the couple s engagement at Come Out With Pride. In a very public display of love and commitment Jerick popped the question while on stage at the event. Overwhelmed with excitement, Carlos responded with a resounding F k yes. Continuing their wedding celebrations, Carlos and Jerick had a second, more intimate wedding in Puerto Rico on Sept. 1. In Puerto Rico, I loved seeing our two worlds come together, Jerick says. Family from Mexico, Montreal, Vancouver, Puerto Rico and different cities in the U.S. came together for our union. That was unforgettable to me. Equality Florida executive director and friend, Nadine Smith officiated the wedding in the beautiful Hotel El Convento. The couple walked down the aisle to Hans Zimmer s Maestro from the movie The Holiday and danced their first dance to a hit from the Material Girl herself. Our first dance as a married couple was to the 80 s hit Crazy For You by none other than Madonna. That is OUR song, says Carlos. As the happy couple looks to the future, it is clear they are ready to live their happily ever after. I see myself beside my husband, supporting him on his professional endeavors, says Jerick. I feel that life has prepared me to be the partner, friend and support system he needs. I see him looking at me the same way every day, every time.

After the heartbreaking M s Pub fire to ring in the 2016 new year, Samuelson could have retired, having earned impressive accolades throughout a storied career President of the Omaha Restaurant Association, more than 20 years of delightful Italian at the Old Market s Vivace, inductee of the Omaha Hospitality Hall of Fame, with thirty-plus years at everyone s favorite downtown eatery, M s Pub. Instead, this patriarch has combined his experience with that of his young and passionate nephews, Aaron and Justin Halbert, to bring us three restaurant concepts in just three years under the umbrella company of SamFam. That number is notable on its own, but is especially startling when you consider that nearly 20 percent of restaurant ventures close within their first year. With the Reader entering its banner 25th year of publication as Omaha s alternative news source, we re focusing on the things that make our little slice of heaven special. So, let s take a look at the SamFam portfolio, and keep an eye on this family company s bright future. Advertisement Herbe Sainte When thinking of America s great food cities, New Orleans sits at the top or near the top of almost everyone s list. So it s only natural that channeling the Cajun Capital has led to success for SamFam. Its Aksarben-area establishment was intended to operate primarily as a watering hole featuring famous Southern cocktails like the Sazerac and Hurricane. In fact, a liqueur that is a Sazerac ingredient, Herbsaint, is the namesake of the concept. Herbe Sainte also features Louisiana brewery Abita with five offerings from that New Orleans-area purveyor. Advertisement But Omahans were not only thirsty, but hungry for a slice of the South, and SamFam quickly pivoted to increase dining options, adding lunch service, a popular brunch menu oh, hey beignet. , and a shrimp and oyster bar. The end result is a tasty trip to the Crescent City, with on-theme craft cocktails and regional delights like peel-and-eat shrimp within a sleek yet cozy-chic space. The best way to sum up this bar and restaurant. With a famous Creole phrase, of course Laissez les bon temps rouler, which roughly translates to let the good times roll. Della Costa When Midtown Crossing staple Brix closed in controversy, many wondered what could fill one of the anchor spaces of that development after such an abrupt departure. Enter the second SamFam effort, the Coastal Mediterranean cuisine of Della Costa that debuted in May 2017. Meaning of the coast, this eatery infuses the sea into every facet. Take the hearty Cacciucco, a rustic seafood stew, or a grilled swordfish wrap. The linguine di Mare features mussels, scallops, and shrimp. Della Costa truly delivers on its premise with each dish. However, an expansive, recently re-focused menu offers plenty of dishes from the land for those who don t love seafood. This offering was not without complications, including an oversized rental bay. That often left the restaurant feeling cold and cavernous, against the warm Mediterranean brand the family had worked so hard to achieve. Fortunately, the SamFam team was receptive to pivoting once again. In May 2018, a year after the opening of Della Costa, Cafe Costa was born. This caf and bakery occupy the Farnam side of the original space and offer freshly baked goods like croissants and scones with inventive flavor pairings. Cafe Costa also sells homemade sorbet and ice cream that changes daily, as well as a cost-conscious 8 soup and sandwich lunch combo. The coffee is provided by local roaster Hill of Beans, which also operates the Roast coffee house in Aksarben Village and provides the coffee for west Omaha s Karma Koffee, among others. Consequently, Della Costa Cafe Costa have got you covered for breakfast, lunch, dinner, happy hour, and dessert. Mode de Vie Debuting in August 2018 was SamFam s latest concept, the aptly named Mode de Vie inside Regency Mall. Mode de Vie translates to way of life from French. Calling a champagne bar a way of life is fine by me, a longtime lover of all things bubbly. This new-ish eatery channels Aaron Halbert s certified sommelier experience into a well-rounded wine list with a focus on effervescence plus classic champagne cocktails. The only issue with this hip and delightful spot is its inclusion of cuisines from areas formerly occupied by France. In a sense, it seems to be glorifying colonialism. Perhaps the elevation of these sometimes-ignored areas of the world elevates them in culinary status, but I would be remiss not to be honest about my thoughts while being careful not to speak for a culture that isn t mine. Regardless, Mode de Vie offers eclectic and delicious dishes in each menu category. Appetizers like the cheese plate, a warm Vichyssoise, and a divine French onion sammie, can be easily complimented by all manner of desserts and dazzling drinks. The chain-heavy Regency Mall needed this infusion of locally owned soul, and SamFam certainly delivered. What s next for SamFam. Call us a bit mushy as we reflect during our anniversary year, but it s heartwarming to see a family business that enriches Omaha s culinary scene and strives to move it forward. We can t wait to see what this team comes up with next, and we congratulate it on successfully expanding our palate horizons in new and exciting ways.", "title": "Wham-Bam!
