National retailers — from Shake Shack, Applebee’s, and cap seller Lids — say their Big Apple stores are bouncing back more slowly than even neighboring states like New Jersey and Pennsylvania, which were also hard hit by the coronavirus.

The problem, sources say, is Manhattan, which used to be teeming with tourists and commuters — who have largely stayed away since the coronavirus pandemic hit in March. Wealthy Manhattanites also have more resources and flexibility to escape, indefinitely, to greener pastures, like the Hamptons, experts say.

The city’s ghost-town vibe has Shake Shack, which runs 162 restaurants in 20 states, reporting that its Big Apple stores will “take a longer period of time to fully recover than other parts of the country.”

The burger chain made the statement on July 7 as it reported that NYC same-store sales for the week of July 1 had fallen 58 percent compared to a year earlier — the steepest decline among all its regions. Sales in the chain’s Northeast and Southeast stores, by contrast, fell just 24 percent and 32 percent, respectively.

While Shake Shack didn’t mention Manhattan specifically, Zane Tankel, who owns 35 Applebee’s in the New York metro area, told The Post he’s reopened 18 restaurants in neighboring regions, including Brooklyn and Queens. But he sees no point in reopening his two Manhattan stores — not even for curbside pickup.

“I drive around the city all the time and it was an easy determination to see that there’s not enough traffic to open those restaurants,” said Tankel, CEO of Apple Metro. Prior to the pandemic, the Manhattan Applebee’s, located at 205 W. 50th St. and at 234 W. 42nd St., were his most productive locations — representing $25 million in revenues.

Macy’s, whose Manhattan flagship occupies over 1 million square feet of retail space, is also concerned. Asked how its NYC stores, which reopened on June 22, are performing compared to the rest of the country, a spokeswoman said it’s too soon to tell while also noting that “continued work-from-home trends mean fewer commuters coming into the city,” and that international and domestic tourism “remains low.”

Starbucks also appears affected, said Mark Kalinowski, restaurant analyst and founder of Kalinowski Equity Research, who pointed to the Seattle coffee seller’s June statement that just 5 percent of its company-operated US stores remained completely closed, even for takeout.

The bulk of the closed stores, Starbucks said, “are primarily located in the New York City metro area.”

“It’s not normal to see Central Park and Times Square empty,” Kalinowski explained.

Lawrence Berger, chairman of sports cap company Lids, said he’s been floored by the drop in business at the chain’s two best-performing New York stores — 1501 Broadway and 2 Times Square — since they reopened on June 22.

Foot traffic at those stores has been down 85 percent from a year ago — compared with a 20 percent average decline at Lids’ 900 other stores that have reopened across the country, said Berger, a partner of Ames Watson, which bought the 1,200-store chain last year.

Customer traffic at Lids stores in neighboring New Jersey and Pennsylvania, meanwhile, has actually increased 30 percent from a year ago, Berger added. And they all reopened at the same time.

“We expected New York City to be like the rest of the country when we reopened our stores here, but it’s a complete outlier,” Berger said. “There is no way to make money. It’s not an economically viable situation.”",

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/21/opinion/new-york-vote.html,New York,"Opinion | New Yorkers, Voting Could Get Much Easier for You","New York’s Legislature is meeting virtually, for the most part, this week, tackling unfinished business amid the coronavirus pandemic that has wreaked havoc on the state’s health and its finances.

Given what New York and other hard-hit states are up against, the Legislature has its work cut out for it. At least one form of relief state lawmakers can deliver in this brief and unusual summer session is swiftly passing a package of reforms to make it easier for New Yorkers to vote — a no-brainer ahead of an important presidential election.

Voting in New York is still harder than it should be. Across the state, election boards are too often packed with partisan patronage appointees rather than independent professionals. Voters often have faced lengthy lines or broken machines at poll sites. In 2014 and 2015, New York City improperly purged roughly 200,000 voters from the rolls.

Practices that are straightforward in other states, like voting by absentee ballot, can be an ordeal in New York. In the state’s congressional primary elections last month, for example, thousands of absentee ballots failed to arrive in time for people to vote. In other cases, absentee ballots may have been invalidated because of postmarking delays by the U.S. Postal Service. At least two candidates and a small group of voters have sued Gov. Andrew Cuomo and the State Board of Elections over these irregularities.",
https://nypost.com/2020/07/21/ny-bill-would-rollback-covid-19-liability-protection-for-hospitals/,New York,"NY bill would rollback COVID-19 liability protection for hospitals, nursing homes","ALBANY — Democratic state lawmakers are considering legislation this week that would partially rollback generous lawsuit liability protections for hospitals and nursing homes related to the coronavirus crisis, The Post has learned.

Legislative leaders in the state Senate and Assembly introduced a bill late Monday night that if passed, would remove immunity protections for healthcare facilities and personnel treating patients that haven’t been diagnosed with COVID-19.

Protections would remain however when treating patients diagnosed with and being treated for the virus.

The Legislature originally voted on and passed the measure within the state’s omnibus $177 billion state budget in April.

Drawing heavy support from the hospital and nursing home industry, the “Emergency or Disaster Treatment Protection Act” granted immunity protections for all healthcare facilities and medical professionals that treated, or arranged for treatment of COVID-19 patients, and any other individual who sought health care services during the COVID-19 emergency declaration.

However, the provision came under the microscope in the light of the state’s massive death toll in nursing homes related to the virus — which have now skyrocketed to upwards of 6,300 lives lost per state records.

Family members that have loved ones who died in facilities cannot sue unless they can prove a high standard of gross negligence occurred.

Bill sponsor Assemblyman Ron Kim (D-Queens) — a nursing home advocate — told The Post the legislation in its current form does not go far enough, and is pushing for a full, retroactive repeal of immunity protections going back to the pandemic’s start.

“I think it’s a good first step in admitting the original protections passed were wrong, but if it doesn’t go retroactively then it doesn’t provide justice for the people that are in the most pain right now,” he said.

“We need to figure out how to provide retroactive justice.”

“There has to be some sort of victim compensation fund for the people who lost their loved ones,” he added.

But the Greater New York Hospital Association — the powerful hospital lobbying arm directly involved in April’s negotiations with Gov. Andrew Cuomo over the protections – issued a memo of opposition, arguing the pandemic is far from over and the healthcare system is still facing challenges.

“The bill would prospectively remove protections for non-COVID-19 patients whose care would be affected by the response to another COVID-19 surge. This includes hospitals’ response to State orders by discharging patients early to prepare for a surge; deploying volunteers, staff, and medical students to alleviate severe staff shortages; expedited triage of emergency room patients to make room for an influx of COVID-19 patients; and the conversion of existing and creation of new hospital spaces to care for patients,” GNYHA spokesman Brian Conway said. He added that any retroactive provision would “make an already bad bill much worse.”

“Health care workers should not have to look over their shoulder for trying to save as many lives as possible during a horrific pandemic.”

“The pandemic isn’t over. The intent of passing these protections was to allow hospitals, nursing homes and doctors to do their job,” argued Tom Stebbins executive director of the Lawsuit Reform Alliance of New York.

“The flip that we’ve made on our healthcare workers is alarming. This is not over, every expert would say this is not over.”

State Senate sponsor Luis Sepulveda (D-The Bronx) told The Post Senate Democrats are still discussing the legislation, and would not comment further.

Lawmakers are expected to be in Albany through the end of the week — both physically and remotely — to pass a series of legislation backed up by the COVID-19 emergency.

Gov. Andrew Cuomo could not be reached for immediate comment.",
https://www.marketwatch.com/story/new-york-city-will-spend-100-million-a-year-on-health-care-expansion-covers-illegal-immigrants-2019-01-09,New York,New York City will cover illegal immigrants as part of $100 million-a-year health-care expansion,"NEW YORK (AP) — New York City will spend up to $100 million per year to expand health care coverage to people without health insurance, including immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Tuesday.

The plan involves expanding the city’s existing public insurance program and providing uninsured people with access to affordable care at city-owned facilities.

“From this moment on in New York City everyone is guaranteed the right to health care,” the Democratic mayor said. “We are saying the word guarantee because we can make it happen.”

The program is intended to reach an estimated 600,000 city residents currently without health insurance.

Half of that group can’t get health insurance because of their immigration status, de Blasio said, while the remainder includes young people who don’t think they need coverage and people who find the Affordable Care Act exchanges unaffordable or difficult to navigate.

The plan will build on the city’s existing public-option health insurance program called MetroPlus, which currently insures more than 500,000 low-income New Yorkers.

It will also aim to provide the uninsured with a range of services, including primary-care physicians, mental health services and prescription drugs, through the network of hospitals and clinics run by the city Health and Hospitals Corporation.

The city’s public hospitals already care for low-income New Yorkers, including those without legal immigration status, but too much of that care consists of expensive and inefficient emergency room visits, de Blasio said.

“We want to flip the script,” de Blasio said. “The emergency room truly should be the last resort.”

Dr. Mitchell Katz, the CEO of the public hospital system, said the city will hire additional primary-care doctors to meet an expected growth in demand.

The city’s plan is similar to programs that have been established elsewhere like the Healthy San Francisco initiative but is broader, said Katz, who has previously led health agencies in San Francisco and Los Angeles.

“Here psychotherapy is a covered benefit, which was not the case in San Francisco,” he said.

De Blasio said the program will take two years to implement and will be “the most comprehensive health care system in the nation.” Patients will be charged on a sliding scale, with the poorest New Yorkers paying nothing.

The mayor unveiled the program at a news conference at Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx after first announcing in on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe.”

“We’re going to make sure it’s seamless because that way people actually are encouraged to get the health care they need and never get to the point where they end up in the emergency room,” he said on “Morning Joe.”

He told the news conference that he would love to see a single-payer health care system enacted by Congress or by New York state lawmakers, but “our people need health care right now.”

De Blasio’s announcement came the day after Gavin Newsom, the newly inaugurated Democratic governor of California, proposed state-funded health care coverage for 138,000 young people living in the country illegally and reinstating a mandate for everyone to buy insurance or pay a fine.

Meanwhile on Tuesday, Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee of Washington state proposed a statewide public health insurance option available to anyone who is not covered by an employer.

The prospects for a statewide universal health care proposal in New York improved last fall when Democrats took control of the entire Legislature by winning a Senate majority. But while many liberal members of the Senate and Assembly say they favor an expansion of state-run health care, finding the money to pay for such a program would be challenging. The 2019 legislative season kicks off Wednesday.

Republican state Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, who ran unsuccessfully against de Blasio in the 2017 mayor’s race, criticized the expanded health care plan.

“Our citizens have a hard enough time covering their own healthcare costs and now Mayor de Blasio also wants them to pay for the healthcare of 300,000 citizens of other countries,” Malliotakis said in a statement. “The mayor must stop abusing the middle class and treating us like his personal ATM.”",

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced legislation today guaranteeing two weeks of paid time off for all workers.

If de Blasio's proposal is approved by the City Council, New York City would become the first and only American city to require paid vacation.

The proposal is expected to impact at least 500,000 people, according to the mayor's office, but would exempt businesses with fewer than five employees.

""To be the fairest big city in America, New Yorkers can't be forced to choose between bringing home a paycheck and taking time off to just disconnect or spend time with loved ones - that choice ends with Paid Personal Time,"" de Blasio said.

Among those the mayor’s office said the policy would benefit are 180,000 workers in professional services, 90,000 workers in the retail sector, and 200,000 in the hotel and food service industries.

“Every other major nation recognizes the necessity of Paid Personal Time,” de Blasio said. “We as a country must get there, and New York City will lead the way.”

Some critics called the mayor’s proposal costly for businesses.

“Workers in New York City already earn up to a week of paid time off. And while giving an additional two weeks paid vacation sounds like a nice idea, it has a significant cost for businesses, especially at a time when vacant storefronts plague our city streets and employment growth at city restaurants has gone flat, due in large part to other government mandates,"" Andrew Rigie, the executive director of the NYC Hospitality Alliance, said in a statement.

The Paid Personal Time proposal came one day after de Blasio announced a plan to provide health care for all city residents.

On Tuesday, de Blasio unveiled NYC Care, a program that will guarantee health care for the estimated 600,000 New Yorkers who do not currently have health insurance, including undocumented immigrants, according to the mayor's office.",
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/22/us/politics/supreme-court-guns-nyc-license.html,New York,Supreme Court Will Review New York City Gun Law,"“This is just the first case but not likely the last case where at least four justices open the way to a major ruling that could limit gun safety laws,” said Michael Waldman, the author of “The Second Amendment: A Biography,” referring to a Supreme Court rule requiring four votes to add cases to its docket.

The New York City ordinance challenged in the new case allows residents with so-called premises licenses to take their guns to one of seven shooting ranges within the city limits. But the ordinance forbids them to take their guns anywhere else, including second homes and shooting ranges outside the city, even when they are unloaded and locked in a container separate from ammunition.

The Supreme Court’s new majority seems ready to continue a project begun in 2008, when the court, by a 5-to-4 vote, established an individual right to keep guns in the home for self-defense. That decision, District of Columbia v. Heller, was both revolutionary and in its way quite limited. Exactly what the Second Amendment protects has been in dispute ever since.

Justice Antonin Scalia’s majority opinion in the Heller decision included an important limiting passage that was almost certainly the price of Justice Kennedy’s fifth vote. “Nothing in our opinion,” Justice Scalia wrote, “should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, or laws forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools and government buildings, or laws imposing conditions and qualifications on the commercial sale of arms.”

Since the Heller decision, lower courts have overwhelmingly upheld state and local gun control laws. The Supreme Court, in turn, has refused to hear appeals from those decisions. Justice Kavanaugh’s arrival changed that.",

The Chrysler Building, an Art Deco masterpiece that has been a defining image of New York City's skyline for decades, has been put up for sale, a minority owner of the building and a broker hired to market the property said on Wednesday.

The 77-story stainless steel-clad skyscraper, briefly the world's tallest building after it was finished in 1930, is 90 percent owned by the Abu Dhabi Investment Council, a sovereign wealth fund, with developer Tishman Speyer owning the remainder.

""It's exciting. I'm getting inquiries from all over the world,"" said Darcy Stacom, chairman and head of New York City Capital Markets at brokerage CBRE Group Inc.

The 1.26 million square foot building underwent a $100 million renovation after Tishman acquired the property in 1997. Tishman later reduced its holding. The sovereign wealth fund paid $800 million when it bought its stake in 2008.

The building's brand and its location on 42nd Street just east of Grand Central Terminal, a major Manhattan transportation hub, are ripe for greater retail exploitation, Stacom said.

The building's occupancy rate is in the low 80 percent range, below the city average, according to CBRE. Stacom declined to reveal the asking price for the building.

Stacom declined to give the vacancy rate at the Chrysler Building or the asking price.

Buildings on average are 50 years old in Midtown and many store-fronts are empty, hard hit by e-commerce. With the new Hudson Yards district on the far West Side attracting major corporations, concerns have been raised about Midtown's appeal.

But Midtown remains a favored business destination. JPMorgan Chase & Co plans to build a new headquarters on nearby Park Avenue. One Vanderbilt, a marquee office tower, is rising just west of Grand Central.

Age could be a selling point, too, as seen by the popularity of Midtown South, which has the city's lowest vacancy rate and companies such as Alphabet Inc's Google and Facebook Inc occupy century-old structures.

The decision to sell a property is driven by numerous factors, not often due to unsatisfactory performance, said Patrice Derrington, director of the real estate development program at Columbia University.

""New York City constantly offers an appropriately varied array of formats for office tenants, creating a complementary ecosystem,"" she said.",

Packing peanuts are out, too, as ""manufactures and stores may no longer sell or offer for sale loose foam packaging."" There are exceptions to the ban, though. Foam containers that are used for prepackaged food that are sealed up before a restaurant or store receives them are acceptable. The foam containers that store raw meat, pork, fish, seafood, or poultry sold from a butcher case are also considered an exception.

The foam blocks used to protect items during shipping are not included in the ban either. From now until June 30, a ""six month warning period"" is in effect for NYC businesses. Beginning July 1, though, ""establishments found in violation of the foam ban will receive fines for each Notice of Violation issued within a 12-month period."" One violation will run you $250. A second offense is $500, and for a third or more, the fine is $1,000.

The department notes there are several alternative packaging options. Instead of foam, businesses can look to aluminum, rigid plastics, uncoated paper, glass, and compostable items as substitutes.

ALBANY — New York State lawmakers have agreed to impose a statewide ban on most types of single-use plastic bags from retail sales, changing a way of life for millions of New Yorkers as legislators seek to curb an unsightly and omnipresent source of litter.

The plan, proposed a year ago by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, would be the second statewide ban, after California, which banned bags in 2016. Hawaii also effectively has a ban in place, since all the state’s counties bar such single-use bags.

New York’s ban, which would begin next March, would forbid stores to provide customers with single-use plastic bags, which are nonbiodegradable and have been blamed for everything from causing gruesome wildlife deaths to thwarting recycling efforts.

The ban, which is expected to be part of the state’s budget bills that are slated to be passed by Monday, would have a number of carveouts, including food takeout bags used by restaurants, bags used to wrap deli or meat counter products and bags for bulk items. Newspaper bags would also be exempted, as would garment bags and bags sold in bulk, such as trash or recycling bags.",

For months, the top-selling item at Fat Cat Kitchen was a cookie packed with chocolate chunks, dusted with salt flakes and infused with the stylish cannabis derivative cannabidiol, or CBD.

But as of last week, customers won’t find the cookie on the Manhattan restaurant and bakery’s menu.

On Friday, a health inspector sealed up the restaurant’s supply of CBD-infused baked goods in a plastic bag and told Fat Cat Kitchen to stop selling them as part of a citywide embargo on food products containing CBD.

The Department of Health and Mental Hygiene confirmed on Tuesday that it was ordering restaurants under its jurisdiction not to sell food products containing CBD.

In a statement, the health department said that New York City eateries were not “permitted to add anything to food or drink that is not approved as safe to eat.” That included CBD, which had not been “deemed safe as a food additive,” the department said. The crackdown was first reported by Eater.",
https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/06/new-york-orders-restaurants-to-stop-serving-weed-related-cbd.html,New York,"New York City orders restaurants to stop serving weed-related CBD, threatening a booming industry","New York City's health department has ordered restaurants to stop adding CBD to food and drinks, threatening to thwart the budding trend.

Bars, cafes and restaurants across the city have been increasingly adding CBD, short for cannabidiol, to cocktails, coffee and food. The compound, which comes from the cannabis plant, promises to deliver the calming benefits of marijuana without the high that comes from THC.

New York City's health department started cracking down on restaurants in the city last month, saying CBD wasn't approved as a safe product for consumers. It's now prohibiting businesses from adding the supplement to food or drink.

""The Health Department takes seriously its responsibility to protect New Yorkers' health,"" a spokeswoman said in an email to CNBC. ""Until cannabidiol (CBD) is deemed safe as a food additive, the Department is ordering restaurants not to offer products containing CBD.""

Most CBD was legalized in December when President Donald Trump signed the farm bill. Industry insiders and analysts expected this to fuel an already growing market. However, the Food and Drug Administration's ban on adding CBD to foods and drinks was seen as a possible hurdle.

The FDA prohibits companies from adding active ingredients that are drug products in foods and drinks. CBD falls into this category because it's the main ingredient in Epidiolex, a drug the FDA approved last year to treat severe childhood epilepsy.

When Trump signed the farm bill, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb released a statement saying the agency would continue enforcing a ban on adding CBD to food and drinks while it looked into creating a pathway for such products to legally enter the market.

The New York City health department started embargoing CBD products in January. An embargo means officials ask restaurants not to use the products, but they don't remove them or ask restaurants to throw out or destroy CBD. So far, the city has ordered eight restaurants to stop using CBD.

Eric Cahan said he has already started pulling CBD-based food and drinks from his Manhattan cafe. Cahan co-owns Mamacha, which specializes in CBD matcha tea. He said the store has already pulled CBD cookies, chocolates and bottled tea and seltzer from shelves.

Cahan said he has also instructed his baristas to stop mixing CBD drinks. Customers normally can pay $4 to add 15 milligrams of CBD to their beverages. Now, Cahan said Mamacha is selling drinks and CBD oil separately. It's offering a two-day dose kit for $12 that people can use to mix into their drinks.

""It's weird, because it feels like the health department is against small businesses,"" he said. ""Don't they want us to do well and continue? Why would they not want us to? It feels arbitrary and ridiculous.""",

We're trying to fill the gap to let people know, based on the latest science, what the safe levels of contaminants in water are.""

New York City's water system, which served 8,958,659 people between 2012 and 2017, has 8 contaminants across its water supply, according to the environmental group's findings.

An independent study recently found New York City's water to be the cleanest in state and Erin Silk, a spokesperson from the New York Department of Health, disputed the validity of EWG's more conservative recommendations.

""Unlike maximum contaminant levels, EWG's guidelines are not enforceable standards protective of public health as established through a scientific process that evaluates the health impacts of the contaminant and the technology and cost required for prevention, monitoring, and/or treatment,"" said Silk, adding, ""New York State agencies are also undertaking what is arguably the nation's most comprehensive investigation of potential sources of contamination by these chemicals.""

The following contaminants were detected above the environmental group's own recommended health guidelines in New York City:

Maximum contaminant levels have been set by the Environmental Protection Agency since the Safe Water Drinking Act passed through Congress in 1974. EWA and EPA's recommendations diverge both on the recommended level of contaminants and the number of contaminants for which state agencies should be held accountable.

The EPA did not respond to numerous requests by Patch seeking comment on the findings of the study, which argues its regulatory system is ""broken.""

""The inexcusable failure of the federal government's responsibility to protect public health means there are no legal limits for more than 160 unregulated contaminants in U.S. tap water,"" Environmental Working Group researchers stated in its ""State of American Drinking Water.""

A focal point of the organization's concern is that Environmental Protection Agency has not added a new contaminant to its list of toxic chemicals list covered by the Safe Drinking Water Act in almost 20 years.

In the case of polyfluorinated substances, or PFAs, the environmental group estimated up to 110 million Americans could have the potentially cancer-causing, immune-system damaging contaminant in their drinking water. Yet the EPA requires drinking water utilities across the country to test for only six of 14 known substances in the category.



Independent experts share the group's concerns.

""With the science on what we call 'emerging contaminants' continuing to grow, it is clear that there are components of our tap water that can be improved,"" Kristin Strock, professor of Environmental Science at Dickinson College, told Patch.

Strock, who is not affiliated with the environmental group, also emphasized the challenges in the process of federally regulating harmful contaminants, suggesting the current system is somewhat backward.

""The road to regulating harmful contaminants is difficult, as our current construct for ensuring clean water is based on 'proving' that something is harmful before it is regulated as opposed to assuming contaminants could be harmful and 'proving' them safe before allowing them to go into industrial production and, as a result, our environment,"" she said. ""The EPA has been working on identifying safe limits for a number of these emerging contaminants and continues to work on the problem.""

EWA recommends New Yorkers concerned about water contaminants invest in filtering technologies, such as carbon filters, that reduce many, but not all, contaminants.

But Olga Naidenko, vice president of science investigation at the group, argued the responsibility of purifying water should not fall on those who drink tap water, but rather those who contaminate it.

""Industries and companies that released PFAS into the environment and drinking water sources — should be responsible to covering such costs,"" Naidenko said. ""It is unfair for homeowners to be saddled with costs for pollution they did not create.""

Alberto Reyes fumed. He had paid $50 yesterday to have his air-conditioner checked at an electronics repair shop in Williamsburg to make sure it would be ready for the heat. He took it home and turned it on. Only hot air came out. Now he was back in the shop, his blue polo shirt stained a few shades darker by sweat.

“The fan is useless,” Mr. Reyes complained in Spanish, pacing inside the graffiti-tagged warehouse of a store, where old A.C. units were piled outside. On a day like Saturday, as New York City and much of the country struggled to ride out a heat wave, Mr. Reyes saw his patience melt. “One cannot breathe properly without an A.C.,” he said.

New York roasted on Saturday as the heat approached 100 degrees, and thanks to air thickened by humidity, it felt even hotter. For some, the heat brought only discomfort. Yet officials feared far more perilous consequences. Mayor Bill de Blasio declared a state of emergency lasting through the weekend, saying in a news conference on Friday, “We have not seen temperatures like this in at least seven years.”",

It was stunning.","I went on a tour of the Newtown Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant, the largest wastewater facility in New York City.

The plant treats wastewater from more than 1 million people. It only opens to the public a few times per year.

I left awestruck by the magnitude of the facility. Here’s what it’s like.

Visit Business Insider’s homepage for more.

On a crisp fall morning, I showered, brushed my teeth, and sent all that used water down the drain. Half an hour later, I was on the subway, following my wastewater to its next destination: the Newtown Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant in Greenpoint, Brooklyn.

The plant treats wastewater from more than 1 million people on the east side of Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn and Queens. It’s the largest of New York City’s 14 wastewater facilities, and features pairs of giant silver “digester eggs” that glisten in the sunlight.

The plant only opens to the public a few times per year – I visited as part of Open House New York, a weekend-long event that grants entry to closed-off sites throughout the city.

As someone who often writes about waste, water, and contamination, I expected to enjoy learning about the process of turning the “sludge” from New York homes into clean liquid. But I left even more awe-struck by the magnitude of the facility than I’d anticipated.

Take a look inside this palace for poop.

I arrived at the plant on a Saturday morning. Staffers came prepared with hard hats and yellow vests for us visitors.

The plant recently underwent a $5 billion renovation and expansion, so it looks shiny and new.

Foto: sourceAria Bendix/Business Insider

The Newtown Creek plant was originally built in 1967. Nearly three decades later, the city announced plans to expand the facility and make upgrades to comply with the US Clean Water Act, which requires at least 85% of pollutants to be removed from wastewater before it can be discharged into local waterways.

At the time, neighbors were opposed to the expansion because they had grown tired of the rotten egg smell (which no longer exists).

The designers opted for materials that make the building stand out — a notable difference from most wastewater-treatment plants.

“It’s hard to hide a 110-foot-tall building,” Richard Olcott, one of the plant’s designers, told the Ornamental Metal Institute of New York. “So, rather than hiding it, we thought we should do the opposite: We should really show the thing off and make something everyone would look at and go, ‘Wow! What’s that?'”

The fist thing you see when you walk through the gates is the plant’s massive pipe system, which controls for odors.

The plant usually accepts 250 million gallons of wastewater each day from toilets, sinks, and storm drains.

Foto: sourceAria Bendix/Business Insider

After wastewater travels through sewers to the treatment plant, it passes through screens that remove large chunks of garbage like bottles, rags, newspapers, and plastic cups. Pam Elardo, New York’s deputy commissioner of wastewater treatment, said one the most common forms of trash is baby or facial wipes that claim to be flushable but aren’t.

All that trash is then sent to a landfill.

From there, wastewater travels to sedimentation tanks, where heavier solids (like poop) sink to the bottom. Lighter particles, including grease and small bits of plastic, float to the top.

Foto: sourceAria Bendix/Business Insider

This separation makes the top particles easy to remove. The bottom ones – the “sludge” – are sent to a device that spins them rapidly. The centrifugal force helps sift out tiny particles like coffee grinds from the bulk of the waste.

The sludge then moves to large “bubbling tanks,” where it’s mixed with air. The process encourages oxygen-using bacteria to feed on pollutants in the water.

Foto: sourceAria Bendix/Business Insider

After about three to six hours, the mixture moves to “settling tanks,” where heavy particles are further sifted out. Some return to the “bubbling tanks” to help stimulate the growth of more good bacteria that feeds on pollutants.

Once the treated water is ready to be disinfected, it goes to tanks containing sodium hypochlorite, a chemical found in bleach, for about 15 to 20 minutes. Then the water is discharged into local waterways.

But some sludge remains even after this long treatment process. Those particles are thickened and sent to “digester eggs.”

Foto: sourceAria Bendix/Business Insider

The eggs are clad in stainless steel and light up at night. There are eight of them at the facility.

When the sludge arrives, it gets heated to around 95 degrees Fahrenheit in an oxygen-free environment, where it remains for 15 to 20 days. This creates more good bacteria that breaks down the sludge into water, carbon dioxide, and methane gas.

The egg shape helps conserve energy for churning waste.

Our tour group took an elevator to the top of these “digester eggs.”

The eggs are connected by a set of glass walkways 110 feet in the air.

Foto: sourceAria Bendix/Business Insider

The walkways are lined with sturdy guardrails. At each intersection, you can see some of the equipment used to control the “digestion” process.

Foto: sourceAria Bendix/Business Insider

Most of the tour was odor-free, but there was certainly an unpleasant stench near the digesters.

Foto: sourceAria Bendix/Business Insider

I understand why Greenpoint residents used to complain about the rotten-egg smell.

If you look closely, you can see what’s happening inside the digesters.

Foto: sourceAria Bendix/Business Insider

We didn’t get to see the sludge up close, but were told it’s black in color and has the consistency of pea soup.

Foto: sourceAria Bendix/Business Insider

After up to 20 days, the sludge is moved from the eggs to storage tanks.

Foto: sourceAria Bendix/Business Insider

Eventually, it gets transferred from a storage tank to a “sludge boat” that takes the waste to another plant in the Bronx. That plant removes liquid from the sludge, forming it into a “cake” that can be used as fertilizer.

Foto: sourceAria Bendix/Business Insider

By the end of the tour, the elevators had temporarily stopped working. (The staff had warned us earlier that the elevators were fickle.) So we exited down 11 flights of stairs.

Foto: sourceAria Bendix/Business Insider

Back on the ground, the guides explained that the facility is exploring more uses for its byproducts. For example, the plant is working on a pilot program to collect food waste, add it to the digester eggs, and produce methane gas that could power local homes.

But there are still some issues to sort out: Elardo said that although New York City’s water quality is the best it has been in 100 years, facilities like Newtown Creek still don’t filter for every known contaminant.

Foto: sourceAria Bendix/Business Insider

“We’re designed to take human waste and industrial waste and make it clean,” Elardo said. “There are a lot of exotic things that come our way that we shouldn’t necessarily be spending a lot of time, energy, and money treating.”

Turning the wastewater from sewage pipes into “100% H2O” could cost “hundreds of billions of dollars,” she added.

That means microplastics — tiny bits of plastic less than 5 millimeters long — can linger in the treated water that enters local waterways.

Foto: sourceAria Bendix/Business Insider

The best way to treat microplastics, Elardo said, would be to cut them off at the source – the way the city already does with silver from dental facilities.

“In the old days, we got tons of silver in our system that actually contaminated the biosolids. There was a huge national program to make dentists pull the silver out at their offices,” she said. “That’s the kind of source control I’m talking about – either treat it at the source or eliminate the product.”

By the end of my visit, I was struck by how the facility combines such a practical mission — cleaning people’s poop — with stunning design elements.

https://nypost.com/2019/11/27/nycs-fabled-tap-water-leaving-bad-taste-in-mouths-of-residents/,New York,NYC’s fabled tap water leaving bad taste in mouths of residents,"New York City residents say their so-called “Champagne of drinking water” is more bottom-of-the-barrel prosecco these days.

The Big Apple’s famously delicious tap H2O has been tasting and smelling like mildew and dirt for more than a week, some residents say.

“To me very moldy, but others have described a dirt taste,” said Courteney Corvalan, a Harlem resident who noticed the off-taste last week.

Amy Wilson, in the Upper West Side, tweeted Tuesday, about a “mildew taste” that’s been there for nearly a week.

Another New Yorker tweeted on Monday that her tap water “tastes funny.”

Complaints to 311 have spiked. The standard number of gripes about tap water per day is five, according to the city Department of Environmental Protection.

But in the week from Nov. 18 to Nov. 25, there were more than 150 grumbles to 311 about water quality, with folks describing the flavor or scent as musty, stale, chemical, bitter or metallic — and even “chlorine” or just “sewer,” public records show.

The number of complaints was 10 on Wednesday, according to the DEP.

The majority of gripes came from Manhattan or the Bronx, which, according to the DEP’s water distribution map, receive a mix of tap water from the Croton and Catskill-Delaware reservoir systems.

The Croton Reservoir system, which is more mineral-rich, may be to blame, the DEP said.

“Our water quality scientists believe the more recent taste concerns are related to seasonal changes in the watershed,” said DEP spokesman Edward Timbers.

“As the temperature drops in the Hudson Valley this can affect the natural mixing of water within the city’s Croton Watershed reservoirs,” Timber said. “Operational adjustments have been made to ensure that the best possible water is being delivered to the 8.6 million residents of the city.”

The DEP said the percentage of water coming from each supply system changes on a day-to-day and hour-to-hour basis, and it is tested more than 650,000 times a year to ensure it is safe. Typically, the Croton system reservoirs make up 10 percent of the city’s water supply.

The Catskill aqueduct was shut down six weeks ago for regular maintenance, the DEP said.

Complaints poured in last fall after the city started taking more water from the Croton reservoir system, as it prepared to close one of the two aqueducts in the Catskill-Delaware system for a repair project.",Subsistence - Physiology
https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/new-york-city-set-to-pass-ambitious-building-energy-efficiency-bill,New York,New York City Set to Pass Ambitious Energy Efficiency Mandate,"New York City is on the verge of enacting one of the most ambitious citywide building energy efficiency laws in the country, aimed at getting its biggest buildings — including landmarks like the Empire State Building and Trump Tower — to shave their carbon emissions footprint by 40 percent by 2030 or face financial penalties.

Backers of the bill say it’s an important step to help meet New York state’s broader climate change goals, and could pave the way for similar efforts in cities across the country.

But opponents, including New York City real estate firms, say the bill could place overly costly and potentially impossible energy-reduction demands on the city’s biggest buildings, while exempting too many older and less-efficient buildings to be effective.

The law is part of a broader package called the Climate Mobilization Act, which was passed by a City Council committee on Thursday. Mayor Bill de Blasio is expected to sign the legislation into law on Monday.

First in the country

The new energy efficiency requirements for buildings over 25,000 square feet are at the heart of this climate-reduction package, given these structures' outsize role in the city’s energy consumption. Buildings of this size make up less than 2 percent of the city’s real estate, but account for roughly half of its energy use, and thus the city’s share of carbon emissions.

That’s made them a target of previous city building energy and carbon emissions efforts. New York City has already instituted building standards, known as the Greener, Greater Buildings Plan, that include a series of efficiency and data-collection requirements for buildings of this size, including annual benchmarking of their electricity and water consumption, periodic energy audits and retro-commissioning, and a requirement to undergo lighting and sub-metering upgrades by 2025.

But the new law would be the first of any city in the country to set specific emissions limits on large buildings, coupled with financial penalties for failing to comply, imposed through the newly created Office of Building Energy Performance.

Property owners have complained that the bill’s exemptions — it excludes houses of worship, rent-regulated apartments and low-income housing, and other categories of buildings — will leave too much burden on the remaining building owners to cut energy usage.

But the bill’s backers say it’s an important first step toward tackling a massive challenge for any city or state seeking to reduce their carbon emissions from the built environment. Buildings make up about 40 percent of U.S. energy consumption, according to the Energy Information Administration.

Retrofits, carbon trading on the table

New York state is engaged in its own ""Green New Deal"" push to reduce fossil fuel consumption and attain a zero-carbon energy mix by 2040, which will help the city’s biggest buildings meet their goals by reducing the carbon intensity of the electricity they use.

In the meantime, however, while most buildings don’t have much control over the carbon profile of the electricity they consume beyond installing solar panels or other clean generation, making them more efficient with the energy they do use will be a critical piece of any broader carbon-reduction scheme.

""Buildings will have to do deep energy retrofits, buy green power or eventually look at carbon trading,” John Mandyck, CEO of the Urban Green Council, a backer of the legislation, told Crain’s New York Business. “We get that it's tough and that billions of dollars will need to be spent to reduce carbon emissions. But new technology and new business models will be invented to help buildings get there.""

Other bills that make up the Climate Mobilization Act package include a property-assessed clean energy financing program to help find renewable energy or building energy efficiency improvements.

It also includes a bill that would direct the city to study whether it could close 21 natural-gas-fired power plants within its borders and replace them with renewable energy and energy storage, and a bill to require certain buildings to cover their roofs in solar panels, small wind turbines or “green roof” gardens.",Subsistence - Physiology
https://www.vox.com/energy-and-environment/2019/6/20/18691058/new-york-green-new-deal-climate-change-cuomo,New York,New York just passed the most ambitious climate target in the country,"Update, July 22: Gov. Andrew Cuomo has signed the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act into law. Our explainer, first published June 20, follows:

New York is the fourth most populous state in the US and its third-largest economy. Now it is poised to adopt the country’s most ambitious climate targets, including 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2040 and economy-wide, net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.

On Tuesday night, the state Senate passed the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, and on Wednesday night, the state Assembly passed it. All it requires now is a signature from Gov. Andrew Cuomo.

This is a big deal.

In passing bold climate legislation, New York will follow in the footsteps of Maine, Oregon, Washington, Colorado, New Mexico, California, and New Jersey, all of which have passed substantive clean energy policies in the past year or so. (Hawaii has had its 100 percent renewables target in place since 2015.)

And New York accomplished this feat the exact same way all those other states did it: by electing overwhelming Democratic majorities.

For years, the state Assembly has been under the control of Democrats, but in the Senate, the Independent Democratic Conference (IDC), a small group of conservative Democrats, caucused with Republicans, effectively giving Republicans control. Cuomo accepted and even encouraged this state of affairs, as it gave him tremendous personal power and infuriated his Democratic critics.

So for four years in a row, a broad coalition pushed the Climate and Community Protection Act (CCPA) through the assembly only to have it die in the Senate.

However, in the 2018 elections, the IDC got crushed, Cuomo got scared to the left by a challenge from Cynthia Nixon, and Democrats finally got the dual majorities they needed, which they immediately put to use with measures on voting rights, abortion, and protections for renters.

Last year, Cuomo put forward his own climate bill, the Climate Leadership Act, which he referred to as a Green New Deal for New York, annoying pretty much everyone. That bill contained electricity carbon goals but no economy-wide carbon goals, and nothing at all on equity.

But activists kept pushing (recently, a broad group of scholars intervened to help them), and finally, late on Wednesday night, the very last day of the legislative session, the bill was passed. (Cuomo is expected to sign it this week.) Miracles are real!

So what’s in it?

The bill that passed — renamed, for reasons no one can quite explain, the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA) — is closer to the old CCPA than it is to the governor’s bill, but it has a few key changes and amendments, which we’ll get into below.

Altogether, the final product represents an enormous victory for New York’s climate advocacy community, especially in the face of Cuomo’s long record of ... unhelpfulness. Let’s have a look.

100 percent, economy-wide net-zero carbon emissions by 2050

Originally, the CCPA targeted zero carbon emissions, economy-wide, by 2050. After the compromise, the CLCPA now targets net zero by 2050. (With an interim target: 40 percent reductions from 1990 emissions by 2030.)

The difference between “zero” and “net zero” is that only 85 percent of the reductions must come from New York’s own energy and industrial emissions; the remaining 15 percent can come from carbon offsets (e.g., from forestry or agriculture).

Activists are not thrilled with this, but it was arguably a necessary concession. There’s a case to be made that the state simply doesn’t have the statutory authority necessary to get to zero — there will inevitably be some hard-to-reach emissions, outside state authority, that require offsetting. Offsets also create an income stream for good forestry and ag practices.

The bill contains a number of provisions meant to avoid some of the negative effects offsets have had in other programs.

Stationary electric sources — power plants — cannot avail themselves of offsets. They are often located in disadvantaged communities, and anyway, it is well understood how to eliminate their emissions.

Offsets are reserved for facilities or processes where the technology for full elimination of carbon is not yet commercially available (think, for example, cement mixing). For those facilities, there will be a review every four years to ensure that they are using the best available technology (BAT) for reducing emissions before purchasing offsets.

All offsets must come from within 25 miles of the purchaser, to ensure that the benefits stay within local communities. Offset projects must benefit the local environment and, where possible, reduce co-pollutants. Biofuels and waste-to-energy projects are prohibited.

Nevertheless, put aside that last 15 percent. Just getting to 85 percent carbon-free will be an enormous lift for an industrialized economy like New York’s. This is the most stringent economy-wide carbon target in the US, in one of the most challenging states. It’s a new benchmark.

The plan to reduce emissions will be made by a council

Rather than specifying the mechanisms by which emissions will be reduced, the legislature set up a process to create a scoping plan, led by a 22-member Climate Action Council. The council will be composed of the heads of various New York state agencies, along with members appointed by the governor, the Senate, and the Assembly. (This is somewhat similar to how California handed over the policy details to its Air Resources Board.)

The council will convene advisory panels on various specific subjects (transportation, land use and local government, industry, etc.) and consult them in developing the scoping plan. It will also convene a just-transition working group to research and advise on workforce training, job impacts, and related matters. And it will consult with the climate justice working group. (That working group is created elsewhere in the bill; it will contain representatives from disadvantaged communities and environmental justice groups, as well as representatives from trade-exposed industries.)

Part of the council’s challenge will be integrating and building on all of the state’s existing climate and clean energy programs. The Natural Resources Defense Council cites “the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) to cap and cut carbon pollution from power plants; the $1 billion NY-Sun program to scale up solar power; ChargeNY, EVolve NY, and the Drive Clean Rebate to expand electric vehicle (EV) infrastructure statewide and get more EVs on the road; the state’s initiative to deploy 3,000 megawatts of battery storage by 2030; and a successful Clean Energy Standard to expand renewable energy penetration.”

Stitching all that together will take some doing, and the mandate is wide open. The council could suggest a carbon pricing system (to supplement or enhance RGGI), a variety of regulations, or, like most states, a mix. There are a few parameters: Emission reductions must be real and verifiable; they must be distributed equitably; they must not increase emissions of “co-pollutants”; and they must minimize so-called “leakage,” whereby emitting facilities simply relocate outside the state.

Every four years, the council will issue a comprehensive report on state greenhouse gas emissions and progress, and adjust its plan as needed. (The state will also integrate a social cost of carbon into all agency decisions.)

100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2040

Those who understand deep decarbonization understand that the electricity sector is key to the process. It is both the easiest sector to decarbonize and a means through which to decarbonize the others. (Electrify everything!)

The electricity targets in the bill actually got strengthened in the final compromise. Whereas the CCPA targeted 50 percent renewables by 2030, the CLCPA targets 70 percent renewable electricity by 2030 and 100 percent carbon-free electricity by 2040. (The mechanism for this will be the state’s renewable portfolio standard, administered by the Public Service Commission.)

New York now joins California, Nevada, Hawaii, Washington, New Mexico, Washington, DC, and Puerto Rico in targeting 100 percent clean power.

Also, just for kicks, the bill targets 9,000 MW of offshore wind energy by 2035, 6,000 MW of solar energy by 2025, and a 23 percent increase in energy efficiency.

A third of the benefits go to frontline communities

Originally, the CCPA stipulated that 40 percent of all state investments in climate and clean energy go to “disadvantaged communities” — those most vulnerable to the effects of climate change or most threatened by the transition away from fossil fuels.

Now, after some backroom wrangling, the language has become slightly more opaque. Here’s the relevant section of the CLCPA (just to give you a flavor of what I’ve been squinting at all day):

State agencies, authorities and entities, in consultation with the environmental justice working group and the climate action council, shall, to the extent practicable, invest or direct available and relevant programmatic resources in a manner designed to achieve a goal for disadvantaged communities to receive forty percent of overall benefits of spending on clean energy and energy efficiency programs, projects or investments in the areas of housing, workforce development, pollution reduction, low income energy assistance, energy, transportation and economic development, provided however, that disadvantaged communities shall receive no less than thirty-five percent of the overall benefits of spending on clean energy and energy efficiency programs, projects or investments and provided further that this section shall not alter funds already contracted or committed as of the effective date of this section.

Isn’t legislation fun to read?

Anyway, “40 percent of the investments” has become “probably 40 percent, but no less than 35 percent, of the benefits of the investments.” That’s a bit fuzzier, which is aggravating to the environmental justice community. “Frontline communities need more than a vague commitment for benefits,” Annel Hernandez of the NYC Environmental Justice Alliance told me. “We need direct investments to catalyze our transition to the clean renewable energy economy.”

It’s not yet clear how “disadvantaged communities” will be defined for the purposes of the bill (the climate justice working group will develop criteria, drawing on data from community air-monitoring systems). And it’s not yet clear how “benefits of the investments” will be defined. That’s likely going to mean an annual push-pull battle between activists and state regulators.

Still, it’s worth taking a step back and noting what a huge commitment this is. In California and Oregon, 40 percent of the revenue from cap and trade is set aside for disadvantaged communities, but that’s a single pot of money. New York’s bill ensures that 40 percent (or, ahem, no less than 35 percent) of all state climate and clean energy spending — funds from RGGI, the state’s Clean Energy Fund, any future initiatives established by this program — goes to disadvantaged communities.

That’s potentially many billions of dollars, spread across a range of agencies and programs. It could be a huge engine for lifting up vulnerable communities across the state.

The bill got somewhat screwed on job quality provisions

The bill originally contained a number of provisions meant to ensure that the state creates high-quality jobs, including measures on prevailing wages, apprenticeship programs, preferences for women- and minority-owned businesses, and more.

All of it got stripped out, because elsewhere in the legislature, a different deal was being hammered out, which would have put in place wage and job standards across all state government programs, not just the clean energy ones.

Long story short, at the last minute, that deal fell apart. All that’s left in the CLCPA? “The Act shall be subject to current prevailing wage law.”

That’s kind of thin gruel, especially for the unions that showed up to support the bill: Service Employees International Union 32BJ, New York State Nurses (NYSNA), the Teamsters, and others.

But the broad coalition that has come together over the years behind this bill — NY Renews now boasts more than 180 members, from unions to community groups to state and national environmental groups — is not finished. It plans to continue pushing for job quality measures. And it’s also thinking longer term, about further measures, including something like a tax-and-invest system (like Oregon’s). The struggle will continue.

Why this is a very big deal

Advocates didn’t get everything they wanted, but in the big picture, the CLCPA is a huge, huge win. The country’s third-biggest economy has passed its most ambitious economy-wide climate targets — some of the most ambitious climate targets in the world. And hitting those targets will generate ongoing waves of investment into the state’s worst-off communities.

It is a win for the state’s economy, which will see a boom in innovation and investment. It’s a win for environmental justice, shifting state funding to those most vulnerable. And it’s a win for the climate.

What remains to be seen are the longer-term reverberations this recent flurry of state action will produce. As of now, two of the nation’s three biggest state economies — the West Coast’s biggest and the East Coast’s biggest — are heading for carbon neutrality by midcentury. In between them, a patchwork of climate-forward states is forming.

Right now, it’s happening all and only where Democrats take overwhelming power. But at a certain point, the size of the market for zero-carbon technologies, and the investment that market attracts, will grow so large that other states will jump on board so they aren’t left behind. Companies are not going to want to make two versions of all their products, a dirty version and a clean version. They will want standards harmonized, and standards tend to get harmonized upward, as California has shown again and again.

This is what climate victory, if there is any such thing, is going to look like in the US. It’s not going to happen through persuasion, whereby the fossil fuel industry realizes the error of its ways and releases federal politicians from its grip. The Green New Deal is probably not going to be built in one grand spasm of federal action. Rather, if it happens at all, it will be through grinding out victories where Democrats control things — some states and lots and lots of cities — until economic and social tipping points are reached.

No one knows exactly when that might happen. But there’s no doubt that New York has just accelerated the schedule.",Subsistence - Physiology
https://www.nationalobserver.com/2019/04/23/news/new-york-citys-green-new-deal-music-quebecs-ears,New York,New York City's Green New Deal is music to Quebec's ears,"New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio's Green New Deal is music to the ears of Quebec Premier François Legault‏. Under de Blasio’s plan to tackle climate change, unveiled Monday, all city operations would run on 100 per cent “zero-emission Canadian hydropower” within five years. Negotiations would begin “right away” with the aim of signing a deal by the end of 2020. The mayor’s plan to source clean power from Canada is exactly the sort of thing that Quebec's right-leaning Coalition Avenir Québec government has been hoping for. Legault’s‏ strategy is to become the ""battery of the American northeast” by replacing U.S. fossil fuel power generation with zero-emission energy generated by Hydro-Québec.

The provincial utility has been undergoing a ""significant build-out"" since the early 2000s, according to a representative, adding massive amounts of surplus capacity totalling over 5000 megawatts, including the Romaine complex on the north shore of the St. Lawrence with four hydro dams averaging an annual output of 8.0 terawatt hours (TWh). “WOW! The Mayor of New York announces the relaunch of negotiations with Hydro-Québec,” Legault tweeted Monday. Quebec’s official office in New York also wrote in tweet that “we are excited that the city is looking to clean hydropower from Quebec to help meet its goals.” When it comes to beating climate change, the Trump administration is late to the fight. In fact...they may not show up at all.

Quebec will need to take advantage of new electric infrastructure, like several proposed high-voltage transmission lines, if it wants to export all the surplus power it is generating, as the lines the province currently uses are close to capacity during peak consumption hours. The utility has offered financing totalling roughly $40 million for a proposed 9.45 TWh transmission line to Massachusetts. But another proposed line to New York City would bring 8.3 TWh into the city's electric region, and is getting renewed attention thanks to de Blasio's announcement. ""We are looking forward to sitting down with members of Mayor de Blasio’s team in the near future to negotiate contract terms,"" said Hydro-Québec strategic communications advisor Lynn St. Laurent in an email to National Observer. ""Many items need to be addressed. Long-term contracts take time to negotiate."" St. Laurent said Hydro-Québec considered de Blasio's timeline of a deal by 2020 to be ""feasible"" and ""negotiations should begin shortly."" The utility sees the upcoming steps as ""very positive,"" she said. ""Hydro-Québec welcomes Mayor de Blasio’s commitment to pursuing a formal procurement and we are looking forward to discussions with the City of New York."" The plan by de Blasio, who is rumoured to be considering a U.S. presidential run in 2020, would create clean economy jobs and cut the city’s carbon pollution. By using the Green New Deal title, he is referencing an international movement to tie job growth with climate action that has been recently championed by many environment groups, particularly youth-based. South of the border, U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez brought the idea to the mainstream, where it has been embraced by several Democratic presidential hopefuls including Senators Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris and Bernie Sanders. WOW! Le maire de New-York annonce la relance des négociations avec Hydro-Québec.

Quebec Energy and Natural Resources Minister Jonatan Julien has predicted such a contract with New York would bring tens of billions of dollars in revenue for Hydro-Québec, the Journal de Québec reported on Tuesday. Julien welcomed the announcement in a statement, saying the decision by New York City ""demonstrates the undeniable attractiveness of Quebec's renewable and clean electricity to our neighbours in terms of reducing their carbon footprint."" The Champlain Hudson Power Express (CHPE), the proposed transmission line to the Big Apple, would have a ""cumulative market value of $19.9 billion in the first 30 years of operation"" according to a 2017 analysis commissioned by the proponent.

It would also ""reduce CO2 emissions attributed to the State of New York by over 100 million metric tons,"" the analysis stated. Albany-based Transmission Developers Inc. (TDI) has been looking to lock down contracts so it can sell capacity on the CHPE line in order to help finance the project. It would run two cables underground, and underwater through Lake Champlain and along the Hudson and other rivers. While it was previously delayed over route changes, construction is now expected to start next year, National Observer has reported. TDI and the Blackstone Group, the Manhattan investment firm that is providing equity funding, said in a joint statement reacting to the mayor’s announcement that the CHPE was ""fully permitted"" and ""ready to supply New York with 1,000 MW of clean, renewable power."" ""We look forward to working with the city and state during the formal procurement process and to being a part of New York's cleaner, greener future,"" the companies said, adding the project “will create jobs, improve local air quality and more than double the amount of carbon-free power in New York City's energy supply."" Spokesman John Lacey said the firms would not be commenting further beyond their statement. Le Québec et @nycgov , un duo gagnant pour un virage vert!

CHPE is one example of how this could be done, the utility has said. The New York City plan may also be good for the Apuiat Wind Project, a 200 megawatt, 50-turbine project partially on the Innu Takuaikan Uashat Mak Mani-Utenam First Nation on Quebec's north shore, near Port-Cartier. The $600-million project was criticized by Legault while running for premier. However on Tuesday, Julien, the provincial energy minister, said Apuiat would be the next Hydro-Québec project, and that it ""will take place"" as soon as the surpluses begin to be drawn down. Legault has also pitched his power export plan to Ontario Premier Doug Ford. The Quebec premier said in November that he had offered to sell hydroelectricity to Ontario at cheaper rates than it would cost for Ontario to refurbish its aging fleet of nuclear reactors. In December at a Montreal meeting of premiers, along with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, National Observer reported that Legault continuously brought the focus back to Quebec’s surplus of hydroelectricity. St. Laurent said Quebec sent 6.8 TWh of energy to Ontario in 2018, and still has available transmission capacity between the Hydro-Québec system and Ontario’s. The province currently has a contract through 2023 for up to two TWh annually. But Ontario isn't asking for more, she said. ""For now, Ontario has not expressed any additional energy needs.""

Half of its energy is generated within city limits, with the rest flowing to the city. The high-voltage lines that currently run into the city from the north are at capacity. The city plans to “pursue an investment in new transmission to access large-scale Canadian hydropower at a competitive price.” It will have to do this in cooperation with the state, the New York Power Authority and the New York Independent System Operator, it said. “The city, working with partners, will pursue 100 per cent carbon-free electricity supply for city government operations with the building of a new connection linking New York City to zero-emission Canadian hydropower,” de Blasio’s office stated. “Negotiations will begin right away, with the goal of striking a deal by the end of 2020 and powering city operations entirely with renewable sources of electricity within five years. This action is the equivalent of converting the entire state of Vermont to clean energy.” While the state has already committed to 100 per cent clean power by 2040, the plan would also take New York City’s electricity grid to 50 per cent renewables by 2030. De Blasio’s Green New Deal policies are contained in “OneNYC 2050.” The mayor said the plan meets the reality of climate change “head on.” ""We are confronting the same interests that created the climate crisis and deepened inequality. There's no time to waste. We're taking action now, before it's too late,” he said.

https://www.cityandstateny.com/articles/policy/energy-environment/can-new-york-hit-its-environmental-goals.html,New York,Can New York hit its environmental goals?,"Once Gov. Andrew Cuomo signs the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act into law, as he is expected to, New York will have adopted a series of ambitious goals to mitigate climate change. But the state has a spotty history of meeting climate-related goals, from increasing the state’s use of renewable energy to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.

In 2004, the state created the now-obsolete Renewable Portfolio Standard but failed to meet its targets. It set a share of the state’s energy portfolio that should come from renewable sources such as wind and solar by 2013 and 2015. The original goal set in 2004 aimed to generate 25% of the state’s electrical energy from renewable sources by 2013, an increase from the 19.3% the state produced in 2004. (The vast majority of New York’s existing renewable energy production is hydropower, but there is limited potential for growth in hydro.) In 2010, the state upped that goal to produce 30% of electrical energy from renewable sources. The state came close in 2013 with about 23% renewable energy, but fell well short in 2015 when it was still stuck at 23%. According to the most recent New York State Independent System Operator Power Trends report, today, the state only produces about 26% of its electricity from renewable sources, meaning that it had still not quite hit the 2015 goal.

Although the 2004 and 2010 laws predate Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s tenure, their lack of successful implementation illustrates the potential pitfalls of the state’s hopes to transform its power sector.

After the Renewable Portfolio Standard, Cuomo introduced the state’s current program, the Clean Energy Standard. It set a goal of creating 50% of the state’s electricity by 2030. Cuomo proposed upping that target to 70%, a goal that was written into the new climate law as well and will soon be codified. The state’s slow rate of renewable energy growth had already put into question the feasibility of hitting the original 50% goal, and makes the 70% goal appear impossible without dramatic growth of solar and wind energy deployment. Over the course of Cuomo’s tenure so far, the state increased its renewable energy by less than 10% – in 2011, when he took office, the state was at 19% renewable.

The Clean Energy Standard is a part of Cuomo’s larger Reforming the Energy Vision initiative, which includes energy production targets: 2,400 megawatts offshore wind by 2030, 1,500 megawatts of storage by 2025 and 3 gigawatts of solar by 2023. Cuomo increased those targets this year, creating new goals of 9,000 megawatts of offshore wind by 2035, increasing distributed solar deployment to 6,000 megawatts by 2025 and 3,000 megawatts of storage by 2030. Currently, the state has 8,480 megawatts of proposed solar energy, with only 1,809 megawatts currently available. New York also has 4,036 megawatts in proposed storage, but only 56 megawatts right now. (The ability to store energy so that solar or wind energy can still be used when the sun is not shining or the wind is not blowing is essential to achieving an all-renewable energy sector.) The state also produces no offshore wind energy, but produces 1,985 megawatts of energy from land-based wind farms. The state took a large step forward in meeting the energy-procurement goals with $1.4 billion awarded to 26 large-scale renewable energy projects in 2018, including 22 solar farms.

The state has had difficulty increasing its wind energy output, which has remained largely stagnant over the past several years, due in part to what developers consider a burdensome approval process. Many concerns revolve around the aesthetic of wind turbines and local habitat preservation. New York has so far procured only 90 megawatts of offshore wind, approved in 2017. The project has since been expanded to 130 megawatts and is expected to begin construction in 2021, although it still awaits final federal approval. The state was set to announce in spring a second procurement of up to 1,200 megawatts after receiving several bids in February of this year, but that announcement has been delayed and has no dates as to when those projects may begin or be completed.

The newly passed Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act also includes a goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions 85% from 1990 levels by 2050 across all economic sectors, but the state has theoretically been working to reduce emissions 80% by the same year since 2009. That year, then-Gov. David Paterson signed an executive order creating the target, as well as a Climate Action Council to create a plan to reach it. Peter Iwanowicz, executive director of Environmental Advocates of New York, said that after Cuomo took over in 2011, that plan fell by the wayside.

In 2015, Cuomo signed his own executive order reaffirming to 80% reduction of emissions by 2050, with a milestone of 40% reduction by 2030. Both were cornerstones of his Clean Energy Standard and Reforming the Energy Vision established the same year. In 2018, the state released a greenhouse gas inventory: in 2015, New York had only reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 8% below 1990 levels.

While much of the more public efforts have been around the renewable energy goals, Reforming the Energy Vision includes a number of other projects that would help to address the broader emission goals, such as making buildings more energy efficient and decreasing the reliance on fossil fuels in the transportation sector. For example, the state has been working to expand its network of electric vehicle charging stations to encourage more consumers to use electric or hybrid cars, which will be key if New York aims to reduce overall carbon emissions 85%. There was a goal set for 3,000 electric vehicle charging stations across the state by 2018. As of 2017, the last year data for which data is available, the state created 700 new stations thanks to projects awards in 2012 and 2013, bringing the total number of charging stations to 1,700.

In 2018, the governor announced a $4.2 million investment to achieve a new goal to have 10,000 electric vehicle charging stations by 2021 in order to support the 850,000 electric vehicles the Cuomo would like the state to have by 2025 and 2 million by 2030. The state had about 37,000 electric vehicles on the road in 2018.

Julie Tighe, president of the League of Conservation Voters, acknowledged that certain projects are not moving as quickly as many advocates would like, but she feels confident that as the state continues to dedicate more time and money to getting those projects done, they will be able to get off the ground quicker. “There is no question that there is a pathway to achieving these goals within the timeline that has been proposed, or the governor wouldn’t have proposed them in the first place,” Tighe said. She added that the advancements will likely come in big jumps, rather than a smooth line.

Iwanowicz was not quite as optimistic. He said that, overall, the state has not done well in meeting its environmental and climate-related goals, from energy procurement to emissions reductions, in large part because action has almost exclusively come from executive orders rather than through laws in collaboration with the state Legislature. “You look at Rhode Island, they lead the nation in per capita energy efficiency. It's because their legislature’s involved in the process,” Iwanowicz said. “You're seeing the success of that shared responsibility.”

Iwanowicz said that he and other members of the coalition group New York Renews have never been confident that goals set in executive orders will ultimately be met, and that they need the power of law, and consequences for inaction, in order to happen. That was why the group has long been pushing the Climate and Community Protection Act, which evolved and changed names slightly when it passed. “The law really has to be aggressively watchdogged, implemented, and then enforced, so that we do hit the 70% (renewable energy goal). But the pathway is clear,” Iwanowicz said.

https://altamontenterprise.com/08222019/will-new-york-produce-enough-renewable-energy-time-meet-its-deadlines,New York,Will New York produce enough renewable energy in time to meet its deadlines?,"NEW SCOTLAND — With the signing into law of the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act last month, New York out-California’ed the Golden State by approving a “historic” and “landmark” piece of legislation that has been hailed not only as the most “aggressive,” “progressive,” and “ambitious” climate plan in the country but also the world.

The new law requires the state to cut its greenhouse-gas emissions 85 percent by 2050. No small feat considering that, according to the most recent available data, New York State between 1990 and 2016 had reduced carbon emissions by just 13.5 percent.

And, if that weren’t enough, the state’s Clean Energy Standard says that, by 2030, seventy percent of New York’s electricity has to come from renewable energy sources. By 2040, the new law says, the state’s electricity sector is to be “100-percent carbon-free.”

With its Clean Energy Standard, New York joins California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Washington, as states that, by statute, will have 100 percent of electricity generation from carbon-free sources by the middle of the century.

New York State currently gets around 60 percent of its electricity from carbon-free sources; about one-third comes from nuclear power and about 30 percent comes from renewables, according to the United States Energy Information Administration. Carbon-emitting natural-gas-powered plants generate about 40 percent of the state’s electricity, according to the Energy Information Administration.

Getting to an 85-percent cut in carbon emissions could mean fundamentally changing the way many New Yorkers live their lives. The state’s transportation sector, for example, accounted for 37 percent of greenhouse-gas emissions in 2016, according to the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority. That was followed by “on-site” combustion — heating — in the residential, commercial, and industrial sectors, which made up 30 percent of the state’s carbon emissions.

All told, according to NYSERDA, fossil-fuel combustion accounted for 81-percent of total greenhouse-gas emissions in New York State in 2016.

In the coming week, The Enterprise will look at one possibility for trapping greenhouse-gas emissions that, according to a professor of agricultural science at Cornell University, if it were added to 10 percent of global cropland, could trap all of the greenhouse gas emitted by humanity on an annual basis.

This week, The Enterprise examines at how the state, its utilities, and municipalities are looking to wean themselves off of fossil fuels. New Scotland, for example, is taking advantage of incentives to turn dump lands into solar arrays.

Renewables

In 2018, renewable energy sources accounted for about 28 percent of all the electricity generated in New York State, according to the United States Energy Information Administration. And the majority — about 81 percent — of that 28 percent was from hydropower.

Electricity from wind power accounted for about 3.2 percent of all the power generated in the state in 2018, while energy generated from solar sources accounted for about 1.4 percent.

The state’s push to have 70 percent of its electricity come from renewable energy sources by 2030 looks especially ambitious considering the nuclear-powered Indian Point Energy Center — which generates 12 percent of all the electricity in the state — is scheduled for complete closure by April 2021; that means the current 60 percent of electricity in the state coming from carbon-free sources, will soon be closer to half.

To get to the 70-percent threshold, the state has instituted certain mandates and coupled them with huge investments in renewable-energy projects.

In April 2018, a report from NYSERDA and the New York State Department of Public Service, established energy-efficiency targets for the state’s investor-owned utilities, which would require the utilities to “reduce energy consumption” in the state by the “equivalent to fueling and powering 1.8 million New York homes by 2025,” which would account for about 5 percent of what was forecast to be state’s total primary energy use in 2025.

Additionally, the April 2018 report said, the reduction in energy consumption would “deliver nearly one-third of the [greenhouse gas] reductions needed to meet the State’s climate goal…”

In December 2018, the New York Public Service Commission issued an order based on the April 2018 report. In addition, the PSC set an energy — or battery — storage goal of 1,500 megawatts of electricity by 2025, which is enough to power 1.2 million average-sized homes; by 2030, the PSC set an energy-storage goal of 3,000 megawatts.

The Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act says that 9,000 megawatts of offshore wind are to be installed by 2035; currently, zero megawatts of offshore wind have been installed off of the state’s coast. There are, however, about 2,000 megawatts of wind power located in upstate New York.

During the signing of the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, Governor Andrew Cuomo announced that, at nearly 1,700 megawatts, the state had executed the country’s largest offshore wind agreement as well as the largest renewable energy procurement by a single state in the nation’s history. The two wind projects, which are to be built off the coast of Long Island, according to NYSERDA, “will produce enough electricity to power more than one million New York homes.”

The new law also calls for 6,000 megawatts of solar to be installed in the state by 2025. As of the end of July, according to NYSERDA, about 30 percent of the state’s solar-install goal had already been met. In addition, there were another 1,077-megawatts worth of projects in the works. In Albany County since 2000, there have been 3,795 commercial, industrial, and residential solar installations, accounting for about 78 megawatts of power.

According to NYSERDA’s Clean Energy Standard Annual Progress Report: 2017 Compliance Year, which was issued in February of this year, in 2017, the statewide electric load was 153,163,000 megawatts; about 72 percent, or 110,080,000 megawatts, was generated from non-renewable sources.

By 2030, the state’s clean energy standard says that statewide electric load can be no more than 140,992,000 megawatts; 70 percent, or 98,694,400 megawatts, are to be generated from renewable sources.

Currently, however, between existing sources and projects in the works, only 53,967,000 megawatts of renewable energy can be accounted for, which means between now and 2030, another 44,727,000 megawatts of renewable energy will have to come online.

“Decarbonizing power generation” will not be enough for New York State to meet its greenhouse-gas emission goals, according to an analysis of the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act by McKinsey and Company.

New Scotland’s solar

In July 2017, amid an influx of inquiries into large-scale solar development, rural-turning-suburban town of New Scotland passed a local law governing solar energy with the primary goal of preserving farmland and open space. In December 2018, New Scotland’s Planning Board approved the town’s first large-scale solar farm.

When complete, the 1.875-megawatt ground-mounted solar system at 331 New Scotland South Road will generate enough energy to power about 350 homes for one year, according to the site’s developer.

At its August meeting, the New Scotland Town Board approved a request from Solomon Energy, a Connecticut-based energy advisory firm, to allow the company to solicit on behalf of the town proposals to install solar arrays on two town-owned landfills.

In 2018, NYSERDA published a new solar guidebook to help municipalities develop projects on underused properties like landfills and brownfields. The state’s Department of Environmental Conservation also adopted new rules that made it easier to install solar arrays on the underused properties. Additionally, revisions were made to the financial incentives provided for developing projects in landfills and brownfields.

The first New Scotland site is located at 237 Upper Flatrock Road and is the home of the town’s transfer station. The property is about 62 acres of which approximately 30 acres would be available for development. The second site is a 9.7-acre capped landfill located near the intersection of Upper Flatrock Road and Delaware Avenue; the entire property is available to be developed.

What makes Solomon Energy’s proposal so attractive to New Scotland is that all of the development responsibility is placed on the company, but the ultimate say over the project’s fate remains with the town, which would receive a monthly rent check from the solar developer should the project get to that point.

“The Town is attempting to utilize the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority NY-Sun Incentive Program which provides financial incentives for the installation of new grid-connected solar photovoltaic systems,” Solomon’s proposal states.

The NY-Sun public-private partnership program was started in 2012 to help increase the state’s capacity of renewable solar energy. In 2014, Governor Cuomo announced a billion-dollar investment in the program that, according to NYSERDA, “would spur development of a market-driven, sustainable, subsidy-free solar industry” while also launching “the statewide NY-Sun Incentive Program to help reach these goals.”

Through March 31, according to NYSERDA, the NY-Sun program has funded the installation of 844 megawatts of solar with another 992 megawatts of projects in the works. Between pending and expended funds, the program has burned through close to three-quarters of its initial billion-dollar investment.

NYSERDA says that NY-Sun-funded solar projects across the state, as of March 31, generate almost a million megawatt-hours of electricity each year, which reduces carbon emissions by half-a-million metric tons.

Landfill-located solar farms acquired the sobriquet “brightfields” in 1999, when the United States Department of Energy launched a new initiative aimed at repurposing contaminated sites around the country for the production of pollution-free solar energy.

“This novel concept,” according to the Department of Energy, “addresse[d] three of the nation’s greatest challenges: climate change, urban revitalization, and toxic waste cleanup.”

The number of operational landfills in the United States has dropped by about 78 percent over roughly the past three decades, according to the most recently available data from the Environmental Protection Agency, from about 7,900 in 1988 to about 1,740 in 2015. During the same period, the number of active landfills in New York State went from 227 in 1988 to 27 today.

All of these closed-down landfills — “plus portions of active landfills with closed cells” — mean millions and millions of acres are available for solar development, about 15 million, in fact, according to the EPA.

“Solar’s abundance and potential throughout the United States is staggering,” according to the Department of Energy, if solar panels were installed on “just 0.6 percent of the nation’s total land area” — about 210,000 square miles or 13.4 million square acres — “[that] could supply enough electricity to power the entire United States.”

Landfills are well-suited for solar development, according to the EPA, because they are often:

— Located near critical infrastructure like roads and transmission lines;

— Located near large population bases, which are areas with high energy demands

— Built on flat surfaces, which are optimal for siting solar photovoltaic structures;

— Offered at lower land costs; and

— Able to accommodate utility-scale projects.

To date, the EPA has identified 289 contaminated lands, landfills, and mine sites across the country that contain a total of 311 renewable energy installations, which have a cumulative electricity-generating capacity of 1,561 megawatts. In addition, the EPA is tracking another 90 renewable-energy projects that are in various stages of planning, approval, or construction.

With 25 installations, New York State has the third-most renewable energy projects in the country; Massachusetts is first with 108 and New Jersey is second with 40 renewable energy installations.

“The state of New York is finding ways to help encourage the development of renewable energy on brownfield and landfill sites,” the EPA notes. Through the NY-Sun program, the state has supported renewable energy installations on contaminated sites and landfills in Troy, Hoosick Falls, and Saratoga Springs.

The solar array at the Clifton Park landfill in Clifton Park, for example, is a town-owned facility where nine of the landfill’s 25 acres are covered in solar panels, which generate about 1 megawatt of power that is directed back into the electrical grid. Through a power-purchase agreement with the site’s solar developer, over a 25-year period, the town will reduce its own carbon footprint by about 90 percent and see up to $2.5 million in savings.

Although it’s not a contaminated site or a landfill, a 22-acre solar site on Becker Road near Altamont came online in May, which will allow the Guilderland Central School District, through a power purchase agreement with the site’s developer, Forefront Power, to offset 58 percent of the district’s annual energy consumption, while reducing operating expenses by $4.5 million over the next two decades.

About its potential landfill solar project, New Scotland Supervisor Douglas LaGrange told The Enterprise that the town’s “main concern is a lease agreement.” Solomon Energy’s request for proposal does, however, ask that bidders include an “off-taker statement,” or power-purchase agreement but it appears to be boilerplate language.

Right now, New Scotland wants to take advantage of its two municipally-owned landfills because, LaGrange said, the town felt there was an “excellent opportunity” with the incentives offered by the NY-Sun program as well as the financial incentives provided for developing projects in landfills and brownfields.

If a solar project were approved by New Scotland, the generous incentives currently being offered to solar developers by New York State could soon be passed on to the town in the form of increased compensation, the town board was told at its meeting in April by Michael Hamor who was speaking on behalf of Solomon Energy.

The town is looking for income from the solar farm, LaGrange said, because it is already pursuing savings for residents through other avenues, specifically, the town’s decision to enter into a Community Choice Aggregation administration agreement with the Municipal Electric and Gas Alliance, a not-for-profit development corporation, which could lead to a drop in residents’ electric bills.

LaGrange also pointed to another cost-saving project that has been in the works for some time, swapping out of the town’s current street lights for high-efficiency light-emitting-diode street lights.

“We’ve got a lot of irons in the fire; we’re trying to find every opportunity we can,” LaGrange said. ​",Subsistence - Physiology

By Natalie Sauer

Washington state will run completely on carbon neutral power by 2030 and New York City will spend $14bn on cutting its footprint, their governments announced on Monday.

The Big Apple and Western state respectively released a city-wide “Green New Deal” and clean power bill on Monday.

New York mayor Bill de Blasio unveiled a raft of proposals in a bid to cut greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 30% by 2030, the deadline set by UN scientists to limit warming to 1.5C.

“Every day we wait is a day our planet gets closer to the point of no-return. New York City’s Green New Deal meets that reality head on,” said de Blasio. “We are confronting the same interests that created the climate crisis and deepened inequality. There’s no time to waste. We’re taking action now, before it’s too late.”

The New York programme, dubbed OneNYC 2050, sets out to achieve carbon neutrality and 100% clean energy by 2050 by modernising the city’s buildings, transport, and boosting clean energy. In a global first, New York City will be ordering all existing buildings of 25,000 square feet or more, of which there are 50,000 across the city, to carry out energy upgrades in a bid to slash their emissions. Buildings account for 70% of the city’s carbon pollution. The plan bans inefficient all-glass constructions, many of which have defined the city’s iconic skyline. Such buildings will have to meet strict conditions to be built in future.

Moreover, the city’s administration will seek to power its operations from 100% clean energy by connecting the city to zero-emission Canadian hydropower. The entire raft of packages, which includes both new and already committed cash, will cost $14bn.

Cities and states in many parts of the US have been developing their own climate plans, spurred in part by the Trump White House’s efforts to undermine action to tackle the problem.

“We don’t have the benefit of a federal government to lead the way and we can’t wait for this president to wake up. It’s on us to make radical change,” said de Blasio.

Westward, the Washington state senate passed its own clean electricity legislation, which requires 100% of the state’s electricity to be carbon-neutral by 2030 and carbon-free by 2045. The bill, which has already passed the house, also requires state utilities to phase out coal power by 2025.

Championed by democratic governor and presidential candidate Jay Inslee, the bill also brings unions onboard by ensuring jobs in the renewables sector. It offers tax exemptions for projects that promote collective labour organising, local workforces, minority employment and high quality jobs.

“Washingtonians should be proud of their state’s climate leadership,” Mark Specht, an energy analyst at the Union of Concerned Scientists said. “As climate impacts increasingly affect the state’s forests, fisheries, coastlines and air quality, there is no time to waste to enact widescale, impactful change that will reduce carbon emissions. This bill will transform the state’s power grid and set a global example.”

“The switch to 100% clean energy will happen by increasing renewable power sources and energy efficiency,” Specht added. “State leaders wisely took the extra step of ensuring the bill included provisions to support low-income households via energy assistance programs.”

Hawaii, California, New Mexico and Puerto Rico have all spelt out 100% clean energy targets, with Illinois currently developing legislation to follow suit.

Hydropower and renewable sources currently account for three-quarters of Washington’s electricity.

The wind projects, to be built off the coast of Long Island, represent a big step forward for a technology that has been slow to take off in the United States because of local opposition and high costs. Experts have said offshore turbines, which are used extensively in Northern Europe, hold great promise because the wind tends to be stronger and more consistent offshore than on land.

Wind farms are a major energy source in the United States, providing about 7 percent of all electricity last year, up from about 2 percent in 2010. But almost all of those turbines are on land. By comparison, Britain expects to get 10 percent of its electricity from offshore wind next year, up from less than 1 percent in 2010.

The New York projects will start operation within the next five years and have the capacity to produce 1,700 megawatts of electricity, accounting for about 20 percent of Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s overall goal for offshore wind.",Subsistence - Physiology
https://www.cityandstateny.com/articles/policy/energy-environment/latest-new-york-bird-law-yes-s-thing.html,New York,"The latest in New York bird law. Yes, that’s a thing.","A whole flock of legislation dedicated to helping New York’s bird population has taken flight this year – and though not everyone is emu-sed by these new bills, others just can’t stop raven about them.

On Tuesday, the New York City Council passed a bill that will require new building developments be made with materials designed to prevent birds from flying into them. The new law is the result of years’ worth of lobbying by bird experts and advocates, The City reports.

“Every year, hundreds of thousands of birds in New York – including over 100 species that we know of – die brutally and unnecessarily as a result of collisions with reflective or transparent glass buildings,” Edita Birnkrant, executive director of New Yorkers for Clean, Livable, and Safe Streets, said at City Hall on Tuesday before the bill’s passage. “Birds are a critical part of our city’s ecosystem, and for too long we haven’t done enough to protect them.”

Earlier this year, the city also passed legislation to outlaw the sale of foie gras and bird trafficking – but the city isn’t the only place where bird-friendly laws have arisen. State Sen. Brad Hoylman has been working hard to pass a couple of bills focused on protecting the state’s birds this past year – though not all have made it past Gov. Andrew Cuomo.

You may be wondering what’s up with all of these new bird bills – and the simple answer is that these fragile creatures are in greater need of assistance than ever before. About 90,000 to 230,000 birds in New York City end up dying each year simply from crashing into buildings, according to the New York City Audubon. And it’s estimated that two-thirds of North American bird species are facing extinction, among them many species that call New York home.

Here’s everything you need to know about the Empire State’s latest bird-related legislation:

Bird-friendly materials bill

The city’s new local law, which is expected to go into effect December 2020, will require new buildings (or buildings set to be renovated) to use materials on windows that make them much easier for birds to see, for the first 75 feet of the building – where most collisions happen.

This can be as simple as using windows with ultraviolet glass that is only visible to birds, or putting simple designs, screens or shades on windows, according to The City. None of these new requirements are expected to seriously impact the design aesthetics of any new buildings, so architects can rest easy.

The “bird-friendly building council act""

This legislation, sponsored and pushed for by state Sen. Brad Hoylman, sought to create a state council tasked with determining building regulations with birds’ safety in mind for all of New York. The bill was vetoed by Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Nov. 20, after the governor said it would be too expensive to pass, though he did call it a ""laudatory pursuit.""

Harsher penalties for bird trafficking

On Oct. 30, the City Council instituted much more rigid penalties for trappers found guilty of capturing and transporting the city’s pigeons for out-of-state shoots. The iconic city birds have been illegally hauled to other states for years, for the sole purpose of being released and shot at organized pigeon shoots.

The flap over the foie gras ban

The City Council also passed a bill to outlaw foie gras on Oct. 30, which will prevent the sale of the controversial French delicacy, beginning in 2022. But since the legislation’s passing, duck farmers have been crying fowl.

Last week, the New York Post reported that upstate duck farmers are hoping Cuomo will intervene and prevent the city’s new bill from going into effect, claiming that it will severely harm their business. “It’s sad to think Mayor de Blasio signed a bill that was based mostly on misinformation and lies about how ducks are raised and processed at our New York facilities,” Sergio Saravia, president of La Belle Farms in the Hudson Valley, wrote in a letter penned to Cuomo.

It’s unclear how Cuomo will act regarding this matter, but a spokesperson for the state Department of Agriculture told the Post that it is aware of the letter and will make a decision on how to move forward once a formal request to review the local law has been received.

The birds and bees protection act

This Hoylman-sponsored bill, introduced to the Senate in May, aims to eradicate the sale of pesticides, known as neonics, that are harmful to a variety of pollinators, such as birds and bees.

The bill is still in the process of being reviewed by the Senate’s Environmental Conservation Committee, but environmental advocates, like the Natural Resources Defense Council, are hoping it’ll pass and give bees and birds alike a breather.","['Subsistence - Physiology', 'Affection - Aesthetics']"

More New Yorkers pay rent than the number of people who live in city of Los Angeles

New York is the most populous city in the US, and the majority of residents are paying rent as opposed to owning their own places.

Nearly two-thirds of residents in New York live in rent-occupied units, according to the New York City Department of City Planning. The number of people renting housing units in New York alone is more than twice the national average. Two thirds of New York’s 8.5 million residents is still larger than all the 4 million residents in Los Angeles, America’s second biggest city.

The average number of people staying in city shelters nightly peaked to a record of nearly 64,000 people in January 2019, according to a report by the Coalition for the Homeless.

That’s 17,000 more than the capacity of Yankee Stadium, which can hold 47,309 people.

The coalition projects that the number of homeless people seeking shelter in the city will continue to climb to more than 65,000 by 2022.

Manhattan homes are currently left on the market for an average of four months

Although the New York real estate market can be notoriously competitive, Manhattan homes actually end up staying on the market longer than you might expect.

Across all five boroughs, New Yorkers trying to sell their homes are facing longer and longer wait times to reach final sales, according to StreetEasy Market Reports. Manhattan homes in particular spent an average of 117 days on the market, the highest figure the city has seen in seven years.

Even the cheapest Manhattan neighborhood has an average rent of more than $1,600

The least expensive rents in Manhattan can be found in the neighborhood of Inwood at the northern tip of the island. But even there, residents are still paying $1,623 a month, according to City Realty.

In nearby Washington Heights, renters can find a studio for an average of $1,669, making it the second cheapest neighborhood.

According to StreetEasy market reports, there’s only one area of the entire city where rents fell in the first quarter of 2018.

That would be North Brooklyn, where a surplus of property remained empty as an impending shutdown of the local subway line approached. Rents in the market fell to $3,061, a mere drop of 0.5% from the previous quarter.

Those rents very well may go back up, now that city officials announced the subway shutdown would be partially averted.

Less than a quarter of housing units in Brooklyn are offering cuts on rent

With fewer people buying and more renting, New York landlords have the upper hand, and are less likely to offer markdowns to prospective tenants.

In Brooklyn, rent cuts are down 6.7% from last year, according to a 2019 StreetEasy report. The trend of shrinking rent cuts is true across Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens. Rent cuts dropped to the smallest discount on record in Brooklyn and Queens, each at 3.4% and dipping close to an all-time low in Manhattan at 3.9%.

The percentage of homes for sale is up 11.7%

The total number of homes for sale in Manhattan increased 11.7% year-over-year, according to StreetEasy. Inventory grew across the borough, with Upper Manhattan gaining the largest relative share of new inventory at 18.4%.

https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/12/nyregion/rent-regulation-laws-new-york.html,New York,Rent Regulations in New York: How They’ll Affect Tenants and Landlords,"Rent control in the city became popular after World War II when soldiers returned home and sought apartments for their families. The demand caused rents to increase, leading to a housing shortage. At its height, more than two million rent-controlled apartments existed in the city, but only a small fraction remain: about 22,000, according to a 2017 survey.

For an apartment to be rent-controlled, a tenant or family member must have been living in the unit since at least July 1971, and the building had to have been built before 1947. Families can pass the unit to another member and preserve the rent-control status. A unit that falls out of rent control can be leased at market rate.

The second system, rent stabilization, applies generally to apartments in buildings with at least six units that were built between 1947 and 1974, buildings of that size built before 1947 where an apartment was leased after June 1971, and newer buildings that receive tax breaks for so-called affordable housing.

Rent increases at stabilized units are determined by the city’s Rent Guidelines Board. This year the board allowed for 1.5 percent increases for one-year leases and 2.5 percent for two-year leases.

What do the new changes mean for tenants?

Tenants in rent-regulated apartments would largely see an end to big rent increases under the new legislation. The Rent Guidelines Board will continue to determine yearly increases on rent-stabilized units, but the following rules that benefited landlords would be changed or abolished:

Vacancy decontrol: When the legal rent for a rent-stabilized apartment reached a certain rate, currently $2,774 per month, it could revert to market-rate if there is a vacancy. The rule has led to the deregulation of more than 155,000 units since it was enacted in the 1990s. This practice would be ended.

The vacancy bonus: Landlords for rent-stabilized apartments have been able to hike rents by as much as 20 percent after tenants moved out. The new rules would prevent that.

Rent hikes based on building improvements: Landlords have been able to increase rents in regulated apartments by up to 6 percent per year if they made improvements that “directly or indirectly” benefited all tenants, such as a new boiler. That increase would now be capped at 2 percent per year. Rent hikes that were permitted if landlords renovated or improved individual apartments would also now be limited.

Misuse of “preferential” rents: Landlords of rent-stabilized apartments can offer units to tenants for a price lower than the legal regulated rent. But they can no longer raise the rent to the legally mandated limit when a lease is renewed, a practice that was pushing tenants out.

High-income deregulation: If a tenant in a rent-stabilized unit earned over $200,000 a year in two consecutive years, the landlord could deregulate the unit. That will no longer be allowed.

The “owner-use” loophole: Landlords and their family members have been able to remove rent-stabilized tenants from multiple units to use them as residences, a rule sometimes abused by landlords as a way to ultimately raise rents. Now, landlords will only be able to claim “owner use” for one apartment for use as their primary residence.

What do the changes mean for landlords?

Trade groups and real estate lobbyists warned of dire consequences as a result of the new regulations. They said smaller landlords could be run out of business because of new limits on rent increases and restrictions on raising rent after improvements. Ultimately, they said, units and buildings could fall into disrepair.

Some analysts predicted that the New York housing market overall could be depressed because the resale market for rent-regulated apartments would lose value as a result of the changes.

The Real Estate Board of New York, an influential trade group that primarily represents larger developers, predicted that building owners would no longer have an incentive to invest in their rent-regulated units.",['Subsistence - Living Space']
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/03/nyregion/nyc-airbnb-rentals.html,New York,Judge Blocks New York City Law Aimed at Curbing Airbnb Rentals,"Jacob Tugendrajch, a spokesman for Mr. Johnson, called the law a “vital protection against illegal hotels” and said the Council would continue “the fight for this common sense, data-driven law.”

Mr. de Blasio has contrasted home-sharing services with the hotel industry, which is subject to inspections and regulations that allow the city to hold owners accountable. He has argued that Airbnb should also be required to turn over information that helps the city protect the public interest.

An influential union for hotel workers, the Hotel Trades Council, strongly backed the law.

In a 52-page ruling, Judge Engelmayer did not rule on the merits of Airbnb and HomeAway’s claims, but said the injunction would block the law from taking effect pending resolution of the litigation, which he said would proceed expeditiously.

The law would require online rental services to disclose the addresses of its listings and the identities of its hosts to the city’s Office of Special Enforcement on a monthly basis. Hosts would also be required to list whether the dwelling is their primary residence and whether the entire unit or a portion is available for short-term rentals. Companies that failed to share the data would be subject to fines of $1,500 for each listing they did not disclose.

New York City is Airbnb’s largest domestic market, with more than 50,000 apartment rental listings. But under state law, it is illegal in most buildings for an apartment to be rented out for less than 30 days unless the permanent tenant is residing in the apartment at the same time.

City officials hoped the new disclosure requirements would make it much easier for the city to enforce the state law and would lead to thousands of units rented through Airbnb in the city coming off the market.

Airbnb and other home-rental services have been battling regulation nationally and abroad, as cities including Seattle, San Francisco and London have required such companies to share some data through a registration system for listings.",['Subsistence - Living Space']
https://ny.curbed.com/2019/8/21/20813581/nyc-homelessness-crisis-housing-plan-affordable-units-report,New York,New York City’s housing plan falls short on addressing homelessness crisis: report,"It’s been almost two years since the de Blasio administration launched Housing New York 2.0, a plan to combat the city’s affordable housing crisis by creating or preserving 300,000 affordable homes by 2026. Since 2014, when Mayor Bill de Blasio took office, his administration has financed a total of 135,437 affordable homes.

But with the city in the grips of a deepening affordability and homelessness crisis, advocates are questioning the effectiveness of those efforts.

A new report by Coalition for the Homeless charges that instead of addressing those intertwined issues, the city’s housing plan in fact exacerbates the city’s divided housing market. In 2017, for instance, there were around 560,000 more households in need of low-rent apartments than there were affordable ones on the market. Between 1999 and 2017, the city lost more than one million apartments renting for less than $800/month. (The study does not specifically define what “affordable” means; researchers for the group used $800/month or less as a threshold because it’s the lowest figure recorded by the 2017 New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey).

The chart below shows the gap between households with an annual income below $34,000/year (the poverty threshold in NYC for a two-adult, two-child family is $32,402/year) versus vacant or occupied apartments renting for $800/month or less.

The report also claims that while the housing market lost low-rent apartments, the number of what the coalition considers high-rent units, costing more than $2,000/month, increased significantly, which resulted in “vastly different market conditions for low- and high-income renters.”

In 2017, the analysis found, apartments renting for $800/month or less had a vacancy rate of 1.15 percent, while apartments renting for more than $2,000/month had a vacancy rate of 7.42 percent, showing an excess supply of those high-priced units.

During a rally at City Hall, advocates from several organizations including Coalition for the Homeless held signs that compared NYC’s homelessness numbers—in June, around 60,849 homeless people slept in the city’s shelter system each night—to the total populations of several cities in the U.S., including White Plains, New York, which has 58,111 residents.

“[Mayor Bill de Blasio] is spending billions of dollars on a housing plan that will only exacerbate this crisis, it will continue to feed the glut of high-rent units in New York City and do nothing to bridge the gap between stagnated wages and increasing rents,” Giselle Routhier, policy director at Coalition for the Homeless, said during the rally.

Routhier added that there are 17,887 single adults living in shelters and only 16,480 apartments for rent at the CityFHEPS—the city’s rental assistance voucher program— subsidy level for studios.

“We cannot voucher our way out of this crisis,” Routhier added. “We need new construction, we need to expand the housing supply—without action we will continue to see ever-growing homelessness.”

Advocates called on the city to build 24,000 new apartments specifically for homeless New Yorkers and preserve affordability of 6,000 already-occupied ones, as part of the Housing New York 2.0 plan. This, according to the report, would allow thousands of families and individuals to leave shelters each year, move into permanent housing, and “put the City on a trajectory to actually reduce homelessness for the first time in 15 years.”

At the rally, activists spoke about their experiences looking for affordable housing in the city while experiencing homelessness.

“I went on Housing Connect only to find out that I didn’t have enough money, at my full-time job, to qualify for affordable housing,” Camee Lee, a Neighbors Together advocate, said. “We need to focus on New Yorkers living below the poverty line.”

A spokesperson for the de Blasio administration stood by the city’s Housing Plan and what it has accomplished since it was launched.

“We have been building homeless housing at a faster rate than ever before, and this year we’ve produced a record number of homes for some of the most vulnerable New Yorkers,” Avery Cohen, deputy press secretary for the Office of the Mayor, told Curbed in a statement. “Between unprecedented investments in legal services, rental assistance and rehousing programs, we’re laser focused on getting the maximum number of families out of shelters and into homes.”","['Subsistence - Living Space', 'Creation - Affordability']"

Rockland County declared a state of emergency on Tuesday and said the ban would remain in place for 30 days or until unvaccinated children get the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) shot.

The Rockland announcement follows measles outbreaks in California, Illinois, Texas and Washington and is part of a global resurgence of the viral infection, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

""We will not sit idly by while children in our community are at risk,"" County Executive Ed Day said in a statement. ""This is a public health crisis, and it is time to sound the alarm.""

There have been 153 confirmed cases of measles in Rockland County, about 11 miles (18 km) north of Manhattan, mostly among children who have not been vaccinated.

The ban begins at midnight after which unvaccinated children will not be permitted in locations such as places of worship, schools and shopping malls. Outdoor spaces like playgrounds are excluded from the ban. People medically unable to get vaccinated are exempt.

The outbreak began when a traveler visited Israel and returned to a predominantly ultra-Orthodox Jewish neighborhood of Rockland County. There have also been at least 181 confirmed cases of measles in the New York boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens since October, mostly among Orthodox Jews, according to the city's health department.

The New York and Washington outbreaks began after U.S. travelers picked up measles in foreign countries, where the disease was running rampant, and brought it back to places where vaccination rates were too low by U.S. public health standards.

The disease has spread mostly among school-age children whose parents declined to get them vaccinated, citing reasons such as philosophical or religious beliefs, or concerns the MMR vaccine could cause autism, authorities said.

Large scientific studies have demonstrated that there is no link between vaccines and autism.

Officials say the measles outbreaks offer a lesson about the importance of maintaining a minimum 95 percent ""herd"" level of immunization against dangerous, preventable diseases such as measles. Rates as low as 60 percent were found in parts of New York where measles spread, State Health Commissioner Howard Zucker said in February.",['Protection - Health']
https://www.cityandstateny.com/articles/politics/new-york-state/new-yorks-efforts-to-snuff-out-smoking.html,New York,New York’s efforts to snuff out smoking,"Gov. Andrew Cuomo is determined to extinguish flavored e-cigarettes in New York.

On Sunday, he announced an emergency executive action to ban the sale of flavored e-cigarettes, in light of recent mysterious ailments and deaths across the country connected to vaping. It’s reported that 64 cases of lung disease due to vaping have occured in New York alone.

Though it’s not yet clear what’s causing the rash of illnesses – whether it’s from products like flavored e-cigarettes or from users vaping chemicals mixed with illegally obtained marijuana – state Health Commissioner Howard Zucker and the state’s Public Health and Health Planning Council will be meeting this week to ban flavored e-cigarettes.

“New York is confronting this crisis head on and today we are taking another nation-leading step to combat a public health emergency,” Cuomo said Sunday. “Manufacturers of fruit and candy-flavored e-cigarettes are intentionally and recklessly targeting young people, and today we’re taking action to put an end to it.”

Cuomo’s move to ban flavored tobacco products may seem like a knee-jerk reaction, but it’s completely in alignment with New York’s efforts over the years to rid the state of tobacco products. From New York City’s ban on smoking in bars and restaurants in 2002 to the rise of the legal smoking age from 18 to 21 statewide in 2018, New York has made its feelings on tobacco loud and clear.

The reason for New York’s fixation? Health, of course. By decreasing New Yorkers’ secondhand smoke exposure and making it more difficult to buy or smoke cigarettes, the state hopes to reduce the number of smoking-related deaths per year – currently estimated around 12,000 in New York alone. Here’s a timeline of New York’s smoking restrictions to get you more acquainted with the city and state’s efforts to kick the habit:

1987: New York imposes public smoking regulations

The state Public Health Council limited smoking in public places, such as offices with more than two employees and most restaurants (those with more than 50 seats).

2002: Smoking banned in bars and restaurants in New York City

New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg signed a law that banned all smoking in bars and restaurants – with a few exceptions, like cigar bars. The city had banned most smoking in restaurants in 1995, but still allowed it in the bar areas of restaurants.

2002: Increased tobacco taxation begins in New York City

The same year as the New York City bar and restaurant smoking ban, both the city and state increased taxes on cigarettes, which raised the price 32% from $5.20 to $6.85 a pack. Cigarettes in New York City had the highest combined city and state tax in the United States at the time.

2003: Smoking banned in offices, bars and restaurants statewide

The introduction of the state Clean Indoor Air Act made it illegal to smoke in offices, on public transportation, and in bars and restaurants, among other locations, to minimize secondhand smoke exposure. In 2017, the act was amended to include the prohibition of e-cigarettes and vaping products as well.

2011: New York City bans smoking in public

Bloomberg passed another measure to ban smoking in public spaces like parks, beaches, pools, recreation centers and various pedestrian plazas in New York City.

2013: New York City raises the age to purchase tobacco products

The New York City Council passed a bill to raise the legal age required to purchase tobacco products from 18 to 21. Officials said that the younger people are when they begin smoking, the more likely they are to become addicted to tobacco.

2018: Price minimums introduced for tobacco products

Mandatory price minimums for tobacco products went into effect, forcing tobacco vendors to raise the prices of their products. Now, cigarettes must be sold at a minimum of $13 per pack – and vendors must apply for an electronic cigarette retail dealer license if they want to sell any type of vaping product.

2019: State raises the smoking age to 21

In July, Cuomo signed legislation to raise the legal tobacco smoking age from 18 to 21 throughout the state, which will go into effect in November. The measure includes all tobacco products as well as vaping products and e-cigarettes. New York and 17 other states have passed laws to raise the legal smoking age to 21.

2019: Flavored tobacco products banned

Cuomo announced a move to ban flavored e-cigarettes and vaping products statewide, amid a recent rise in vaping-related illnesses and deaths that have medical professionals stumped. The New York City Council had already been pushing for a ban on these products. Concerns over the sale of these products escalated after recent reports revealed a heavy spike in children using flavored tobacco and vaping products in the city.",['Protection - Health']
https://ny.curbed.com/2019/11/22/20977760/new-york-free-parking-streets,New York,It’s time to end NYC’s free parking giveaway,"Imagine what New York City could do with 500 million square feet of public space.

Imagine how much more room for people and housing and parks New York City would have if more than 10,000 football fields’ worth of space suddenly became available. Or imagine how much revenue the city could generate if it charged anything close to market rate for each of the 2.94 million parking spaces that make up this approximately 500 million square feet of public space.

Free parking in New York City and the problems it causes is currently having a moment. After years of withering attacks by Donald Shoup, a UCLA urban planning professor who has made the fight against parking his life’s calling, a Manhattan community board has now picked up the thread. Community Board 7’s transportation committee passed a resolution earlier this year calling for an end to on-street parking in its district, though the board has since walked that proposal back slightly.

But the board has a point: The costs of free parking—cars sitting idle for days on end, essentially converting what should be public space into free private storage, or adding to traffic and pollution as drivers circle endlessly for their subsidized 180 square feet of street space—have become abundantly clear. And with congestion pricing rolling out in a year, some New Yorkers want to reclaim all of this space, while some others want to price it accordingly.

In its examination of the issue, the New York Times asked, “Could New York City Eliminate Free Street Parking?” The answer is yes: There’s never been a better time to end, once and for all, this massive giveaway of hundreds of millions of square feet of our city to drivers.

First, some numbers. Based upon well-established research, New York City has approximately 3 million on-street parking spaces, and of those, more than 95 percent are free. (The rest are available for a nominal fee during business hours only.) And this massive giveaway benefits a minority of city households: According to Census data, of New York City’s 3.1 million households, approximately 55 percent are car-free. In Manhattan, currently the subject of the fiercest debates over street space, a whopping 76.6 percent of households are car-free.

Meanwhile, as with the arguments I made here on Curbed last year in favor of congestion pricing, charging for parking largely affects those who are well-off. Overall, New York City’s car-owning households have a median income of $85,000, well above the city’s median household income of $55,000 and more than double the $40,000 median income of car-free households.

In Manhattan, where the borough-wide median income is $75,000, car-owning households report a median income of $134,000, while car-free households have a median income of $69,000. Simply put, free street parking is a giveaway to people who don’t need special perks and is a poor use of public space in a city where space is at a premium.

The negative effects of free parking on cities have also long been established. As Shoup has explored in a variety of books, free parking amounts to a nationwide subsidy on par with American defense spending. Because city residents expect free parking and car owners tend to ignore the negative externalities and costs of driving, free parking incentivizes driving when other means of faster, cleaner, and often more reliable transit are readily available. Traffic and pollution increase; congestion and the economic waste brought on by stopped traffic increase; and fatalities and pedestrian injuries increase as the number vehicle miles increases. Space that could be otherwise used for people or used to capture revenue is reserved to reward behavior harmful to urban life and urban residents.

Then there’s the fact that on-street parking wasn’t always free or even legal in New York City. For decades, cars weren’t permitted to park overnight on city streets; it wasn’t until the 1950s, when the Department of Sanitation wanted to clean streets during the day, that the city chose to make a bad deal for itself and a good one for drivers. In exchange for free overnight parking, drivers would agree to move their cars every few days to accommodate street sweepers. Thus began the disastrous practice of giving away street space, and creating a wasteful system in which drivers or simply run their engines for the sake of it so street cleaners can get by.

Charging for parking—whether through a massive expansion of metered space, a residential permit program, or both—rationalizes a system of transportation that currently encourages driving. As Shoup has detailed, charging for parking helps free up spaces by reducing demand, and drivers spend less time circling for spots and more time out of their cars, interacting with the city. In New York, where so many cars are registered out of state, a permit program could capture car registration fees lost to lax enforcement while allowing the city to realize revenue from underpriced public space. (Those hundreds of millions of square feet of sure could fund a lot of park improvement plans.)

Removing parking, of course, creates a political firestorm, and the Times article features its fair share of drivers complaining about the loss of a few thousand parking spots over the past few years, as the city has tried to keep pedestrians safe and make cycling safer. But in the age of climate change and of enlightened thinking about the allocation of street space, it’s time to end the free parking giveaway. The city can start to capture the billions of dollars in currently gives away as subsidies to drivers, reduce congestion, and reallocate new revenue to transit development in underserved areas. The end of car culture is coming and the city’s politicians should pick up the cause of Community Board 7 as it fights the good fight against free parking.

https://www.ttnews.com/articles/new-york-city-congestion-pricing-hits-speed-bump-over-who-gets-exemptions,New York,New York City Congestion Pricing Hits Speed Bump Over Who Gets Exemptions,"New York lawmakers facing an April 1 deadline to approve a state budget have agreed to impose tolls upon motorists who enter midtown Manhattan, but they still must decide on politically fraught issues over who gets to be exempt.

Individuals with “an identifiable hardship or limited ability to access medical facilities” shouldn’t have to pay, Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio said last month. Commuters already paying tolls on bridges or tunnels entering Manhattan south of 61st Street also should get a break, they said. But lawmakers must define hardship and determine which toll-payers get the offset.

These policy decisions are among the most difficult for politicians, said Bruce Schaller, an international transportation consultant who first envisioned a congestion pricing program in 2007 as the city Transportation Department’s deputy commissioner for traffic and planning. If the goal is to reduce traffic and produce maximum revenue for mass transit, no motorist should get a discount or credit merely for paying bridge tolls on the way into the city, he says.

“The only reason to give someone an exemption is that they have to go into Manhattan and can’t use public transportation,” Schaller said. “The premise is to raise revenue and to encourage the use of transit.”

Exempting disabled motorists might appear as a simple matter, yet Albany lawmakers continued to negotiate March 29, trying to compromise on language defining who would be covered.

“A congestion-pricing scheme must exempt drivers who have accessible parking placards,” Ericka Jones, an advocate the Center for Disability Rights, told lawmakers at a budget hearing last month.

Politicians tend to be overly broad in granting such favors to voters, said Matthew Daus, a New York-based national transportation consultant and former chairman of the city Taxi and Limousine Commission.

“The congestion-pricing plan should include carve-outs for people with disabilities, but where you draw the line can be a daunting challenge,” Daus said. Setting the criteria too broadly and subjectively “could result in a sizable exemption group, which could undercut the revenue benefits.”

As for commuters by car, the governor has grown impatient with suburban lawmakers complaining about congestion fees imposed on those already paying bridge and tunnel tolls to enter the city, yet he needs their votes to make congestion pricing a reality.

Congestion pricing is the solution we need to deliver New Yorkers the mass transit they deserve and reduce NYC's traffic. Add your name:https://t.co/XqGoNanMh0 — Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) March 27, 2019

“Carve out the bridge my constituents use, said the assembly and senators,” Cuomo said this week during a WNYC radio interview. “Yeah, but you carve this out, it’s a smaller pie.” The larger the pie, the more likely it is that the program would reach the $1 billion revenue goal, enough to pay debt service on $15 billion — a start toward fixing deteriorating service on city subways and buses, and regional commuter trains.

If motorists on some bridges and tunnels get breaks entering Manhattan while others don’t, it runs the risk of clogging traffic at the exempted crossings, Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie said.

“You will end up causing a congestion nightmare because everybody will be wanting to go the free way,” Heastie said. “It’s not just about double fees and congestion tolling; it’s also how you avoid causing huge traffic nightmares.”

In the final analysis, Heastie said, congestion-pricing policies have to balance the need for revenue to maintain a transit system vital to the region’s economy with traditional notions of fairness.

“When you start saying you don’t want to double-toll,” Heastie said, “you start to minimize the receipts,” and that could force lawmakers to impose higher tolls, he continued, as he described the lawmakers’ dilemma with reporters this week. “We’re just trying to fix these things.”",['Subsistence - Mobility']

But Bloomberg also boasted in his speech at the Christian Cultural Center, a black megachurch in Brooklyn, N.Y., about his record on crime and criminal justice.

""In fact, no other city in America did what we did,"" the billionaire former Republican and former independent claimed. ""We reduced murders by 50%, reduced police shootings to historic lows, reduced the number of people incarcerated by nearly 40%.""

Bloomberg also made the murder and incarceration claims on his campaign website, and he repeated them on Twitter on the day he announced.

Statistics back Bloomberg, but he goes too far in claiming credit.

Bloomberg’s tenure

In 1981, long before he became the latest presidential candidate in a crowded Democratic field, Bloomberg co-founded Bloomberg LP, a financial information and media company. He is now the eighth-wealthiest American, with a net worth of $54 billion, according to Forbes.

Bloomberg succeeded Rudy Giuliani as mayor in 2002 and served until 2013. He was succeeded by the current mayor, Bill de Blasio, who briefly ran for the Democratic presidential nomination before dropping out in September.

In 2013, near the end of his tenure, Bloomberg claimed that New York was the nation’s safest big city. Our rating, looking at violent crimes plus property crimes, was Mostly True.

Now let’s dig into each of the four parts of his current claim.

‘Reduced murders by 50%’

Bloomberg’s campaign cited data showing there were 649 murders in 2001, the year before Bloomberg took office, and 335 in 2013, his final year in office. That’s a reduction of roughly half.

But murders started declining a decade before Bloomberg took office and continued downward after he left.

Murders dropped ""precipitously"" during the 1990s — from roughly 2,200 at the start of the decade, noted Ames Grawert of the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law.

Graphic from the New York City Mayor's Office of Criminal Justice

""Was the slope any steeper during Bloomberg than in the preceding decade? Not at all,"" said Jeffrey Fagan, a professor of law and a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University.

‘Reduced police shootings to historic lows’

In 2013, the total number of shots fired by officers — 248 — and total shooting incidents — 81 — were the lowest since the New York Police Department began keeping such records in 1971, according to the department’s 2013 annual firearms discharge report, which Bloomberg’s campaign cited. Police shot and killed eight people and injured 17 others that year, the report says.

But here, too, Bloomberg appears to be going too far by taking credit: The trend downward started before Bloomberg took office. And while shooting incidents hit the record low of 81 in 2013, they had risen to 105 a year earlier, during his tenure.

""The fact that reductions have continued under de Blasio shows that the declines are being driven by factors other than the municipal genius of mayoral-led policing and prosecutorial strategies,"" said Eugene O’Donnell, a lecturer at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City.

‘Reduced number of people incarcerated by nearly 40%’

In 2001, the year before Bloomberg took office, New York City had 703 jailed or imprisoned inmates for every 100,000 residents, according to the mayor’s Office of Criminal Justice. In 2013, it was 429 — a drop of 39%.

The same chart shows, however, that the decline began years before Bloomberg took office and has continued for years afterward, the figure was 910 in 1996 before dropping to the 703 in 2001, a decline of 23% in five years. And there’s another issue.

""The criminal prosecution/punishment decisions are not those of the mayor or his administration,"" said Franklin Zimring, a University of California, Berkeley, School of Law faculty director of criminal justice studies and author of the 2012 book, ""The City That Became Safe: New York’s Lessons for Urban Crime and Its Control.""

‘No other city in America did what we did’

Bloomberg’s campaign says no other city has achieved the three reductions Bloomberg touted. There is truth to that.

""New York City is in a class by itself in the country on public safety — serious crime has dropped for decades,"" O’Donnell told us.

But comparisons are dicey.

The FBI is one of the strongest voices warning that city-to-city comparisons are invalid. Among other things, the FBI points out that no two cities are alike and the rates at which crimes are reported vary among cities.

Our ruling

Bloomberg said, ""No other city in America did what we did. We reduced murders by 50%, reduced police shootings to historic lows, reduced the number of people incarcerated by nearly 40%.""

He’s generally on target, as each of the three statistical claims are backed by the numbers. But Bloomberg can’t claim all the credit, in that the declines began before he took office and continued afterward; and experts including the FBI warn against using statistics to make city-to-city comparisons.

For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.",['Protection - Security']
https://newyork.cbslocal.com/2019/12/29/nyc-murders-hate-crimes-2019/,New York,"Safest Big City? Mayor And NYPD Say Crime Is Down — But Murders, Shootings, Hate Crimes All Rose In 2019","NEW YORK (CBSNewYork/AP) – For several years, New York has prided itself as being the safest big city in America.

The NYPD and Mayor de Blasio have boasted about a continued drop in crime citywide, sending numbers to historic lows.

As CBS2 has been reporting on since March however, a closer look at those numbers finds several unnerving trends being masked by the overall lower crime rate.

In one of the NYPD’s final weekly CompStat reports for the year, several major crimes have increased when compared to the same point in 2018.

As of Dec. 22, murders, robberies, felony assaults, shootings, sex crimes, and hate crimes are all on the rise throughout the five boroughs.

See The Full Report Here

The city has tallied 311 homicides, compared with 290 at the same point last year – an increase of 7.2 percent according to CompStat.

It’s the second straight year of increases after the city achieved a modern-era low of 292 homicides in 2017, but authorities argue this year’s total is skewed in part by an outsized number of deaths carried over from years past.

At least 27 deaths in this year’s statistics happened prior to 2019 but weren’t classified as homicides by the city’s medical examiner until this year, the NYPD said. They must be counted in the statistics for the year the death certificate is issued.

This of course will also be the case for a currently unknown number of 2019 murders, which won’t end up being counted until 2020 or later.

The Dec. 22 report shows, overall, crime among the seven major felony categories has fallen by 1.16 percent in 2019. A deeper dive into that finds that decrease is almost entirely due to a drop in burglaries.

Without the burglary stats, major crime has only fallen by a microscopic 0.05 percent compared to 2018.

Shootings, “Uniform Crime Reporting” rapes, and “other sex crimes” are all not included in the major crime categories – but all have seen a rise this year.

FLASHBACK: NYPD Changing How It Records Sex Crimes, Adds More Assaults To What Constitutes Rape

Police sources tell CBS2 the city’s year-long eruption in hate crimes has also not slowed down. Through Dec. 22, hate crimes have skyrocketed by 16 percent.

Of the 406 reported incidents, more than half of those complaints were for anti-Semitic attacks. That number does not even account for this week’s rash of incidents targeting the Jewish community.

There have been at least nine such attacks in the days following the NYPD’s report.

As New York City moves into 2020, law enforcement officials are already bracing for even more bad news — as New York State’s bail reform laws are poised to release scores of suspects from jail and back onto city streets starting Jan. 1.

“It’s concerning. We’re going to have to work harder than ever with our partners, with our fellow district attorneys, to prosecute these crimes to make sure that we are on top of our game,” new NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea told CBS2 earlier this month.

The commissioner said he’s most worried about repeat offenders, who judges will be prevented from imposing a cash bail on regardless of their criminal history.

“When you have individuals that are standing before a judge and immediately being released, and essentially everyone in the room knows that this person is a danger to the community, I think we need to look at the system and make sure that judges can make common sense decisions.” Shea explained.

“Having dangerousness is at the crux, in my opinion, of what we would like to see changed with some of these laws.”

This is the list of crimes for which judges MUST RELEASE defendants come Jan 1.

According to the Police Benevolent Association, suspects arrested for burglary, arson, grand larceny, various hate crimes, and several other offenses will all be released without bail — and given free incentives to return for a later court date.

https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-10-29/extreme-red-flag-winds-hitting-la-region-dangerous-historic,Los Angeles,Why the ‘extreme red flag’ winds hitting L.A. region are especially dangerous,"Even after several years of devastating wind-driven fires in Southern California, forecasters fear that the next two days could bring new levels of danger.

“Extreme” fire weather began in the Los Angeles area at 11 p.m. Tuesday and was expected to persist for 30 hours, bringing isolated gusts of up to 80 mph. It’s an unusually long Santa Ana wind condition, and fire weather of this kind hasn’t been seen in Southern California since October 2007, when similar conditions helped unleash the sixth most destructive fire in California history.

The National Weather Service office in Oxnard took the unusual step of labeling the fire weather conditions an “extreme red flag” warning, a term that meteorologists there say they can’t remember ever using. But they did so to underscore the severity of this Santa Ana wind event.

“This is the worst since we had an event in October 2007,” said National Weather Service meteorologist Tom Fisher. “Don’t let your guard down.”

“It’s going to be stronger than most Santa Ana conditions, in terms of the raw wind speed, and the long duration of the winds,” and the particularly dry air, said weather service meteorologist Joe Sirard.

“It’s kind of like when your skin starts to crack open — it’s going to be that kind of dryness,” Sirard said. “Very, very dry air coming in.”

Here is what we know:

The forecast

Dangerous winds are forecast to blow so hard that there’s a threat of downed power lines. Mountains could see gusts of up to 80 mph; valley passes, canyons and coastal areas between the Hollywood Hills to Malibu and the Ventura County coasts could see gusts of up to 60 mph.

The wind speeds from the extreme red flag warning event that started Tuesday at 11 p.m. and was to last through Thursday at 6 p.m. could produce damaging sustained winds of 50 mph to 70 mph across most of L.A. and Ventura counties, with isolated gusts of 80 mph; the air moisture will be dangerously dry, with relative humidities falling to perhaps 1% or 2%; a humidity of 15% to 20% is already quite dry.

Red flag warnings will be in effect starting either Tuesday night or Wednesday morning in Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino and San Diego counties.

“This all adds up to an extreme fire weather threat, meaning that conditions are as dangerous for fire growth and behavior as we have seen in recent memory,” the weather service in Oxnard said.

Exceptionally dangerous conditions

Red flag warnings — a term to warn of high fire weather danger — are already supposed to spark alarm bells for the general public. But this one is on the higher end of any similar period of fire weather in the past dozen years.

In October 2007, a series of fires broke out across Southern California, burning more than 198,000 acres, destroying 1,500 homes, injuring 40 firefighters and causing two deaths. The most significant of those fires was the Witch fire in San Diego County, which destroyed more than 1,000 homes and ultimately caused the region’s major utility to launch a $1.5-billion effort to harden its grid that is still going on.

“It’s not a routine red flag warning event. It’s on the high end of the scale, in terms of weather significance,” said Sirard. “We want to emphasize the exceptional danger of this type of event.”

The wind speeds could be comparable, or even stronger, than the Santa Ana winds that whipped the Thomas fire to grow at a breathtakingly fast pace in December 2017 in Ventura County and eventually burn into Santa Barbara County.

Strong winds slapped together two Southern California Edison power lines together that month, igniting the Thomas fire, which killed two, destroyed more than 1,000 structures and burned more than 280,000 acres. That fire is California’s 10th most destructive in the modern record.

What’s causing the extreme conditions

The Santa Ana winds of Southern California come from the northeast and blow southwest, fueled by high-pressure air over Nevada and Utah seeking a path through mountain slopes and canyons to fill lower-pressure voids on the coast. Not only is dry desert air blowing into California, but as the air descends in elevation it warms, and the relative humidity plummets.

One tool forecasters use to predict Santa Ana winds is to measure the difference in pressure between Los Angeles International Airport and the community of Daggett in the San Bernardino County desert. The record for October — which sees particularly flammable vegetation if autumn rains haven’t yet arrived — is negative 10.2 millibars, which occurred on Oct. 21 and Oct. 22, 2007. On Oct. 21, 2007, San Diego Gas & Electric’s downed power line started the Witch fire, burning nearly 200,000 acres.

The forecast for this extreme red flag event is negative 10 millibars. That’s why forecasters are so concerned this event may be extreme.

The monster Santa Ana event is being fueled in part by intensely cold high pressure over the Rocky Mountains.

“There’s actually record cold air mass right now over the Rockies and the Great Basin,” said Daniel Swain, climate scientist with UCLA and the National Center for Atmospheric Research. In Boulder, Colo., there’s a foot of snow on the ground and the temperature is 9 degrees — in October.

“This extremely cold air mass directly from the Arctic is sitting just to the east of California. And that is obviously a great contrast with the not-so-frigid air over California, and especially as you get closer to the ocean,” Swain said. “That thermal contrast is setting up that strong pressure contrast, which is in turn driving these very strong winds.”

While temperatures along the California coast are close to average for this time of year, they’re well below average to the state’s east — an extreme difference that’s driving the winds, Swain said.

The air mass “dropped straight down southward out of the Arctic over the Rockies because there’s such a big mass of high pressure over Alaska right now, where they have been experiencing record warmth on a recurring basis, and where there is effectively no sea ice on the Arctic Ocean coast for the first time in recorded history in October.”

The warm mass of air over Alaska, as a result, has had the effect of placing “a big blob of cold air over the Rockies, which is creating this extreme contrast that’s generating the winds in California,” Swain said.

Strong winds in unlikely places

A danger for Southern California is that places that don’t often see strong winds could see them. Parts of the San Fernando Valley could see gusts of 70 mph to 80 mph.

“The magnitude of the wind gusts really are going to be a concern,” Swain said. “The actual winds that people experience really will be quite extreme in a lot of places, really everywhere except for the wind-sheltered parts of downtown L.A. and central L.A.”

Swain said this Santa Ana event won’t be as long as the Thomas fire’s in 2017, which lasted for days. But it will feel long, considering how extreme the winds will be, Swain said. “It’s not going to be a quick, six-hour-over-and-done sort of thing. It’s going to be at least a 24-, 36-hour duration of extremely strong winds in a lot of places.”

Northern California also hit

The National Weather Service office in Monterey, which covers the Bay Area, forecast a “historic” and “extreme” Diablo wind event for this past weekend, and their forecast was right. Strong winds aided the rapid spread of the Kincade fire in Sonoma County over the weekend, where a gust of 96 mph was recorded in the Mayacamas Mountains northeast of Healdsburg. Firefighters fought rapidly growing fires on both sides of the Carquinez Bridge and in the cities of Lafayette and Martinez in the East Bay.

Large swaths of Northern California are also under a red flag warning that began Tuesday and will last through Wednesday. Dry, gusty Diablo winds from the northeast won’t be as strong as they were over the weekend, but they could still hit 65 mph in the North Bay mountains; in the East Bay mountains, 50 mph; and in the Santa Cruz Mountains and the peninsula south of San Francisco, 40 mph.

Using the word ‘extreme’

The National Weather Service has begun to use the word “extreme” to characterize other potentially catastrophic weather events differently, such as for flash flood warnings and tornado warnings, Swain said.

“In places where both of those are common, like the Deep South for floods and ‘Tornado Alley’ in the Midwest for tornadoes, people started to dismiss regular old tornado warnings and regular old flash flood warnings,” Swain said. “So they started to issue a ‘flash flood emergency,’ or ‘particularly dangerous situation’ tornado warnings, sort of as a signifer that this was no ordinary flood, or no ordinary tornado.

“It sounds like we’re starting to use the same kind of language now for fire weather warnings in California,” Swain said.",['Protection - Security']

https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jun/04/los-angeles-homeless-population-city-county,Los Angeles,"Los Angeles homeless population hits 36,000 in dramatic rise","Los Angeles has experienced a 16% increase in the homeless population over the last year, the latest sign of severe income inequality and a worsening housing crisis plaguing California.

There are now more than 36,000 homeless people in the city of LA, and nearly 59,000 across LA county, a 16% and 12% uptick respectively, according to an annual LA county report released on Tuesday.

The county “point-in-time count”, conducted by thousands of volunteers in January each year, is an estimate of the number of people living on the street, in tents, in cars and in shelters. The sharp increases paint a picture of a growing public health crisis in a region home to some of the richest neighborhoods and people in the US. Some key data from the report:

More than 44,000 (75%) of the homeless population are unsheltered, with more than 16,000 people living in cars and more than 11,000 in tents and makeshift shelters.

The number of homeless families increased by 8% to 8,800, with more than 1,600 of them unsheltered.

Youth homelessness also increased by 24% to nearly 4,000, and more than half of young people are unsheltered.

More than half of unsheltered adults are experiencing homelessness for the first time.

The LA mayor, Eric Garcetti, called the increase “heartbreaking” in a statement. “These results remind us of a difficult truth: skyrocketing rents statewide and federal disinvestment in affordable housing, combined with an epidemic of untreated trauma and mental illness, is pushing people into homelessness faster than they can be lifted out,” he said.

The report found that 53% of people suffering homelessness for the first time cited “economic hardship” as a leading factor, and that roughly one-quarter of the unsheltered adults lost their housing in 2018. A majority of the homeless people have also lived in the county for more than 10 years.

“I’ve been crying out that this is a disaster of epic proportions,” said the Rev Andy Bales, CEO of Union Rescue Mission, an LA homeless organization. “Thousands upon thousands are suffering in the streets … and the longer you leave people on the streets, the more devastating it is.”

The crisis has disproportionately hit black Americans, who are four times more likely to experience homelessness in LA than other groups; they represent 33% of the homeless population despite representing only 8% of the county population.

Officials in LA county, which spent $619m on the crisis last year, said they had made progress in 2018, placing more than 21,000 people in homes, an increase of 23% from the previous year.

The Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority (Lahsa) also noted that the exorbitant rent increases in the area combined with stagnant wages means one-third of households now spend more than 50% of income on rent. One recent study named LA the least-affordable housing market in the country.

An LA renter earning minimum wage would need to work 79 hours a week to afford a one-bedroom apartment, and the county would need more than 500,000 new affordable units to meet the needs of low-income renters.

“The pressures on Angelenos are severe,” Peter Lynn, Lahsa executive director, said at a public meeting unveiling the numbers, adding that the government “can help thousands of people exit homelessness, even as thousands more fall into homeless”.

Bales said his own employees could not afford to live in LA and that the crisis was “past the tipping point”, adding: “I hope this is the wake-up call.”

The data was released days after the Wall Street Journal reported that developers in LA have built a surplus of lavish mansions in posh LA neighborhoods – with price tags in the tens and hundreds of millions.

“The unaffordability in this city is sending more and more people on to the streets,” said Tracy Jeanne Rosenthal, co-founder of the LA Tenants Union. “What is going on is out of control rent-gouging, real estate speculation, the destruction of rent-controlled housing, and the overdevelopment of luxury [housing],” she added.

Rosenthal said she was tired of seeing the homeless criminalized and harassed by police, and that public housing and expanded rent control policies were critical to allowing people to stay in their homes and in LA.

Once people are evicted or pushed out due to huge rent hikes, they often have no other options for housing, she added: “If you’re evicted in Los Angeles, you’re evicted from Los Angeles. If you want to remain housed, you have to leave the city completely.”",['Subsistence - Living Space']
https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-los-angeles-fur-ban-20190212-story.html,Los Angeles,L.A. will become biggest city in the U.S. to ban fur sales,"Los Angeles will become the biggest city in the United States to ban the sale of animal fur, under a new law backed Tuesday by the City Council.

The new ordinance, which will go into effect in 2021, makes it illegal to sell, manufacture or trade furs or fur clothing and accessories such as coats, handbags and key chains in L.A. city limits.

The ban includes a number of exemptions: Used furs can still be sold at secondhand shops. People can still sell or trade the pelts of dead animals preserved through taxidermy. And the city will not prohibit fur produced from animals taken lawfully under a trapping license.

Animal rights activists hailed the decision, denouncing the fur business as barbaric and unnecessary. “Animals are not fabric — they are sentient beings who suffer terribly,” said Patty Shenker, a member of Animal Defenders International. “And we must include them in our moral compass.”

Fur sellers and manufacturers, in turn, said their industry was being unfairly singled out and smeared, and warned that legal action could be next.

Because the Tuesday vote was not unanimous, the proposed law will come back to the council for a second, procedural vote before going to Mayor Eric Garcetti for his signature. The sole councilman to oppose the new law was Greig Smith, who was recently appointed to fill the seat vacated by Councilman Mitchell Englander.

At a committee meeting last week, Smith said he was deeply concerned about abruptly shutting down “legitimate businesses,” calling it “not American,” and noted that the city had not estimated the economic impact. His spokesman, Colin Sweeney, later said that Smith “thinks controlling the industry with regulations to minimize harm … is preferable to a ban.”

“Prohibition inevitably leads to black markets where abuses are often worse than they were in the first place,” Sweeney said in a statement.

Councilman Bob Blumenfield, who championed the ban, called the fur industry “egregious in its cruelty” and said that although he believes the ban will not hurt the L.A. fashion industry, no economic analysis would have changed their decision on a “philosophical issue.”

“End this outdated and deplorable practice,” Blumenfield urged the rest of the council before the vote. “The time is long overdue.”

Another backer of the ban, Councilman Paul Koretz, declared at a meeting last year that “animal cruelty is animal cruelty, and if we lose a few jobs, that’s life.”

L.A. is following West Hollywood, Berkeley and San Francisco, which have passed similar bans. When it was adopted in West Hollywood, the move was seen as largely symbolic because shoppers could easily head to neighboring Los Angeles or Beverly Hills for fur.

Activists say the L.A. ban is important not only for its geographic reach, but to encourage more cities and possibly the whole state to follow.

“Los Angeles has the opportunity to make a clear statement to the rest of the world that the confinement, torture and brutal killing for fur will not be tolerated,” Chatsworth resident Katie James and other supporters wrote in letters urging council members to pass the ban.

Opponents argued that the city was kowtowing to animal rights extremists and depriving consumers of the freedom to decide for themselves. Last year, a Gallup poll found that 60% of respondents deemed it “morally acceptable” to buy and wear clothing made of animal fur.

“We do not bully people or coerce them or force them to buy fur,” said Donna Pappas, owner of Somper Furs. “It’s our opponents who bully people.”

Pappas grew teary at one meeting at City Hall after pleading with officials to grandfather in existing businesses or give them more time before the law goes into effect. Fur industry groups had also pushed unsuccessfully for L.A. to hold off on the ban in favor of a certification program that they said would provide assurance that animals were treated humanely.

“The sad part is there’s been no effort by the city council to educate themselves as to what the reality is,” said Ryan Holt, chairman of the trade group Fur Industries of North America.

Much of the uproar has revolved around gruesome videos circulated by animal rights activists, some of which has been replayed at City Hall. Lesley McCave, communications director for Animal Defenders International, said that undercover videos and investigations had exposed nightmarish cruelty, including anal electrocution of animals, as well as cramped and filthy conditions.

Fur industry groups have disputed the accuracy of such videos. In one of those cases, the International Fur Federation obtained testimony from men in China saying that they had been paid to skin an animal alive on video and that it was not “common practice,” according to affidavits provided by industry representatives.

Blumenfield said that such videos were not crucial to the Tuesday decision.

“There’s so much evidence of the cruelty ... that we didn’t need a few videos to make that point,” he told reporters.

https://www.foxnews.com/us/la-city-council-moratorium-evictions-statewide-rental-rules,Los Angeles,"Los Angeles City Council halts 'no-fault' evictions ahead of statewide rental controls, reports say","The Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday approved a moratorium on evictions in a bid to prevent landlords from kicking out tenants ahead of statewide rental controls, according to reports.

The ban, which council members passed in a 14-to-0 vote, would prevent property owners from evicting tenants without ""just cause,"" the Los Angeles Times reported.

""Just cause"" would include non-payment of rent or using the unit for criminal activity.

Tenants' rights groups cited by The Times said ""no-fault evictions"" have increased since Gov. Gavin Newsom signed Assembly Bill 1482 into law earlier this month. The law has limited rent increases to 5 percent plus inflation, in most cases.

A ""no-fault eviction"" refers to when tenants are evicted for no fault of their own, such as when a landlord abruptly ends the lease, KABC reported.

AS HOUSING COSTS RISE, SOME PEOPLE ARE CHOOSING TO LIVE ON THE ROAD INSTEAD

California is set to implement new restrictions on evictions and rent increases on January 1, 2020.

Housing advocates cited by the station said landlords have been issuing more eviction notices and raising rents by unreasonable amounts since Newsome signed the new law.

The mayor’s response has been to increase public spending on homelessness sharply, but he’s had frustratingly little to show for it. When the homelessness issue burst onto front pages a few years ago, Garcetti jumped into action with an ambitious plan to build emergency shelters in all 15 districts of the city. But as the mayor soon discovered, the issue with an “emergency” plan oriented around construction is that Los Angeles is a far cry from Bob Moses’s New York. Eighty percent of the shelters have been held up by red tape and community resistance. The short-term measures, then, must take the city’s built environment as a given.

A new sales tax boosted the city’s budget for dealing with homelessness to more than $600 million, or $20,000 per homeless person, while a bond issuance brought in $1.2 billion to go toward constructing an estimated 10,000 housing units over the next decade, all of which would be preserved for people transitioning off the street or in danger of ending up there. Los Angeles has taken about 16 percent of the funds from its recent sales-tax increase and packaged it as vouchers to offer to a share of its homeless population, allowing them to buy into the rental marketplace with the understanding that their subsidy will fade over the course of a year, shifting the burden onto the new renter.

While Los Angeles is right to want a program that moves people toward self-sufficiency—both for the sake of the homeless themselves and to protect the city’s coffers—the steep monthly increases as the vouchers fade out often outpace the low-wage, part-time work the recipients are able to find. Unsurprisingly, for an alarming share of recipients, the program is more of a one-year reprieve than the start of a new, stable life. Short of doing something serious about the underlying cost of housing in Los Angeles, a limited pool of voucher dollars will forever chase rising rents.

Before the city’s new homelessness count was released, the mayor had been touting the 20,000 people the city had moved off the street and into some form of housing. What we now know, however, is that while the Garcetti administration was helping to move 380 people off the street each week, some 480 others were joining the ranks of homeless Angelenos. Put another way, until someone does something about the city’s larger housing crisis, homelessness will be as much a part of the city’s landscape as Runyon Canyon.

https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-07-30/homeless-cars-la-law,Los Angeles,L.A. City Council votes to reimpose limits on living in vehicles,"Sleeping overnight in cars, vans and RVs will be prohibited again in many parts of Los Angeles, after the City Council voted Tuesday to reinstate rules that limit where people can live in their vehicles.

The decision extends the L.A. regulations, which had expired at the beginning of July, until January. Under the rules, people cannot spend the night in their cars on residential streets, or live in their vehicles at any time within a block of a park, school, preschool or day care facility.

At a hearing at City Hall, local activists argued that it was cruel and counterproductive to punish people for bunking down in vehicles while housing, shelters and “safe parking” programs for homeless people remain inadequate. Despite the impassioned pleas from opponents, the council voted 13-0, without any discussion, to reinstate the rules.

Immediately after the vote, opponents began shouting in disbelief and anger, bringing the council meeting to a halt. Many in the crowd started chanting, “Shame on you!”

As police detained one person in handcuffs and ushered other activists out of the room, Councilman Marqueece Harris-Dawson briefly spoke to reporters, calling the rules “an attempt to strike a balance.”

Letting people park and sleep anywhere at any time would be “totally unacceptable” for neighborhoods, Harris-Dawson said. For instance, the councilman said that RVs lined up around one park have blocked parking and stopped residents from using the park. In letters to the council, some Angelenos complained about trash and filth from cars-turned-homes.

“When you have 30,000 people living on the street, there are no good choices,” Harris-Dawson said.

More than 9,500 people live in cars, vans or RVs throughout the city of Los Angeles, according to the last annual count. But the scattering of safe parking sites now operating across the city have capacity for fewer than 200 vehicles nightly — a number expected to rise to more than 300 in the fall, according to the Los Angeles Homeless Services Authority.

Renewing the rules is “endorsing the continued harassment and criminalization of those who sleep in their cars when they have no safer place to go,” said Kate Corry-Saavedra, a member of the homeless advocacy group KTown for All.

Council members Bob Blumenfield and Mike Bonin were absent for the Tuesday vote. A spokesman for Mayor Eric Garcetti said the mayor plans to sign the measure, which is expected to go into effect by the end of the week.

The L.A. rules were first passed nearly three years ago to impose new regulations after a federal court struck down a citywide ban on living in vehicles, calling it an invitation to discriminate against the poor.

Those restrictions were initially meant to be a stopgap measure while the city got “safe parking” programs up and running. They permitted vehicle dwellers to stay the night in industrial or commercial districts, but kept them out of residential neighborhoods where Angelenos had complained about scarce parking, trash and other nuisances tied to RVs.

But in the years since, the City Council has clamped down on overnight parking in many additional areas, imposing such restrictions street by street.

Many of the bans have been targeted specifically at “oversize vehicles” such as RVs. In the meantime, safe parking programs have been slow to get started.

The result is a “de facto ban on living in vehicles at a time when nearly 10,000 Angelenos have literally no other housing option,” said Shayla Myers, an attorney with the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles.

At the Tuesday meeting, several people argued that vehicles provided shelter and safety to people who would otherwise be bedding down on the streets. Cue Jn-Marie, pastor of the Church Without Walls on skid row, said that “kicking people out of their car is a death sentence.”

Violating the vehicle dwelling rules is an infraction, punishable with a fine of up to $25 for the first offense, $50 for the second offense, and up to $75 for additional violations.

In a report last year, the Los Angeles Police Department said that 185 citations had been issued under the law between Feb. 6, 2017, and June 30, 2018 — approximately 10 citations a month.

In order to issue such a citation, police officers have to contact the person living in the vehicle and a violation can be “difficult to prove” when they cannot look inside because the person refuses to respond, the report said.

Despite those obstacles to enforcement, the lapse in the city rules had troubled some residents who argued that police needed the power to ticket RVs that park overnight in their neighborhoods. During that brief period, “vehicle dwelling everywhere was legal,” said Rob Wilcox, a spokesman for the city attorney.

“It has been a nightmare in Venice with people living in cars [and RVs] leaving trash and creating unsanitary conditions on our streets and sidewalks as well as taking away much needed parking,” Carol Katona wrote in a letter urging council members to reinstate the law. “Los Angeles will be a magnet for people from all over the country to come here and do the same. “

In his motion seeking to extend the restrictions for six months, Councilman Mitch O’Farrell said the city was still reviewing the rules and how they had been implemented and looking at ways to encourage communities to welcome safe parking programs.

The added time, he said in his motion, was needed to evaluate possible changes to the law.

https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-plastic-straws-20190301-story.html,Los Angeles,"L.A. approves new restrictions on disposable plastic straws, but stops short of a ban","Los Angeles restaurants will face new restrictions on handing out plastic straws under an ordinance approved Friday.

The City Council voted 12 to 0 for the new rules, which will go into effect for bigger businesses on Earth Day (April 22) and in October for all other restaurants, grocery stores and other food vendors. Councilman Mitch O’Farrell heralded the decision as an important step toward confronting a “major environmental calamity that is unfolding before us.”

“If we don’t act now, plastic in the ocean will outnumber fish” by 2050, he said.

Under the new ordinance, L.A. restaurants cannot offer or provide disposable plastic straws to customers who are dining in or taking food to go unless customers request them. The rules are slightly looser for drive-through or delivery: Businesses can go ahead and offer those customers plastic straws, but are still barred from giving them out without a request.

Advertisement

California has already passed similar rules on dine-in restaurants, but the Los Angeles “straws on request” law goes further because it also imposes restrictions on fast-food chains. Unlike San Francisco or Malibu, however, L.A. has not completely banned plastic straws — at least not yet.

In December, L.A. council members asked the Bureau of Sanitation to look into phasing out plastic straws entirely by 2021. O’Farrell has planned to press forward with a ban, saying last year that it is “one of those issues that we should’ve acted on probably 10 years ago.”

But that idea has raised concerns among disability rights advocates, who say that existing alternatives to plastic straws are not always practical or functional for people who need straws to drink. City staffers are preparing an analysis of how to ease the effects of a ban on people with disabilities, alongside the requested report on eliminating plastic straws.

Los Angeles County approved a similar ordinance restricting plastic straws in December and it applies to as many as 1,300 restaurants and food businesses in unincorporated areas. Under the county rules, restaurants must ask customers if they want a plastic straw before giving one out. In the city, it would be up to the customer to make the request in a dine-in restaurant.

Adena Tessler, a lobbyist representing the California Restaurant Assn., said at a recent council committee meeting that “our biggest issue at this point, for the restaurants, is a lack of consistency” among the state, city and county rules. O’Farrell replied that his hope was that restaurant chains would simply follow the “more comprehensive” L.A. rules in businesses across the county.

Plastic straws were the sixth-most collected item on California Coastal Cleanup days from 1988 to 2016, behind cigarettes, food packaging, caps and lids, plastic bags, and plastic utensils and dishes, according to a city report. Los Angeles has already banned plastic bags for groceries, which O’Farrell has credited for reducing bag waste in the L.A. River.

O’Farrell said that “although straws are a small part of the 8 million metric tons of plastic that end up in our ocean every year ... it is one thing that we can have really great control over.” Councilman Paul Krekorian added that the new ordinance “starts to change the national conversation about single-use plastics as a whole.”

https://edition.cnn.com/2019/06/18/politics/los-angeles-homeless-crisis/index.html,Los Angeles,"Los Angeles' homeless crisis: too many tents, too few beds","(CNN) In Los Angeles' Skid Row, tents line entire city blocks. These makeshift shelters for the city's homeless are now an almost permanent fixture of the city's landscape, with barbecue grills and clusters of bikes standing alongside them.

Some residents have tethered their tents to nearby fences and industrial buildings. Others run long power cords from their tents to nearby light poles to tap into the city's power grid. A few Skid Row pet owners have created small dog yards next to their tents under tarps to block out the sun and makeshift fencing. On a recent evening in this industrial part of LA's downtown, a young woman was washing her hair and her tank top in the jet of water gushing from a fire hydrant into the street.

As Los Angeles city and county officials struggle to shelter and build housing for nearly 60,000 people who are living on the streets, they are facing resistance -- not just to new structures in neighborhoods where residents fear more crime and blight, but also from some within the homeless community, who insist they would rather continue living independently on the streets in their tents.

While the homeless crisis is perhaps most visible in California, it is gripping so many other cities, including Washington, that many of the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates are beginning to face questions from voters about their plans. In 2018, about half of all Americans experiencing homelessness lived in one of five states -- California (24%), New York (17%), Florida (6%), Texas (5%) or Washington state (4%), according to the 2018 Annual Homeless Assessment Report , presented to Congress in December.

In dozens of interviews with unsheltered people in LA over the past year, many told CNN they won't apply for housing because they are afraid of the police, or unable to access the right documents to apply for ID, or sometimes simply wary of losing their independence if they are forced to live under rules that might be imposed if they moved into subsidized housing facilities.

Tents are now all over LA County. But the so-called ""shelter-resistant"" population is most evident in Skid Row, the portion of downtown where many of the city's homeless shelters, temporary housing and homeless services have traditionally been concentrated.

At the root of this tremendously complex problem is the fact that many within LA's unsheltered population are grappling with substance abuse addictions and untreated mental illness. Another major factor is that a series of lawsuits against the city -- aimed at preserving the rights of homeless people to protect their property -- has created a semipermanent tent culture in some sectors of LA.

Under city policy, tent-dwellers are required to take down their tents during daylight hours to clear the streets for pedestrians and business owners. But because of the lawsuits, that policy is not being uniformly enforced. In some areas it does not appear to be enforced at all.

The lawsuits and court injunctions against the city have had other unintended consequences. Because of the proliferation of tents, police say, it is much harder to identify and halt drug dealing and human trafficking. The legal battles have also complicated the city's ability to clear trash-strewn streets, because it is not easy to identify what bedding or clothing might belong to an unsheltered person living nearby.

Homeless women most vulnerable

The way in which tent culture feeds resistance to housing is one of the greatest frustrations for Los Angeles Police Officer Deon Joseph, who has worked in Skid Row for more than two decades both as a homeless advocate and enforcer.

During several nighttime patrols through Skid Row, he reeled off countless stories of unsheltered women who he has tried to get into the pipeline for housing, in part because they are among the most vulnerable to sexual assault, domestic violence and even demands for money from gang members who try to charge rent on certain blocks.

Several times a year, Joseph holds what he calls ""Ladies Night"" for the women of Skid Row -- a workshop where he brings in advocates to teach self-defense, how to report assault and rape, and legal rights.

He often cites the example of a 70-year-old woman named Lena living in Skid Row who he got to know well but who was resistant to housing: ""I tried to house her, tried to house her, tried to house her,"" Joseph said, ""and then one day I came back and someone found her dead in a pile of garbage. A human being found in garbage.""

Joseph notes that scores of well-meaning volunteers and church groups show up on Skid Row each month to try to help the population by providing food, clothing and even new tents. But in Joseph's view, that assistance often perpetuates the cycle of people living on the street.

""The shelters and the missions here, they give food and clothes to draw people in to get the services to that help people get on their feet -- like drug programs, alcohol programs, domestic violence program, job programs,"" Joseph said. ""But many of the folks from here won't use them, because they're getting their needs met on the streets of Skid Row.""

Rising homeless rate

As a result of several ballot measures approved by LA voters in the past few years, the city and the county spent hundreds of millions of dollars last year to address the homeless crisis. But the number of people living without shelter still went up 12% in the county and 16% in the city. Homelessness among youth and children rose 24% over the previous year, according to the 2019 Greater Los Angeles Homeless Count Results

Of the nearly 60,000 people who are homeless in LA County, 19% told officials they came to LA County from out of state, 15% said they arrived from another part of California and 1.2% said they came from outside the United States.

While the homeless count in Los Angeles was shocking, the rise in homelessness in neighboring counties was equally bracing. Homelessness was up 43% in Orange County over the previous year, 28% in Ventura County and 50% in Kern County.

When questioned about why they had fallen into homelessness, 53% of those who said they were homeless for the first time in LA County cited ""economic hardship""-- with the lack of affordable housing serving as a major driver for many.

The staggering homeless count rose despite the fact that LA's coordinated city-county homeless crisis response system helped 21,631 people move into permanent housing last year.

Another 31,500 people have been assessed by case managers and are waiting for housing or rental subsidies, according to city and county homeless officials. The county has opened eight new mental health urgent care centers and a sobering center to expand its outreach.

Housing for the homeless

While Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has confronted serious opposition in some neighborhoods even for his initial goal of placing 15 new shelters in City Council districts across the city, residents of some parts of Los Angeles County have been more receptive to housing for the homeless.

One example is the former Tiki Motel in LA County, a notorious site of neighborhood crime and blight that appeared in the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie ""The Terminator.""

Al Nunez, who grew up in East Los Angeles and was homeless for three years after his mother died of lung cancer, is one of the residents who now live at the converted Tiki Apartments.

Nunez was paralyzed by a gunshot wound to the spine 16 years ago. He often got sick during the time he was homeless, and would go days, he said, sleeping in his wheelchair.

""They would call me 'the statue,' "" he recalled in an interview. ""I was just alone because I was ashamed and embarrassed. Especially, where I was at -- it was my neighborhood where I grew up.""

Former friends and acquaintances would often pass him on the street: ""They wouldn't even acknowledge me or say anything to me. But I understand, it's because it's a stigma like -- 'You're homeless' -- It's like I wasn't the same person.""

""All I could think about is that I was going to either die from getting sick -- from being in my wheelchair -- or to the point where I wanted to take my own life because it was just a lot of suffering,"" he said. ""The only time I would go lay on a bed was when I would end up in the hospital. But ... once I was stable, it was like, 'You've got to go back on the street and fend for yourself.' ""

At another housing development called Mosaic Gardens at Willowbrook, in an unincorporated area of LA County, formerly homeless residents or those who were housed here because they were on the brink of homelessness have a playground, a computer lab and financial literacy programs, as well as access to services to help treat substance abuse or mental illness.

Suny Lay Chang, the chief operating officer of LINC Housing Corp., which built the project, notes that they involved the community in the design, from the paint colors to the city-in-the-country feel that they tried to create with a community garden and kitchen.

""We have groups come in to lead cooking classes and demonstration classes to help people learn how to eat healthy, cook healthy. We'll use some of the vegetables from the community garden to do that,"" Chang said. ""It's part of treating the whole individual.""

The project got off the ground, in part, because the community got behind it. One of the community leaders involved was Michael Torrence, a minister at nearby Fellowship Baptist Church who also directs a substance abuse prevention program for youth and families that is part of Volunteers of America of Greater Los Angeles.

Torrence said residents from the Willowbrook community were there ""from the planning to the first shovel to the cutting of the ribbons.""

""We feel a great sense of ownership,"" he said during an interview in the community kitchen of Mosaic Gardens at Willowbrook. ""I'm not a resident here, but as far as I'm concerned this is my place too.""

When asked about the resistance in other parts of Los Angeles to building homeless housing units and shelters, Torrence said he would argue that those neighborhoods will be safer if currently unsheltered people have ready access to wraparound services for substance abuse and mental health issues.

""Not in my backyard is only because you have a backyard right now,"" Torrence said. ""We have to recognize the fact that these are people.""

""If we address this, and provide housing and assistance and support -- then you can get past the whole notion of this is the other -- and begin to see them as my neighbor,"" he said.

""So, your backyard? If they're invested in it, they will take care of the backyard.""

A national political issue

When Los Angeles County released its shocking homeless count this month, Sen. Kamala Harris tweeted that housing is a ""human right,"" noting that her proposed LIFT Act -- to give lower-income working families a tax credit of up to $6,000 a year -- as well as her ""Rent Relief Act"" are intended to address the crisis.

The California Democrat and presidential candidate, addressing the Poor People's Campaign Forum in Washington on Monday, also introduced a new line in her campaign speech, saying, ""What we learn in that parable is that neighbor is that person you are walking by who is homeless on the street.""

Julian Castro recently toured storm tunnels beneath the Hard Rock Café in Las Vegas where hundreds of homeless individuals have sought shelter -- and on Monday he outlined his plan to ""end chronic homelessness by the end of 2028.""

""It wasn't lost on me or anyone else there that underneath hotels that are worth hundreds of millions of dollars,"" Castro said, ""you have people who are living in deep poverty, sleeping not even in the street but in a drainage tunnel.""

California voters approached both Joe Biden and Beto O'Rourke citing homelessness as a top concern during their respective visits to the Golden State. A voter in San Diego -- a city that erected enormous tent shelters last year to temporarily house hundreds of people -- told O'Rourke she was worried about the number of veterans living on the streets. The former Texas congressman noted that some of the homeless veterans he has spoken to in his home state had to wait so long for mental health treatment that they sought drugs on the street to treat their symptoms.

""If you cannot see a doctor and be well enough -- then there's a more likely chance that you're going to be homeless in the first place,"" O'Rourke told the voter during his San Diego town hall in late April. ""So starting with health care for everybody -- without exception, including mental health care -- is so fundamental to being able to get this done. And in California, perhaps especially, where housing prices are going through the roof, we've got to make sure that we are creating enough housing units for the demand that is here.""

Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont routinely highlights the growing number of homeless people nationwide as he rails against the fact that 40 million people are living in poverty while the ""very rich"" are ""getting richer."" ""Tonight some 500,000 Americans, including many veterans, will be sleeping out on the streets,"" Sanders said during a speech earlier this month at George Washington University.",['Subsistence - Living Space']
https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-08-15/city-workers-trash-bodily-fluids-los-angeles-civic-center,Los Angeles,"L.A. exposed city workers to trash, bodily fluids outside City Hall East, state says","The state agency that enforces workplace safety rules says employees of the city of Los Angeles were exposed to unsanitary conditions on the walkways outside City Hall East, according to two citations issued last week.

Inspectors with the Division of Occupational Safety and Health, or Cal/OSHA, found that workers at City Hall East were exposed to “trash and bodily fluids” on the exterior passageways. City Hall East is home to several city agencies, including City Atty. Mike Feuer’s office. Homeless people frequently sleep overnight on the sidewalks outside.

Cal/OSHA issued one citation to Feuer’s office and another to the city’s General Services Department, which oversees maintenance of city properties, assessing a combined $1,995 in penalties. Rob Wilcox, a Feuer spokesman, said the city would appeal both and noted that the city attorney’s office is not responsible for upkeep of the grounds outside City Hall East, which is across the street from City Hall.

“The tentative OSHA citation addresses conditions on the exterior grounds of City Hall East,” Wilcox wrote, referring to the citation sent to Feuer. “Our office clearly has no role in maintaining the building’s exterior grounds.”

Wilcox could not immediately provide the reasoning for the General Services Department to appeal its citation.

Cal/OSHA took action roughly eight months after a pest control company issued a report linking a rodent infestation at City Hall to several homeless camps in the immediate area. Maintenance officials never mentioned those findings during three City Council meetings called to discuss the rat problem.

The report, submitted by pest company Cats USA, identified unsanitary conditions in the Civic Center, such as leftover food, human waste and hypodermic needles.

The latest Cal/OSHA citations were issued in response to a complaint from Deputy City Atty. Elizabeth Greenwood, who said this year that while working at City Hall East she had contracted typhus, a flea-borne illness that can spread when fleas bite rats and then pass the bacteria on to humans.

Greenwood said she viewed Cal/OSHA’s actions as vindication, arguing that Feuer has repeatedly failed to take responsibility for how she contracted her illness. “They checked for fleas in the dead of winter, when fleas are dormant, and declared it was not their fault,” she said in an email.

Greenwood, who filed a $5-million legal claim against the city this year, said she is “grateful and relieved someone is going to force them to deal with this.”

Regulators examined City Hall East between Feb. 7 and Aug. 7, according to state records. The citations are only the latest to focus on the city’s maintenance practices.

In May, inspectors identified a rodent infestation and other unsanitary conditions at the Los Angeles Police Department’s Central Division station. The agency imposed fines of $5,425 on the LAPD and $1,910 on the Department of General Services.

Regulators said the LAPD did not have an effective program to exterminate and control rats, fleas, roaches, gnats and other insects within the building. The department also failed to train employees about how typhus is transmitted or how to properly clean dust, mold and other substances within its heating and air conditioning systems, the agency said.",[]
https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2019-10-08/e-cigarettes-vaping-devices-proposed-ban-los-angeles,Los Angeles,Los Angeles could ban all e-cigarettes and vaping devices,"Los Angeles officials are considering banning all e-cigarettes and vaping devices in the city, one of the most extreme proposals yet to curb a nationwide outbreak of lung illnesses linked to vaping.

Amid reports that more than 1,000 people have been diagnosed with severe lung problems, politicians across the country have been pushing restrictions on e-cigarettes, which have soared in popularity among young people in recent years.

San Francisco became the first city in the nation to ban e-cigarettes earlier this year. Massachusetts also recently instated a four-month ban on e-cigarettes, while Michigan and New York have outlawed flavored e-cigarette products.

L.A.'s proposal, introduced at Tuesday’s City Council meeting, would prohibit the sale of e-cigarette and vaping devices until they are deemed safe by the Food and Drug Administration. Because the FDA has approved almost no such devices, the law would essentially ban all of them.

“The reports of illness and death caused by unregulated vaping devices is a public health crisis,” reads the motion introduced by Councilman Paul Koretz. “Los Angeles is not content to wait and do nothing as the numbers of illnesses and even deaths associated with unregulated vaping devices increases daily.”

Koretz’s proposal was referred to a council committee focused on health, which would vet the idea before deciding whether to send it to the full council for a vote. If passed, city lawyers would draft an ordinance for council approval.

The lung illnesses have so far taken 18 lives nationwide and remain somewhat of a mystery, with health officials saying they are unsure what exactly is causing them. California health officials have advised people to stop vaping until the picture becomes more clear.

The outbreak has also prompted a wave of legislation that has caused a rift among public health experts. While some believe that e-cigarette restrictions will help prevent another generation from becoming addicted to nicotine, others worry they will take away options for adults trying to quit smoking.

Opponents point out that the majority of people who have become ill due to vaping had used products with THC, or tetrahydrocannabinol, mostly those acquired illegally. But most new bans are targeting nicotine delivered via e-cigarettes, which some experts believe can aid smokers who want to stop using cigarettes.

“No one in Los Angeles apparently wants to look uncool by bringing up very real dangers posed by illicit THC products,” said Gregory Conley, president of the advocacy group American Vaping Assn. “But unless they want these illnesses and deaths to continue to happen, someone has to do it.”

Health experts opposed to e-cigarette bans say they will drive former smokers back to cigarettes, which remain more dangerous, or will push them to buy nicotine products on the black market.

“What bans like this are likely to do is increase the use of illicit products and decrease regulation, which ironically will expand the use of the products that are causing folks to get sick,” said Leo Beletsky, a public health professor at Northeastern University.

Some officials have compromised by banning only flavored tobacco products, which are particularly appealing to young people and linked to the surge in high school use of e-cigarettes. A 2019 national survey by the University of Michigan found that 1 in 4 of the nation’s 12th-graders have used an e-cigarette in the last month — a trend that experts say threatens to reverse decades of success in lowering tobacco use among children.

“We really did get the rates down pretty low, and then this e-cigarette thing happened and it all kind of blew up again,” said Gael O’Sullivan, an expert in health marketing at the Georgetown University McDonough School of Business. “As unfortunate as these illnesses or deaths are, it’s a tipping point where it really is a public health emergency.”

Los Angeles County passed a ban last week that will outlaw flavored e-cigarettes as well as menthol cigarettes starting at the end of the month. The ban will apply to the 1 million people who live in unincorporated areas of the county.

The Trump administration has also proposed a ban on flavored e-cigarettes, and several states, including Ohio and Washington, are on their way to adopting similar laws. Los Angeles City Atty. Mike Feuer has also recommended a flavored tobacco ban.

Dr. Jessica Sims, with the American Heart Assn. said she welcomed Koretz’s move and stressed the importance of making flavored tobacco products less accessible to youth.

“Teens are using e-cigarettes at alarming rates and studies have shown that flavors play a most critical role in youth smoking initiation and continued use,” Sims said in an email. “Citywide bans are the best way to protect young people from easy access to these deadly products.”

Catherine Dizon, project director of the Tobacco Control Evaluation Center at UC Davis, said the lung illnesses have served as a catalyst for moving forward tobacco legislation, not just around e-cigarettes.

Manhattan Beach advanced a bill last week that would ban all tobacco products in the city, including cigarettes, which would make it the second city in the nation to do so after Beverly Hills.

https://www.latimes.com/business/real-estate/story/2019-12-27/l-a-rent-rose-65-percent-over-the-last-decade-study-shows,Los Angeles,"L.A. rent rose 65% over the last decade, study shows","On Wednesday, a sweeping rent control bill will take effect in California, capping yearly rent increases at 5% plus inflation and requiring just cause for eviction. But after the last decade for L.A. renters, the new protections appear akin to putting a Band-Aid on a bullet wound, according to a new study from listing service RentCafe.

The report — which synthesized data from PropertyShark, Yardi Matrix and the U.S. Census Bureau — found that the average rent in the city of Los Angeles has ballooned to $2,527, a whopping 65% increase since 2010. That’s significantly higher than the national average rent increase of 36% over the same period.

In Westwood, the average rent is nearly double that. The Westside neighborhood of UCLA students and young professionals has an average rent of $4,944 a month, The Times previously reported. That’s not only the highest rate in L.A. but also in all of California.

Family incomes have been unable to keep pace, the report also found. During the last 10 years, L.A.'s median household income grew 36% to $64,036. That’s slightly more than the national increase of 27% but far shy of the 61% jump San Francisco saw.

The findings arrive as renting continues to rise in popularity, with an increasing number of people renting by choice rather than necessity, according to the RentCafe report.

The 2010s saw the number of U.S. renters surpass 100 million for the first time, growing from 99.4 million in 2010 to 108.5 million in 2018. That means renters make up 34% of the U.S. population, up a full percentage point from a decade ago.

That number is nearly double in L.A., where renters make up 60% of the population. That ranks as the 19th-highest rate among the country’s 260 largest cities. Glendale boasts the state’s highest concentration of renters at 67%.

Over the course of the decade, 2.4 million apartment units were built in the U.S. to meet the rising demand, the study found. Roughly 98,000 of those were constructed in L.A., good for fifth-most in the country. A flurry of notable developments moved forward this year, including a controversial project that’s adding 725 units across five seven-story apartment buildings in Chinatown.

Other developers are taking advantage of a city program that allows for larger-than-usual projects near transit if developers ensure some units are affordable for people with lower incomes. On Venice Boulevard, one such builder is erecting an eight-story building with 79 units on a site zoned for 46 units by reserving eight for low-income households.

With land at a premium, however, apartments are becoming smaller. In 2010, new apartments covered an average of 990 square feet. Now, they average 933 square feet, according to the report. That’s a drop-off of 57 square feet — roughly the size of a small office or storage room.

The national average decrease is about 6%, but in Anaheim, new apartments shrank an average of 12%, which is the eighth-largest drop-off in the country.

The new rent control laws coming in 2020 will last for a decade and look to help out the roughly 9.5 million renters in California who spend more than 30% of their income on housing costs. In response, some landlords have considered more frequent rent increases, while others started handing out no-fault eviction notices to those who were paying low rent before the law forbids it next year, The Times previously reported.

https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/faa-changes-to-flight-pattern-over-mid-city-central-la/148945/,Los Angeles,"City of LA Suing FAA Over Changes to Flight Patterns Over Mid-City, Central LA","Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer said Monday that the city of Los Angeles is suing the Federal Aviation Administration due to changes in flight paths of planes flying into Los Angeles International Airport, specifically affecting the areas of Mid-City and central Los Angeles.

Feuer told NBCLA that he's received ""hundreds"" and ""thousands"" of complaints about the flight paths. The district attorney said that the goal should be to disperse the flights.

""No community should be particularly unduly burdened by a concentration of these flights,"" Feuer said.

The city will file the case in the U.S. Court of Appeals, challenging the FAA's recent changes to planes flying into LAX.

Feuer alleges that the FAA's changes were implemented ""without proper environmental review or public input"" and says the changes represent the latest ""failure to address noise and other negative impacts from aircraft overflights in those areas"" by the FAA.

The petition also challenges the FAA's recent decision to limit public comment, the statement said.

Said Feuer in a statement, ""The FAA made changes to a major flight path over Los Angeles without ever considering the environmental consequences of those actions. Then, the agency sought to curtail public comment on the FAA's own flight procedures website, including compelling members of the public to agree their input on the environmental impacts of proposed flight procedures won't count, as a condition of commenting on those procedures in the first place.

""Those decisions must not stand. We're fighting to give LA residents the chance to engage on a major issue affecting their quality of life, and, ideally, to create opportunities to find real solutions to noise and other concerns. And we're fighting for the American public's right to have their comments on FAA actions actually matter.""

LA Mayor Eric Garcetti backed Feuer's decision, ""Angelenos should be informed, heard, and presented with options for relief when flight path changes affect their communities. This did not happen when FAA implemented the new North Downwind Arrival flight path — and this lawsuit demands that the agency better engage the public and help protect our residents' quality of life.""

Los Angeles City Council President Herb Wesson added, ""Since May of 2017, we have been working with city, state and federal officials to mitigate the non-stop disruptions to our constituents created by the FAA's implementation of the NextGen Metroplex program. It's unfortunate that it has come to a lawsuit, but I will do everything in my power to protect my constituents and their quality of life.""

Three years ago, the FAA changed flight patterns for aircrafts landing at LAX, including consolidating flight patterns over West Adams and other communities in Mid-City and central LA, causing significant noise and other environmental impacts, according to the city attorney.

In May 2018, the FAA made further changes to the LAX flight arrival pattern but allegedly failed to perform the required environmental review or seek public comment, Feuer said.

Feuer is monitoring the FAA's actions with regard to the anticipated Environmental Assessment for Hollywood Burbank Airport, the arrival procedures for LAX, and in all other respects, the statement said.

The FAA does not comment on pending litigation. But a spokesperson told NBCLA that the agency is sensitive to noise concerns and said, ""In pursuing solutions, it is critical we don't solve one community's noise issue by moving it to another community.""",[]
https://www.fastcompany.com/90340978/los-angeles-just-announced-its-own-green-new-deal-to-drastically-slash-emissions,Los Angeles,Los Angeles just announced its own Green New Deal to drastically slash emissions,"While Congress talks about the Green New Deal, a version of it is already underway in L.A. The city may be known for its gridlock and smog, but it also has an ambitious plan to transform itself to tackle climate change. Today, the city announced how it’s accelerating its plans, moving to renewable energy, emissions-free buildings and vehicles, and reducing its water use—all while creating green jobs for its low-income communities.

“I don’t think there’s anything radical about creating a cleaner future for our grandchildren,” Mayor Eric Garcetti says on a call announcing the plan. “I hope that what we’re doing in LA will serve as a ‘greenprint’ for every city in the country and across the world. When we take a stand, it doesn’t matter that the president wants to boost fossil fuel production because most of America will already have been moving to a low carbon green energy world.”

100% renewable electricity

By 2025, L.A. plans to run on 55% renewable electricity and stop using coal power entirely. Instead of repairing three natural gas power plants along the coast, it will shut them down. By 2036, it will get to 80% renewables. By 2045, like the rest of California, it will run on 100% renewables. (The 2028 Olympics will also run on 100% clean power.) Community solar programs will help low-income households and renters get solar panels. The city’s deadlines for ramping up clean power have accelerated based on “an understanding of the severity of the threat and the pace at which we need to move, but also [an understanding] that the technology is there,” says Lauren Faber O’Connor, chief sustainability officer for the City of Los Angeles. “These opportunities to have a smarter, more flexible, and cleaner grid have never been more plentiful.”

Net zero carbon buildings

As in New York City, which recently announced plans to shrink the carbon footprint of its skyscrapers, Los Angeles’s largest source of emissions isn’t cars but residential and commercial buildings. By 2030, all new buildings in the city will have to be emissions-free. By 2050, every existing building will have to be retrofitted to meet the same goal. The city is also pioneering new construction methods, as the first large city to require all-electric construction equipment on city buildings. “We have to demand the most aggressive emissions reductions coming from our buildings,” says O’Connor.

Zero emissions transportation

Right now, most Angelenos commute to work as the sole occupant of a car. Last year, each one spent an average of 128 hours stuck in traffic. L.A. wants to get more commuters into public transit and is expanding its subway and metro lines to help, along with building new housing next to transit centers. Garcetti says that his administration has paved more streets than any in LA’s history, but “who cares about potholes if Venice is underwater.” The city is also building the infrastructure to help people who keep driving make the switch to electric cars—including 25,000 new electric charging stations by 2025. Crosswalks and routes to walk to school will become safer. To make it easier to walk in hot weather, the city is planting shade trees and adding cool pavements. The network of bike lanes and bike sharing will expand. School buses and taxis will reach zero emissions by 2028; urban delivery vehicles will reach that goal by 2035. By 2050, every vehicle in the city will have zero emissions.

Reducing reliance on imported water

More than a century ago, L.A. essentially stole water from the Owens Valley 200 miles away. The city also relies on water from Northern California and the Colorado River. Now, however, it wants to begin to source the majority of its water locally. Rain that typically flows over pavement and into storm drains will be captured through a “sponge city” design of permeable pavement and rain gardens. All wastewater will be recycled by 2035. As drought becomes more likely, the city will also continue to cut water use.

Environmental justice

As L.A. transforms, the city is focusing particularly on the poorest communities, which have been hardest hit by environmental problems like air pollution in the past. Several projects will directly impact neighborhoods—cutting emissions from ships at the ports, for example, is helping reduce childhood asthma rates in Long Beach. In Watts, the Jordan Downs public housing project is being rebuilt into an affordable community with electric car sharing, solar power, new bike lanes, thousands of new trees, and 50 small urban farms.",['Subsistence - Physiology']
https://www.governing.com/news/headlines/Los-Angeles-City-Workers-Still-Pay-Nothing-for-Healthcare.html,Los Angeles,Los Angeles City Workers Still Pay Nothing for Healthcare,"(TNS) — In a major policy reversal that critics say will cost the city and taxpayers millions of dollars, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has abandoned his long-stated goal of getting the city's public employee unions to pay a portion of their healthcare costs.

Under contracts signed this year that were supported by the mayor, many of City Hall's largest unions will continue to contribute nothing toward their healthcare premiums. Garcetti also backed agreements with several smaller unions, allowing those employees who had been contributing 10% of their premiums to stop paying in January.

The decision is an about-face from what Garcetti told voters while first running for mayor. He had vowed to push city employees to contribute 10% toward the cost of their healthcare.

""You get elected talking tough,"" said Christopher Thornberg, founder of consulting firm Beacon Economics. ""Then you get into office and roll over.""

Critics say Garcetti is ignoring warnings about City Hall's shaky finances, as budget analysts warn of looming deficits. It also reflects how his public relationship with labor unions has shifted from adversarial to friendly since he first ran for mayor.

Garcetti said union leaders persuaded him that requiring contributions would hurt the poorest city employees. He said he instead chose other strategies for cutting costs, such as persuading unions to give up pay raises in certain years.

""I'm agnostic about where you save money,"" he said. ""Whether it's in healthcare or in less of a raise, a dollar is a dollar is a dollar.""

Budget analysts said last month that the city faces annual deficits of $200 million to $400 million because of new labor deals that leave the city on the hook for raises and healthcare costs for police, fire and civilian workers.

L.A.'s practice of paying 100% of the cost of the healthcare premiums for most of its 50,000 city employees — though workers chip in toward co-pays and prescription fees — ""is not typical,"" according to a 2017 city controller audit. The review cited a national study that showed the overwhelming majority of large government employers require employees to chip in.

According to a Times analysis, the city is projected to spend at least $740 million on healthcare for all of its employees this year — a 34% increase over spending in 2013, when Garcetti first took office. The city also is paying more for healthcare in part because of the thousands of employees have been hired in recent years.

Garcetti had said on the campaign trail that year that he'd stand up to public employee unions and rein in rising costs at City Hall.

At the time, Los Angeles was still recovering from a recession that had led to employee furloughs and cuts to basic city services, including sidewalk repairs, tree trimming and street paving. Like other cities across the country, the downturn drained tax revenue. Healthcare, salaries and pension costs for public employees were consuming a concerning share of the city budget.

Today, though, L.A.'s economy is humming along and most of the city's workers still pay nothing toward their healthcare costs.

Garcetti said the city has had success negotiating prices with healthcare companies. This year, he said, there is no rise in civilian healthcare premiums for the city, for example. Overall, that cost has risen 22% since Garcetti first became mayor, his office said.

John J. Pitney Jr., a professor of government at Claremont McKenna College, said there's less pressure on politicians to get labor concessions because the economy has been strong and polls show the public views unions more favorably. At the same time, the national Democratic Party is focused on lowering healthcare costs for individuals.

""In good times, politicians can be more generous,"" Pitney said.

After the 2009 recession plunged L.A. City Hall into financial crisis, then-Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa convinced the group representing engineers and architects to pay 5% toward their healthcare premiums, or about $65 a month. Villaraigosa said at the time it was the first time a union had made such a concession.

The following year in 2011, then-Councilman Garcetti stood next to Villaraigosa at City Hall to announce that city workers had agreed to pay toward their retirement healthcare costs.

The city's largest labor groups declined to endorse Garcetti in the mayor's race two years later, but he used that to his advantage, saying he'd be independent from labor and telling voters he had already won healthcare concessions from workers.

City workers ""have to have some skin in the game, because when healthcare costs triple, they don't feel it,"" Garcetti during at a 2013 debate at Loyola Marymount University.

After winning, Garcetti began paying 10% toward his own healthcare premium as part of a labor deal with City Hall's executives. Several smaller employee groups also began pitching in 5% to 10% toward their healthcare premiums under contracts inked during Garcetti's first term.

But the mayor encountered resistance from the Department of Water and Power's largest union, which refused the concession in its 2013 and 2017 contracts. However, Garcetti and other negotiators convinced the union to forgo raises in its 2013 agreement, which saved the city $385 million, budget analysts said.

The Coalition of L.A. City Unions, the largest civilian employment group representing 20,000 workers, also balked. Its leaders refused to pay the 10% healthcare premium as part of a 2015 contract, though they did agree to defer raises.

Their contract that passed this year also doesn't require a healthcare contribution.

The coalition ""would absolutely never agree"" to it, said City Councilman Paul Koretz, who serves alongside the mayor on a panel that negotiates with unions. Koretz said he was never fully on board with the healthcare concession plan, saying it was hatched during the recession.

Without the backing of the Coalition of L.A. City Unions, city leaders abandoned their goal. Several labor unions that had been contributing to healthcare premiums, including the management labor group of which Garcetti is a member and the union representing engineers and architects, will stop next year.

Members of the Engineers and Architects Assn. also will get a one-time cash payout from the city. Michael Davies, the union's interim executive director, said it was for ""past sacrifices,"" including payments members made toward healthcare.

SEIU Local 721 President Bob Schoonover cast the city's one-time push for healthcare contributions within the broader context of shrinking benefits for middle-class workers across many industries. He called it a ""race-to-the-bottom mentality.""

It's unclear how much money the city could have saved if employees contributed to their healthcare costs, but a 2013 report predicted as much as $50 million annually in savings.

Budget analysts have warned that the city will face deficits in the next four years. City departments were ordered to find ways to reduce costs.

Garcetti said those concerns weren't unusual. He said budget officials always ""warn people that the sky is falling"" in order to push departments to save money.

But Pitney sees risks for Garcetti if a recession squeezes City Hall's budget.

""There is a chance that this could come back and hurt him,"" Pitney said.

https://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-ln-typhus-20190217-story.html,Los Angeles,"Long before City Hall rats, L.A. has struggled with the rise of typhus","Los Angeles officials this month called for an investigation into a vermin infestation at City Hall, after at least one city employee was diagnosed with typhus, a disease spread by rodents.

The rat problem has focused attention on typhus over the last several weeks. But cases of the disease have actually been increasing in California for more than a decade.

Thirteen people in the state were diagnosed with typhus in 2008, compared with 167 last year. More than 95% of the people falling sick in California are in Los Angeles and Orange counties, according to state health data.

Los Angeles City Council President Herb Wesson says he wants to examine the real cause of the typhus cases. On Friday, a giant inflatable rat loomed outside the building while officials inside discussed the vermin issue.

Murine typhus, also known as endemic typhus, typically causes flu-like symptoms, but can in rare cases be fatal. It is not to be confused with typhoid fever, a food-borne illness that is rarely contracted within the United States.

Officials don’t keep count of how many cases of murine typhus there are each year nationwide, but among states that do track the numbers — California, Texas and Hawaii — more people have been falling ill each year, experts say.

Why? Theories abound.

More homelessness

In October, L.A. County officials declared a typhus outbreak in downtown L.A. around skid row. The announcement prompted calls to clean up the streets and find housing for the city’s homeless population, which has burgeoned in recent years.

(Los Angeles Times)

Typhus is often linked to unsanitary conditions and overcrowding, experts say.

Animals including rats and cats carry the disease in their bodies, though it doesn’t make them ill. Fleas transmit the disease to humans by biting the infected animals and then biting humans, something that could become more common as more people live on the streets.

“In major cities in the U.S., we hear about increasing numbers of encampments and people living in squalor,” said Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, a professor at UCLA’s Fielding School of Public Health. “Those conditions are ideal for increase in vermin like rats.”

Among the 19 people who have been infected as part of the typhus outbreak in downtown Los Angeles, eight were homeless, according to the county health department.

Dr. Stuart Cohen, chief of the division of infectious diseases at UC Davis, pointed out that a large outbreak of hepatitis A in San Diego that killed 20 people was also linked to the homeless population.

“It’s the same kind of thing: Homeless populations increase and the amount of garbage that’s available on the street is increasing — the ability to transmit all this other stuff also increases,” he said.

Climate change

The effects of global warming could also be causing more cases of typhus, said Dr. Jeff Duchin, a spokesman for the Infectious Disease Society of America and an infectious-disease professor at the University of Washington.

Longer and warmer spring and summer seasons are more hospitable to insects and allow them to reproduce more, Duchin said. The trend extends beyond typhus and fleas, he said.

Between 2004 and 2016, the number of cases of diseases caused by mosquito, flea and tick bites tripled nationwide, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

More human interaction with wildlife

Recent outbreaks of typhus in Pasadena and Pomona have been linked not to rats — associated with dirty cities — but with stray cats and opossums. Experts say those outbreaks were the consequence of building homes closer to wilderness.

“As some of these suburban areas encroach upon some of these habitats for opossums and other rodents, the chances of getting flea bites and therefore picking up the infection increases,” Cohen said.

During the last typhus outbreak in Los Angeles County, in 2015, a single opossum captured in a mobile home park in Pomona had 1,087 fleas on it. Three-fifths of the fleas tested from the cats and opossums that were trapped tested positive for typhus.

Los Angeles County health officials would not say which animals are to blame for the downtown outbreak. But many people are pointing to rats.

L.A. Councilman Joe Buscaino tweeted a photo last week of a sign at City Hall with tips on how to avoid attracting rodents. City workers say they’ve seen fleas, rodent droppings, and plants being eaten by the vermin in the building.

Buscaino captioned the photo: “It’s all fun and games until someone gets typhus.”

Increased awareness

The symptoms of typhus, which include body aches, fever and stomach pain, tend to resemble other illnesses. Elizabeth Greenwood, the city employee who fell ill with typhus, was first diagnosed with meningitis.

It’s possible that more people learning about typhus in recent years has made it seem that there are more cases, said Gilbert Kersh, the CDC’s chief of the Rickettsial Zoonoses branch, which focuses on bacterial diseases spread by fleas, lice and ticks.

“Once people are aware that it’s in their area, they might start considering it as the diagnosis, and that can lead to revealing more cases that were there already,” he said.

https://www.fastcompany.com/90436610/how-los-angeles-plans-to-get-hundreds-of-thousands-of-people-out-of-cars,Los Angeles,How Los Angeles plans to get hundreds of thousands of people out of cars,"Los Angeles has a reputation as a car-dependent city. But the city (and the surrounding county) also now has the country’s most ambitious plan for cutting emissions from transportation. In less than a decade, it wants the majority of new cars to be electric and all city buses to be electric—and it wants 20% of trips that currently happen in single-occupancy cars to shift to public transportation or active transportation like biking.

Today, a set of partners released the Zero Emissions 2028 Roadmap 2.0, a plan that outlines how the region can drastically cut transit emissions by 2028 to address both climate change and the health impacts of smog. Convincing Angelenos to drive less is a key part of the plan.

“In the modeling, we looked extensively at different scenarios for the number of electric cars and zero-emission trucks that would need to be on the road, and chargers to serve those vehicles,” says Matt Petersen, president and CEO of the Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator, which convened a group of partners last year to set initial targets, now spelled out in more detail. “And we recognize that one of the key ways we’re going to achieve the reduction goal for greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution is mode shift: How do we get people out of their cars into public transit or active transit?”

If they do drive, the city wants them using electric vehicles. To help make the shift easier, the city, county, and other partners plan to blanket the area in 84,000 public and workplace charging stations and add chargers where they’re particularly critical, like at apartment buildings. It will also use incentives to help consumers, especially low-income drivers, afford electric cars. By 2028, 30% of cars on the road will be electric, and 80% of new cars sold will be electric. Larger trucks will also move to electric power, a major road from the port will become the first “zero-emissions goods movement corridor” in the country, and the city will test zero-emissions delivery zones for packages. But to stay on track to cut emissions, the biggest change the city will have to manage is making it easier not to drive at all.

Part of that means improving public transportation, both in the routes that are available and the quality of the experience. The shift to electric buses—which are quieter than rattling diesel or natural gas buses, and often come with amenities such as Wi-Fi and charging—can help. “Those are the kinds of things that are going to make discretionary riders more interested and eager and willing to get out of their cars,” says Petersen.

Expanding micromobility can also help; a recent report in Santa Monica found that 49% of the trips that people were taking on electric scooters and shared bikes were replacing short trips that otherwise would have happened in cars. Some projects now are working to expand access to micromobility in neighborhoods that don’t have many options. Los Angeles Cleantech Incubator, for example, is running a pilot with a nonprofit building a solar-powered e-bike share project in the community of Huntington Park. (Other pilot projects are expanding access to electric car sharing in low-income neighborhoods; if residents use that option instead of owning cars themselves, they also may be likely to drive less.) Designing streets to make it safer to ride a bike—such as a two-way protected bike lane that was installed in downtown L.A. earlier this year—is also a key part of helping people shift away from cars.

The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority also now plans to study the idea of congestion pricing, the type of road fee that London uses to reduce traffic in the city center. (If it happens, it may come with an incentive like free bus service.) In 2017, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti signed the Fossil Fuel Free Streets Declaration, a pledge to “envision a future where walking, cycling, and shared transport are how the majority of citizens move around our cities” and to create a major emissions-free zone.",['Subsistence - Mobility']

Thursday morning temperatures dipped to 21 degrees below zero — minus 39 degrees with wind chill, according to the National Weather Service. That’s just 6 degrees short of the Jan. 20, 1985 record of minus 27, the lowest temperature ever recorded in Chicago.

“I would bet my next paycheck we are not beating the record this time,” NWS meteorologist Gino Izzi said. “It’s extremely unlikely.”

The weather service initially hinted of a possibility that Thursday morning could at least match the 1985 record.

However, the low of 21 degrees below zero Thursday did set a new daily record for Jan. 31 in Chicago, according to NWS. The previous record for the date was set in 1982, when temperatures dropped to minus 12.

And while Chicago won’t break the record for the longest stretch below zero, it’ll crack the top five. After dipping into subzero territory around 6 p.m. Tuesday, temperatures will climb back from the negatives sometime Thursday night, the weather service said.

In Rockford, temperatures reached 31 degrees below zero between 7:05 and 7:15 a.m., setting an all-time record for the coldest temperature since the city started keeping records in 1905, the weather service said. The previous record low in Rockford was minus 27, recorded on Jan. 10, 1982.

Temps fell to -30°F or lower for several locations in north-central Illinois this morning. With a low of -31°F, Rockford broke its all-time record low since records began in 1905. Wind chill values were in the -35 to -45°F range for much of the area. pic.twitter.com/JPHcALiGew — NWS Chicago (@NWSChicago) January 31, 2019

Still, when the temperature dropped to 23 degrees below zero early Wednesday, that meant the Polar Vortex that blew through Chicago this week produced the fifth-lowest temperature since record keeping began in 1871. A wind chill of minus 52 on early Wednesday was the fifth coldest since 1929.

“It’s still really, really, really cold,” said weather service meteorologist Kevin Donofrio. ” … For Chicago, we’re accustomed to things getting cold. But we’re talking about all-time cold.”

Snow on the way

Temperatures climbed to a high of minus 1 on Thursday — though windchill values were still at 43 degrees below zero, the weather service said.

About 1 to 3 inches of snow hit the area later Thursday, the weather service said. More flurries will arrive after 2 a.m. Friday, though temperatures will rise to positive digits soon after that.

The highest snow piles were expected in the southwest suburbs, where up to 4 inches is predicted, the weather service said.

Yet another round of accumulating snow is on the way Thursday PM, with probable impacts to the Thursday evening commute. Leave yourself extra travel time. Be prepared to encounter snow covered roads & slowed, possibly hazardous travel. #ilwx #inwx pic.twitter.com/jDJRkBGo4u — NWS Chicago (@NWSChicago) January 30, 2019

The weather service warned drivers to allow for extra travel time and “possibly hazardous travel” because of accumulating snow and single-digit temperatures impeding road treatment tactics.

70-degree swing?

Chicago’s weather this weekend will likely seem tropical in comparison. Friday afternoon temperatures will climb to a high in the low 20s, while Saturday afternoon’s high is forecasted to be near 40 degrees.

Football fans can look forward to a high of 47 degrees on Sunday as they prepare to watch the Super Bowl, the weather service said. However, rain will likely hit the city starting Saturday and won’t relent until early next week — when more snow arrives.

“Say we get a 70-degree swing in a few days? That’s pretty crazy,” Donofrio said.

This week’s cold snap virtually shut the city down for a day, as everything from flights and public transit to the city’s public school system and mail delivery in ZIP codes in Chicago and around Illinois was canceled for Wednesday and Thursday.

O’Hare International Airport again saw major problems. By noon, 1,467 flights were canceled, according to the Chicago Department of Aviation. At Midway International Airport, 258 flights were canceled. Delays at both airports were averaging less than 15 minutes.

The CTA operated its train and bus service as scheduled, though delays emerged on nearly all lines as rush hour began.

Signal problems at the Howard plagued Yellow, Purple and Red Line trains, according to CTA alerts.

Metra is staying on modified schedules for most of its lines Thursday. Customers are advised to expect longer travel times, as trains must operate with restricted speed when temperatures reach zero degrees or lower, Metra said.

Metra Electric trains will not run Thursday, Metra said. The CTA is accepting Metra tickets at its Red Line stations and bus routes No. 71, 26, 28, 6, J14, 2 and 1.

All Amtrak services on its short-distance trains and most long-distance service trains will also be canceled Thursday, Amtrak said.

Power issues drastically subsided by Thursday as well, with only 155 ComEd customers reporting no power about noon, according to the electric company’s power outage map. In all, some 61,000 people lost power throughout the cold streak, ComEd officials said Wednesday night.

The city also continues to operate 142 of its public buildings and facilities Thursday as warming centers.",['Affection - Aesthetics']

As we approach 2020, more Americans than ever are worried about global warming and climate change, but what exactly is being done about it? The answer: It depends on where you live.

A new study conducted by COMMERCIALCafe has identified 50 U.S. cities that are currently making strides towards sustainability, by providing a “resilient habitat for existing populations without compromising the ability of future generations to experience the same.”

A follow-up to a previous study of the most sustainably powered cities in the U.S., this examination determined which of those cities were making the most progress in going green.

Starting with data from The American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE), the study rated cities based on progress they’ve made in energy-related CO2 emissions reduction, improvements in air quality, differences over time in the share of walking and biking commuters, widening adoption of LEED-certified building practices and growth in environmentally focused occupations.

According to the study, embracing urban sustainability through these avenues is key to not only improving the lives of residents, but increasing a city’s long-term resiliency.

Chicago took the No. 6 spot in the study, due to its goals to improve walkability and access to transportation, as well as its increase in efficient energy usage in lower-income areas. It garnered a total of 61.48 points and surpassed perennial favorites such as Seattle, San Francisco and Austin.

Chicago also gained points for its growth in LEED-certified buildings. Since 2014, the city has added 395 LEED-certified buildings to its inventory, bringing the total to 1,303. Chicago was 2nd overall in terms of its number of LEED-certified buildings in 2019.

Signs point to the fact that these factors are becoming more important to consumers. According to a 2018 poll conducted at Yale University, more than half of Americans (57 percent) say they understand that most scientists agree that global warming is happening, and seven out of 10 Americans now say that global warming is “personally important” to them. While the majority of those polled felt “disgusted” and/or “helpless” nearly half (48 percent) were “hopeful” that something could be done to address climate change.",['Subsistence - Physiology']
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/10/31/us/chicago-cps-teachers-strike.html,Chicago,"Chicago Teachers’ Strike, Longest in Decades, Ends","CHICAGO — More than 300,000 public school students prepared to return to school as Chicago leaders on Thursday announced an end to an acrimonious teachers’ strike that lasted 11 days, the longest here in decades, and turned life upside down for families across the nation’s third-largest school district.

In the end, the clash between the teachers and Chicago’s new mayor, Lori Lightfoot, appeared to have brought mixed results. The city agreed to spend millions of dollars on reducing class sizes; promised to pay for hundreds more social workers, nurses and librarians; and approved a 16 percent salary increase over the coming five years. But not all union members were satisfied; a vote to approve a tentative deal was noticeably split, and some teachers wanted to press on to seek steeper reductions in class sizes, more teacher preparation time and aid for special education.

Still, the strike in Chicago, which followed a series of major teacher walkouts in conservative states like West Virginia and Oklahoma as well as liberal cities like Los Angeles and Denver, reflected a renewed wave of activism from teachers.

“What it says is that West Virginia and Oklahoma wasn’t sui generis; it wasn’t an isolated moment,” said Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers , who made several trips to Chicago during the strike. “This is now a strategy.”",[]
https://www.nrdc.org/experts/chicago-tackle-congestion-and-transportation-inequity,Chicago,Chicago to Tackle Congestion and Transportation Inequity,"Mayor Lightfoot recently introduced one of the country’s most ambitious and equitably structured proposals to price ride-hailing trips, underscoring the city’s commitment to reducing congestion and investing in high-quality transit service for residents all across Chicago.

The proposal is designed to reduce congestion and improve bus service by increasing taxes on all ride-hailing trips in Chicago’s congested core, and on non-shared ride-hailing trips throughout the city. The city plans to reinvest a portion of the revenues into making bus service more reliable to improve transportation options for all Chicagoans and turn around declining bus ridership.

With the Mayor’s proposal, high-income residents are likely to bear much of the fiscal impact. The ride-hailing passengers who will see the biggest price increases will be those who choose to travel by car alone in the downtown zone. Shared rides taken outside the downtown zone, late at night, or on weekends will see a price drop.

The borders of the downtown zone that will be affected by Mayor Lightfoot’s plan. City of Chicago

It has been a well-publicized fact that gridlock in Chicago is getting worse, with vehicle slowdowns experienced citywide, including a recent spike downtown where average speeds decreased by 2.3 percent from 2016 to 2017. There are a number of factors that contribute to traffic congestion, with the relatively recent ascent of the ride-hailing industry being one of them. Over the last three years, the city reported a record 271 percent increase in the use of ride-hailing trips offered by Transportation Network Provider (TNP) companies like Uber, Lyft, and Via. Although Chicago residents have had greater access to the city since the introduction of these services, their growth has also contributed to significant increases in traffic congestion and air pollution in the city.

The Mayor’s proposal makes even more sense when taking a closer look at the detailed report on the effects of TNP companies on congestion recently released by the city. Nearly half of all ride-hailing trips begin or end in the downtown zone, with only 20 percent of these trips requested as shared trips. This competes with cleaner, more efficient transportation options such as the train, bus, bike, or walking, and contributes to poorer air quality and more congestion. As one of the 25 Bloomberg American Cities Climate Challenge cities, Chicago is taking a leadership role in addressing these negative environmental and social impacts.

How Mayor Lightfoot’s Proposal Addresses Congestion Head-On

Mayor Lightfoot’s proposal would create a “downtown zone surcharge” that will be added to both shared and non-shared rides in the downtown zone. Currently, the ground transportation tax sits at $0.60 for all rides, independent of place or time. The surcharge will be added to rides on weekdays from 6am to 10pm, during which time traffic congestion is at its worst downtown. Shared rides starting or ending in the downtown zone will be assessed a $1.13 total tax during surge times, and non-shared rides a total tax of $2.88. Outside the downtown zone, shared ride taxes will decrease to $0.53, while non-shared rides will be assessed $1.13. For TNP users choosing non-shared rides outside the downtown zone, there will be an 88% increase in the ground transportation tax under the proposed fee structure.

Yet passengers will benefit from an almost 12% reduction in the ground transportation tax for shared rides outside of the downtown zone -- providing an important equity benefit to city residents. This is especially important for riders on the South and West sides, where nine out of ten trips go from neighborhood to neighborhood, never entering (nor contributing to congestion in) the downtown zone. Half of these are also requested as shared rides, significantly higher than the city’s average ride-sharing rate. The city reported that only five percent of the rides to Englewood go downtown -- out of 400,000 annual trips.

A few existing special cases will be preserved. Ride taxes for Chicago “Special surcharge zones,” McCormick Place, Navy Pier, and O’Hare and Midway airports will remain the same at $5.00 per ride. This proposed tax increase will not affect Wheelchair Accessible Vehicles, nor will they be subject to the downtown zone surcharge.

Taken together, these changes will incentivize customers to share rides in Chicago while at the same time investing in the city’s bus system, a more reliable and efficient alternative to driving.

Fewer Cars; Faster, More Reliable Buses

This increased tax on TNPs will fund much needed public transportation improvements, making bus service in particular more reliable and accessible to Chicago residents.

The city projects that the proposed congestion pricing will generate over $40 million annually. About $2 million of these funds will be allotted to improving seven priority bus lanes on Chicago’s South and West sides, areas with some of Chicago’s highest-ridership bus routes. These include Halsted Street (#8), Western Avenue (#49), Pulaski Road (#53), 63rd Street (#63), Chicago Avenue (#66), Belmont Avenue (#77) and 79th Street (#79). Access to fast, frequent, affordable, and reliable public transportation is vital to Chicago’s communities. This proposal addresses the challenges many Chicagoans face with limited access to transportation options and unreliable service and demonstrates Mayor Lightfoot’s commitment to making transit work better in communities that need it most.

Equity in Access to Transportation

The city has been working continuously to ensure that residents of Chicago have equitable access to transportation in the city, and the Mayor’s recent proposal is part of a larger strategy designed to improve affordable, high-quality, low-emission transportation options and reduce congestion. The proposal also aligns with Mayor Lightfoot’s platform for Equitable and Efficient Transit.

This year, CTA increased the frequency of bus routes, specifically for those traveling to the South side of Chicago. Their proposed budget for 2020 includes a $310 million dollar investment for the Red Line Extension project. The Red Line Extension project will extend the Red Line 5.3 miles south adding four new, fully accessible stations at 103rd Street, 111th Street, Michigan Avenue, and 130th Street. The project will cost about $2.3 billion total.

Further, the city’s bikeshare network, Divvy, is expanding their access to bikes into the Far North and South sides. By 2021, more than double the current number of bikes will be added to all 50 Chicago wards. 30 new stations will also be added to the neighborhoods of Roseland, Chatham, Morgan Park, Beverly, Washington Heights, Pullman and Auburn Gresham, to hold a total of over 500 new pedal bikes.

Without dismissing the real concerns many Chicagoans have about mayor-elect Lori Lightfoot’s record on police misconduct cases, ties to big-business interests, and other issues, yesterday’s election was most likely a win for Chicago sustainable transportation. As I’ve written, both Lightfoot and her opponent, Cook County board president Toni Preckwinkle, had generally progressive positions on walking, biking, and transit issues.

But Lightfoot, a former federal prosecutor, took more sustainable-transportation-friendly stances on dedicated bike/walk funding, the North Lake Shore Drive reconstruction, camera enforcement of bus lanes, and reduced transit fares for low-income Chicagoans.

She also published a thoughtful and forward-thinking transportation platform that included many of the ideas I might have included if I had written it myself, and cited Streetsblog Chicago as a source. (In fact Streetsblog Chicago’s Steven Vance and Lynda Lopez, along with the Transport Politic’s Yonah Freemark did publish a similar document, the Chicago Sustainable Transportation Platform back in September.)

Here’s a list of some Lightfoot’s key transportation promises from her platform, the Active Transportation Alliance candidate questionnaire, and my email interview with her campaign.

Safety

Renew the city’s commitment to Vision Zero

Earmark $20 million a year for bike and pedestrian safety infrastructure

Traffic enforcement

Convene a panel of experts to evaluate how Chicago should improve its traffic cam network

Audit potential bias in ticketing; Focus police traffic enforcement on promoting public safety

End the police department’s stated practice of using bike enforcement as a pretext for searches

Look into stopping the suspension of drivers’ licenses for nonmoving violations.

Car trip reduction

Draft a Chicago Commute Trip Reduction Ordinance to reward employees who don’t drive to work

Transit

Reduce transit fares for low-income Chicagoans of various ages

Work to ensure every Chicagoan lives within a 15 minute walk of reliable 24-hour transit service

Encourage CTA to implement all-door bus boarding

Work with state legislators to permit fair camera enforcement of bus lanes

Revisit Ashland bus rapid transit plan, possibly with more left turns than originally proposed

Create 50 miles of dedicated bus lanes (Chicago currently only has 4.1 miles)

Support the creation of dedicated transit lanes as part of North LSD reconstruction

Develop a strategy for transitioning Chicago’s bus fleet to electric-only by 2030 or earlier

Upgrade the Metra Electric District line with frequent service and discounted CTA transfers

Equitable transit-oriented development

Increase the number of required affordable units in TODs from the current 10% to 15%.

Support efforts to spur equitable TOD on the South and West sides

Ride-hailing

Align licensing fees and background check requirements for taxi and ride-hailing industries

Increase fees for ride-hailing trips that begin in the Loop and use the revenue to fund transit

Implement fee for ride-hailing vehicles that operate within Chicago but are registered elsewhere

Biking

Install 100 miles of bikeways, including 50 miles of protected lanes

Build a continuous Chicago river trail

Work with regional partners to develop bike/ped paths that connect downtown Chicago to the suburbs

In the wake of Lightfoot’s victory, transportation advocates have expressed optimism about her big plans to improve the local transportation network. They’ve also stressed the need to hold her accountable for following through on these promises despite the car-centric headwinds she will surely encounter.

“The election is over and Mayor-elect Lightfoot must quickly get to work building a transportation network in which everyone can get where they need to go,” wrote Active Trans’ Kyle Whitehead in a blog post today. “As mayor, Lori Lightfoot can reduce traffic crashes and ease congestion by making it easier to get around without driving or riding alone in a car.”

This morning Freemark, a former Metropolitan Planning Council employee who currently lives in Boston, tweeted out a condensed list of Lightfoot’s transportation pledges (which helped inspire this post), and had this advice for Chicago residents:

These are big ideas that will be controversial for some. It is up to Chicagoans to push Lightfoot to ensure that she sticks to these plans. As Chicago’s mayor she’ll control both the streets (CDOT) and transit (CTA)—so she has the ability to make these things happen. — Yonah Freemark (@yfreemark) April 3, 2019

Rest assured, Streetsblog Chicago will be here to remind Lightfoot of her promises to help create a safer, more efficient, more equitable, and more vibrant transportation system; cheerlead her accomplishments in this area; and, if necessary, call out her administration when the plans get off track. But if all goes well, the next four years should be an exciting time for Chicago transportation.

https://www.chicagobusiness.com/lightfoot-100/can-transportation-equity-happen-chicago,Chicago,Can transportation equity happen in Chicago?,"Chicago has the second-largest transit network among U.S. cities, but depending on where you live, it can feel like a transit desert.

Consistent with the Metropolitan Planning Council’s ""Cost of Segregation"" findings, further analysis found Chicago’s black and brown communities are disproportionately affected by longer commute times. A resident of Chicago’s South Shore neighborhood who looks forward to benefiting from the jobs juggernaut of the O’Hare terminal modernization would have to stomach a 90-minute transit commute each way.

At the same time, gridlock in the Loop is getting worse. While ride-share companies like Uber and Lyft generated about 2 million trips locally each month back in 2015, that number grew to 9 million trips each month in 2018. And almost half of those solo riders are taking short trips between the Loop and North Side where transit is often plentiful, adding to hassles and delays for walkers, bikers and drivers.

There are no easy fixes to increasing transportation mobility, accessibility and equity. But there are promising steps Mayor Lightfoot can take, even in her first 100 days. Many are detailed in three bold transportation blueprints, including one issued just this March. Two ideas that can be championed immediately by the Lightfoot administration: rewarding businesses that encourage transit use and helping transit commuters who need it most.

First up, fairer fares. CTA offers discounted rides for children, students, the elderly and people with disabilities. There are no price breaks for low-income individuals. Last year, MPC released ""Our Equitable Future,"" a policy road map to increase equity and inclusion.

One recommendation, a 50 percent transit fare subsidy for adults living below the federal poverty line (10 to 15 percent of transit riders), would cost $25 million to $50 million annually, but the return on investment to our regional economy could be even bigger. By lowering the financial burden of transportation, residents will have easier access to employment, education, health care, and more, leading to more stable families and neighborhoods.",['Subsistence - Mobility']
https://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/03/us/chicago-gun-violence-stats-and-families/index.html,Chicago,The decreasing crime numbers in Chicago are little comfort to families impacted by violence,"Chicago (CNN) In an encouraging trend, the number of murders and shootings in Chicago is down more than 10% this year, compared with the same time period in 2018, authorities report. But the statistics mean little to the families whose lives have been forever changed after losing a loved one to violence.

Homicides spiked three years ago in the city, topping 700 for the first time in decades. Since 2016, there's been a year-over-year decline.

Through September of this year, there have been 1,633 shootings, according to statistics from the Chicago Police Department . In the same time period last year, there were 1,836 shootings recorded. At least 382 people have been murdered so far this year, while last year the number at the end of September stood at 429.

Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot said the data is promising, but people need to feel the change.

""The perception and the reality of safety are really, really important,"" Lightfoot told CNN. ""What they're looking at is, do I feel safe to leave my home? Do I feel safe to send my child out during the daylight hours? Do I feel like I've got to get home before darkfall? Those are the things that people are using as their own barometers.""

Thursday, the House Energy & Commerce Subcommittee on Health held a rare field meeting on gun violence, convening in the Windy City's Kennedy-King College to discuss ""the public health impact of gun violence, the role of gun violence public health research, and prevention approaches,"" according to the committee's website.

JUST WATCHED Chicago police chief: What more is it going to take? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Chicago police chief: What more is it going to take? 00:54

The hearing brought together city officials, doctors, and those personally affected by the issue, many of whom agreed with California Rep. Anna Eshoo's suggestion that the violence is a public health emergency.

Chicago Pastor Brenda Mitchell, who lost her brother and her son to gun violence, spoke during the meeting.

""We have children in Chicago who aren't worried about growing up to be a doctor or lawyer, they're worrying about growing up, period,"" she said.

'He was a gentle soul'

Despite the overall improvements in Chicago's crime statistics, there are hundreds of families whose lives have been irretrievably changed by the violence.

Demetrius Flowers, 33, was among the seven killed and more than 50 wounded over a single weekend in August. The father of three was set to be married on August 23.

Pictures and memories are all Keith Flowers has left of his son.

The night his son was shot, Flowers rushed to the hospital, where he was told to wait. He feared the worst. Then, even after his son was pronounced dead, Flowers said he wasn't able to see him until days later. It still haunts him.

""He was back there alone. There wasn't nobody holding his hand. He couldn't see his mama, he couldn't see his father,"" said Flowers, fighting back tears. ""Nobody cared enough for a black young youth... to die alone like that like he was an enemy of the state.""

'It doesn't stop'

For hospital employees, it's become a predictable cycle. During nighttime hours and on weekends, they can almost anticipate an influx of patients. Dr. Faran Bokhari is the director of Trauma and Burns Surgery at Stroger Hospital in Chicago.

Among his patients are people shot by handguns and those wounded by firearms that do even greater damage.

""You have very large injuries, parts of bodies are missing, and that's the patient you're left to resuscitate,"" said Bokhari.

In some cases, it's not only the nature of the wounds, but also the sheer number of patients that at times can overwhelm a hospital's resources. On the same early morning that Demetrius Flowers was killed, Mount Sinai Hospital on Chicago's west side had to temporarily stop accepting patients because they were at capacity following a series of shootings.

It was the same hospital Flowers was taken to just before the hospital went ""on bypass.""

'What we're seeing are crimes that are precipitated by a lack of investment'

What remains to be seen is if the improved crime stats are the beginning of a long-term trend, or if they're just a temporary dip.

Mayor Lightfoot is the first to admit there's still more work to be done, and she says a long-term solution isn't just going to come from police on the ground.

""Our law enforcement partners from federal, state, and local obviously have a role to play, but it's got to be a much more holistic approach,"" said Lightfoot. ""What we're seeing are crimes that are precipitated by a lack of investment, a lack of hope, a lack of connectivity to legitimate economy. You're not going to solve those deep systemic problems by just putting more police on the street.""

In some cases, officials point to something as simple as having more data being a tremendous step in the right direction. Dr. Jay Shannon is the CEO of the Cook County Health System, which covers Chicago. He says more federal resources are needed to move toward a solution.

""We had a scare about Ebola a few years ago, tens of millions of dollars poured into research funding around that. Four Americans ... contracted Ebola,"" said Shannon. ""We've got a condition here that's killing almost 40,000 Americans each year and we don't have a nickel of federally funded research to address it.""

Part of what he's referring to is the so-called ""Dickey Amendment,"" passed in 1996, that restricted funds for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from being used to advocate or promote gun control. Critics of the amendment say it ultimately led to the CDC halting gun violence research.

On the policy side, Lightfoot said there is only so much she can do within her city.

""If you can drive across to Indiana and buy military-grade firearms and bring them back to Chicago without anyone knowing, without any background checks, that's a problem. And the only way to solve that problem is for Congress to step up and do its job.""

As policy debates play out both in Chicago and Washington, wounded patients continue to come into the city's hospitals day after day, night after night. ""Oh, it doesn't stop,"" said Bokhari.",['Protection - Security']
https://www.chicagobusiness.com/news/chicago-still-losing-population,Chicago,Chicago is still losing population,"So who’s winning? The fastest-growing metropolitan statistical areas were Austin, Texas; Orlando, Fla.; Las Vegas; Raleigh, N.C.; and Phoenix—which grew between 2 and 2.5 percent. The fastest growth among all metro areas was in the oil patch of Texas: Midland grew 4.3 percent. Odessa, Texas, was fifth-fastest at 3.2 percent. The fastest-growing county of more than 20,000 was Williams County, N.D., another hot spot for oil exploration, where the population grew 5.9 percent last year to 35,350.

In Illinois, Danville, which has struggled with a steady decline in manufacturing and population for more than a generation, registered the fourth-worst decline among the nation’s metro areas, losing 1.2 percent. Peoria also was hard-hit, which lost 0.9 percent. The sharpest decline in Illinois was in Alexander County, at the southern tip of the state, which lost 3.8 percent of its residents. Its population is down 26 percent since 2010 to just 6,060 people.

RACIAL FACTORS

The population decline in Chicago and the state, which started shrinking a year earlier than the metro area, has provided a gloomy backdrop to an already-contentious climate in which political leaders are wrestling with tax increases and service cuts to deal with a fiscal mess caused by pension obligations that have been neglected for nearly a generation.

City-level estimates aren't yet available. But, based on recent trends, demographers suspect that Chicago continues to suffer from a declining African-American population in the city and an exodus of older, white residents in Cook County suburbs. “If there was a stable black population, the city and the county would be growing,” Paral says.

A CITY OF IMMIGRANTS?

While the debate over immigration rages in Washington, it’s hitting home in Chicago and other large cities. Since 2010, international immigration to Chicago has dropped by more than half, to roughly 200,000, estimates the Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning. Between 2000 and 2010, it was about 440,000.

That’s a big deal to a region where 1 in 5 workers are foreign-born.

“Chicago has the lowest international immigration rate among its peer metropolitan areas, albeit international immigration to these now-shrinking regions has generally stagnated in more recent years,” the agency says. Two exceptions are Boston and Philadelphia, both of which showed overall growth last year, and have since recovered and surpassed their pre-recession immigration rates.

“Chicago has returned to pre-recession domestic outmigration rates. Our peers haven’t,” said Aseal Tineh, an associate policy analyst for CMAP.

Last year, CMAP estimates 25,000 international migrants came to Chicago, compared with 38,000 international migrants in 2005. When it comes to immigration, each city is unique. Chicago has felt the impact of a decline in the U.S.-Mexico relationship and an improved economy in Eastern Europe.

Mexican immigrants made up 41 percent of Chicago’s foreign-born population. By 2017, they were 37 percent, according to CMAP.

In 2017, the Chicago region was home to 630,000 Mexican-born residents, 40,000 fewer than in 2005, CMAP says. “The decline in Mexican immigration has contributed to the overall stagnation in international immigration to the region.”

That impacts Chicago in another key way, says Johnson. “Birth rates are down 10 percent from a decade ago, even though there are more women of childbearing age. Among Hispanic women in their early 20s, birth rates are down 40 percent.”

The Asian-born population in Chicago is up to 29 percent from 23.4 percent in 2005. But the European-born segment has dropped from 24.6 percent to 21.4 percent. Paral estimates the number of Polish immigrants to Illinois has fallen by half since 2000. “During the '80s and '90s, the city and state had huge immigration, so there was overall growth,” he says. “That’s changed.”

This story has been corrected to show the population of 14-county metropolitan area, not Cook County, fell below 9.5 million for the first time.",[]
https://chicago.curbed.com/2019/3/22/18277352/best-month-to-rent-chicago,Chicago,The best and worst times to rent in Chicago,"Conventional wisdom suggests that it’s cheaper to rent in the winter compared to the summer. But does this hold true in Chicago, a city known for its dramatic shifts in seasonal weather? According to a recent report from Renthop examining monthly rental prices in the nation’s ten most populous cities, the answer is a strong yes.

Based on the data, rents in Chicago tend to peak around September and October. Prices dip to their lowest levels in March and April, which is later in the year compared to the other cities in the report—possibly attributed to Chicago’s “dreaded winter,” says Renthop.

Of the ten cities in the report, Chicago had the highest seasonality when it came to two-bedroom apartments, equating to a 7.1 percent swing. For Chicago’s one-bedroom units, the study found the seasonal differential to be 4.3 percent—second highest behind only New York’s 4.7 percent shift.

Beyond renters wanting to avoid the hassle of dragging their belongings through a foot of wintery slush, what other factors influence price seasonality?

Generally speaking, students and graduates entering the job market tend to relocate in the summer. The same holds true for families wanting to avoid the disruption of moving during the academic school year. These renters often tend to stick to the same annual lease renewal schedule.

Based on 2018 median rental prices, the study concluded that the peak differentials for Chicago one- and two-bedroom apartments equate to $80 and $176 per month, respectively. So is it worth it to try to time your move and capitalize on the winter lull? It depends.

While demand for apartments dips during the colder months, often so does the supply. You might pay slightly less, but you may have fewer options from which to choose, Curbed’s Jeff Andrews explains. The lower rents offered during a down period can be a consideration, but probably not be the deciding factor behind your move.

“We always tell people you shouldn’t try to time the market,” says Aaron Terrazas, Zillow’s director of economic research. “You should move or buy a home because big life changes are happening—you need an extra bedroom because you’re having a kid, [or] you’re retiring and moving to a different climate. Those are the reasons to move, not because of a couple dollars difference in timing the market.”",['Subsistence - Living Space']
https://www.rcreader.com/commentary/causes-effects-chicago-murder-rate,Chicago,Causes and Effects of Chicago's Murder Rate,"The Chicago Police Department reported last week that the number of people murdered in the city fell 10 percent during the first four months of 2019 compared to last year during the same period.

While that's good news and part of a two-year downward trend, lost in much of the coverage was a worrisome murder spike in the month of April.

The Chicago Sun-Times counted 62 Chicago homicides in April, up from 37 in April of last year and 48 in April of 2017.

It's too early to tell whether this is an aberration or a trend. The city's Mayor-elect Lori Lightfoot has been busily meeting with law-enforcement officials over the past several days in an attempt to develop a plan before she takes office on May 20 and before summer starts, when street violence tends to increase as the weather warms.

Governor JB Pritzker spent over a year on the campaign trail talking about his strong belief that violence is a public-health issue. I happen to agree with him on this. We cannot police ourselves completely out of this problem. Violence often spreads like a disease and research has shown when it's treated as such, the contagion can be slowed or even halted.

As an integral part of treating violence as a public health issue, Pritzker touted his support for violence-interruption programs, which do things such as mediate conflicts between rival individuals and groups and try to prevent retaliations from spiraling out of control.

After then-Governor Bruce Rauner blamed the city's crime problem on the lack of jobs and even illegal immigrants, Pritzker countered during a debate last October by laying at least some of the blame at Rauner's feet.

""Gun violence across the state of Illinois has gone up in the very same period that Governor Rauner refused to compromise on a budget,"" Pritzker said during the debate. ""So many of the violence interruption services, human services that people have as their last vestige of connection with civilization, have gone away.""

Indeed, the General Assembly had appropriated $4.7 million for violence interruption programs in Fiscal Year 2015, Rauner's first year in office. But Governor Rauner stopped spending that money and then nothing was appropriated for the following fiscal year, which began July 1.

Shootings spiked almost immediately.

In all of 2014, before Governor Rauner took office, 415 people were murdered in Chicago. Rauner, who didn't recognize the connection between violence and public health, was inaugurated in January of 2015 and the number of murders rose to 468.

The city saw another huge increase in violence in 2016, with murders soaring to 750.

But violence-prevention funding was mostly restored after taxes were raised over Rauner's July 2017 veto. The murder rate began to decline, dropping to 650.

Not all of this trend can be attributed to violence interruption services, of course. But the one Chicago community that managed to secure non-state violence interruption funding in 2015 was the only one spared from that year's bloody surge in killings.

On his first full day in office this past January, Governor Pritzker told reporters he wanted to expand violence-interruption programs.

""Those programs have been decimated across the state. And so we should be focusing on interrupting violence as much as possible,"" the governor said.

And as he approached his first 100 days in office, Pritzker told ABC 7's Craig Wall: ""The fact is violence-interruption programs addressing the issues that prevent violence before it occurs, that's the most effective thing that we can do.""

Pritzker also touted an increase in anti-violence funding during his February budget address. ""This budget adds funds for community-based violence interruption,"" he told lawmakers.

The governor never actually said how much he was proposing to add to the program, but it turns out his requested increase is a mere $2 million.

Every little bit helps, obviously, and nobody is complaining yet, but the money doesn't appear to match the governor's soaring rhetoric.

When I asked the administration why more wasn't appropriated, I was told there just isn't enough available state money to go around to fund all of the things the governor wants to do, ergo his push for a graduated income tax.

Pritzker is right that these programs work, and Chicago isn't the only Illinois city that has benefited from them over the years. Somehow, we need to find a way to do more.

https://chicago.suntimes.com/crossroads/2019/9/20/20870524/climate-change-chicago-global-warming-trends-ed-zotti-city-crossroads,Chicago,Climate change in Chicago isn’t playing out exactly as it has been nationwide — not yet,"After a January of near-record cold and a rainy, chilly spring followed by a summer of mostly moderate temperatures, Chicagoans might be thinking: This isn’t the global warming scenario we were led to expect — that it’s going to get really hot:

As the city’s Chicago Climate Action Plan website says of climate change: “The most obvious change to come could be hotter summers and more frequent and intense heat waves. Hot days could feel even hotter because of higher humidity. More heat waves will mean more heat-related illness and deterioration in the quality of air we breathe.”

The plan, published in 2008, says: “A Chicago summer late in this century could feel like that of Mobile, Alabama, today. By the end of the century, the number of extremely hot days (over 100°F) could increase from the current two days per year to as many as 31 days per year.”

The Union of Concerned Scientists echoes that: “Scientists project that heat-related deaths [in Chicago] are likely to quadruple by 2050. An event like the deadly 1995 heat wave could occur three times a year by the end of this century.”

Other than climate-change deniers, no one is saying such things won’t happen eventually. Chicago and the entire country indisputably are getting warmer, especially over the past 20 years. But the changes are playing out in unexpected ways that, in some respects, are at odds with what’s happening nationwide.

The chart below shows how the average annual daily high temperature in Chicago, as measured at Midway Airport since 1928, departs from the long-term norm compared to the United States overall, based on data from the Midwestern Regional Climate Center at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s National Centers for Environmental Information.

Daily highs have been rising in Chicago and nationally — but U.S. highs are rising faster. Beginning in 1998, the yearly average high temperature nationally has been above normal every single year.

Not so in Chicago. The city continues to have colder-than-normal years every so often, though less frequently than it once did.

The next chart shows the average annual daily low temperature for Chicago vs. the nation.

This chart tells a much different story. Daily lows in Chicago have been rising much faster than nationally — a trend that began in the 1980s. Since 1986, Chicago lows have been above normal most years, often outpacing the country as a whole by a wide margin.

To put it another way, the United States is warming up a little faster than Chicago during the day — but Chicago is warming up much faster than the country as a whole at night.

The shift was especially dramatic between 1982, the last in a string of cold years in Chicago, and the unusually warm year of 1998 — by more than seven degrees.

It’s as if someone threw on an extra blanket. And, in a way, that’s what happened. Illinois state climatologist Trent Ford attributes the unexpected warming trend in Chicago and the Midwest generally to higher humidity and more cloud cover. During the day, clouds act as an umbrella, limiting solar heating. At night, they act as a blanket, preventing the warmth from radiating away.

Chicago’s climate tracks most closely with the national trend in winter. During cold-weather months, the city sees greater swings in average temperature from year to year than is true of the entire country, but the city and the nation are warming up at similar rates.

Summers are another matter. Here’s the trend for summertime lows:

And here’s the trend for summertime highs:

Several things jump out.

The national trend is flat — summertime highs, on average, have changed little in the United States the past 90 years.

Fluctuations in summertime highs in Chicago, always greater than for the U.S. overall, became more extreme starting in 1983, and the extremes began occurring more frequently.

Seemingly at odds with the experts’ predictions, the trend in Chicago’s summertime highs is down.

That Chicago has largely dodged the global warming bullet doesn’t mean our luck will hold indefinitely.

“The lack of an upward trend in summer max temperature and projections of more frequent heat waves in Chicago seem paradoxical,” Ford says. “However, climate change works in a non-linear fashion. What we experience today and the changes we’ve seen over the last several decades aren’t necessarily good indicators of what’s to come.

“So it’s entirely credible to state two facts: First, summertime maximum temperatures in Chicago haven’t increased appreciably over the last several decades. And, second, state-of-the-art climate-model projections show considerable increases in the frequency and intensity of summertime extreme heat in Chicago over the next century.”

Here’s why things could start getting a lot worse. As the charts show, Chicago has had some exceptionally hot summers since 1983. What was different about the killer heat wave of 1995 was that, in contrast to other hot summers, the daily highs and lows both were much warmer than the norm, with high humidity. During the hottest stretch, the temperature didn’t drop even at night. That’s why so many — 700 — died.

That doesn’t bode well. Two trends are at work.

Chicago’s overnight lows are steadily rising.

And sharp increases in summertime highs, though still relatively rare, are becoming more common.

If those trends continue, hot summer days will be followed more often by hot summer nights.

We’re not there yet. Despite a slow start and some hot days, this summer turned out to be delightful, with plenty of sun, moderate humidity and a pleasant mix of temperatures, hot days followed by cooler ones.

Still, the common view among climate scientists is that we face an unpleasant future in Chicago and worldwide. We need to prepare for the worst — and hope we continue to avoid it.

https://chicago.suntimes.com/2019/10/21/20925766/chicago-neighborhoods-250-million-investment-south-west-sides-lightfoot,Chicago,"$250 million will bring ‘transformative change’ to 10 South, West side neighborhoods, Lightfoot says","Chicago will spend $250 million over the next three years to bring “transformative change” to ten South and West Side neighborhoods “starving for too long,” Mayor Lori Lightfoot said Monday.

“We are bringing the whole of government to these efforts. ... We will be creating targeted workforce programs and transforming our use of public owned land to encourage development,” the mayor told a standing-room-only news conference on Chicago Avenue in Austin.

“This is what a truly cross-sector, comprehensive investment plan for our South and West Side looks like. ... The city is here. The city will stay. We will not be transactional. We will not leave you. We will lead and invite others to follow in our path.”

The 10 neighborhoods targeted for the unprecedented infusion of city capital are: Auburn Gresham, North Lawndale, Austin, Englewood, Humboldt Park, Quad Communities, New City, Roseland, South Chicago and South Shore.

Factors analyzed in choosing the neighborhoods included: local business activity; retail and institutional anchors; transportation amenities; historic buildings; recent and pending public improvements; potential community partners.

The $250 million, Lightfoot said, is “re-prioritized money already in the pipeline” from: tax-increment-financing; the moribund $100 million Catalyst Fund; the Small Business Improvement Fund; and the share-the-wealth, Neighborhood Opportunity Fund generated by developers paying a fee for permission to build bigger and taller buildings downtown.

Together with $500 million in CTA, Metra and Park District improvements already in the pipeline — and a $10 million sponsorship from BMO Harris Bank — the goal of the program the mayor calls “Invest South/West” is to turn abandoned commercial corridors into thriving inner-city neighborhoods with the amenities needed to attract residents, not lose them.

“While our Central Business District has been thriving, families on our South and West Sides have been leaving. … These are families who aren’t leaving because they want to, but because they feel like they have to. If anyone wanted an indication of a flawed economic plan, that is it.” the mayor said.

Former Mayor Richard M. Daley built dozens of neighborhood libraries, police and fire stations and used those projects as catalysts for neighborhood development.

Former Mayor Rahm Emanuel did the same with the police academy in West Garfield Park and the new fleet maintenance facility in Englewood and by moving the administrative headquarters for City Colleges of Chicago. He also created the Neighborhood Opportunity Fund.

Lightfoot was asked how her plan to revive long-neglected South and West Side neighborhoods — with strong input from local advisory panels — will be different.

“What you’ve seen in the past is, we’ll put money in and we’ll have one- off projects here. We’ll put some [more] money in and we’ll have another one off-project. We want to have a comprehensive plan that really brings communities together and builds upon the infrastructure that’s already there,” the mayor said.

“Austin and a lot of other neighborhoods across the city have done community, quality-of-life plans, but they’ve been on a shelf because there hasn’t been the resources to bring those projects to life. We want to change that.”

In July, Lightfoot wrapped up a neighborhood listening tour by promising “transformative” investments in the long-neglected South and West sides.

She reiterated that promise after a ceremony marking the 100th anniversary of the 1919 Chicago race riots, a “bitter and shameful chapter” that, she claimed, represents not only Chicago’s past, but its present.

On Monday, the mayor finally got around to launching her “Marshall Plan.”

“I have been chomping at the bit for months to be able to stand here in this moment. And I said, with due respect to my friends on the South Side, when we make this announcement, we must come to the West Side,” the mayor said.

Newly appointed Planning and Development Commissioner Maurice Cox championed “20-minute neighborhoods” during his stint in Detroit. He’s bringing that same vision to what he called the “first true effort to improve the historic corridors” of Chicago’s South and West Sides.

“The investments are going to be layered. They’re going to be catalytic. They’re going to be very, very visible,” Cox said.

“The idea is to focus like a laser on the areas that are most walkable and most viable within those communities so that residents ... can see the change to the stores that they shop in, to the services that they need in their neighborhoods, to the train stations to the parks where their children play and all of those arts and cultural institutions that we know are right here and can be lifted up.”",['Participation - Community']

In 2018 Streetsblog Chicago editor John Greenfield collaborated with illustrator Joe Mills and the Chicago Reader on the first version of the Mellow Chicago Bike Map, which highlighted low-stress bike routes in the central city. Earlier this month John, Joe, and the Reader released the Simplified, Citywide Mellow Chicago Bike Map, which goes to the city limits and beyond.

The Illustrated version of the map is available as a two-page centerfold in the current issue of the free paper, which is available at these locations through the afternoon of Thursday, July 24, at these distribution locations around Chicago. The SCMCBM is also available as a much more detailed Google Map for laptop or smartphone navigation. Here’s the backstory of how the new version of the map came to be.

The need for a good Chicago bike map has never been greater.

As I write this, our city is in Phase Four reopening after being devastated by COVID-19, and workplaces have opened their doors again. CTA ridership fell by 80 percent during the pandemic, and many Chicagoans are still avoiding transit, so if we don’t provide safe alternatives to cars for socially distanced trips, we’re sure to see a serious spike in driving, congestion, pollution, and traffic deaths.

For months now, peer cities across the country and around the world have been taking action to facilitate safe, socially distanced walking and biking and prevent future carmageddon by repurposing parking and travel lanes to widen sidewalks and create emergency bus and bike lanes. There’s also a nationwide movement to create “Slow Streets,” residential roadways where through traffic is banned so people can safely walk, roll, jog, and bike in the street, creating corridors for transportation and recreation. That’s crucial, because the United States is currently seeing a major biking boom.

Chicago was late to the party, having done almost nothing to make more room for walking, transit, and cycling during the first few months of the crisis. Meanwhile, Mayor Lori Lightfoot closed the Lakefront Trail and the 606 for about three months, eliminating about 21.5 miles of car-free commuting corridors.

Thankfully those key corridors have reopened with restrictions, and the city has been gradually rolling out several miles of Slow Streets in neighborhoods like South Shore, Kenwood-Oakland, Bucktown, Logan Square, and Ravenswood. But we’re still way behind other U.S. cities. For example, Oakland, California, with a fraction of the population of Chicago, is doing 74 miles of Slow Streets, many times more than our city.

But rather than curse the darkness, we at the Reader decided to light a candle by speeding up the release of the citywide version of our Mellow Chicago Bike Map, which originally covered the area bounded by 95th, Cicero, Devon, and Lake Michigan. This new version stretches from Morgan Park to Rogers Park, Edison Park to Hegewisch, offering low-stress alternative routes, mostly on side streets.

They’re ideal for people from all over town who want to try biking as a socially distanced way to get around that’s also healthy, affordable, good for the environment, and super fun. But even seasoned cyclists will appreciate these quiet, serene roadways where shade offers relief from the summer heat.

If you’re in a hurry and need more direct routes, the city of Chicago’s official bike map is useful for finding marked bikeways on main streets. To avoid clutter on this larger edition of the map, it doesn’t include the points of interest and restaurant and bar recommendations from the original central-city version, but you can still view those at tinyurl.com/MellowChicagoMap.

While I think these routes are generally better for bicyclists, you still should be careful anytime you ride in the city. Feel free to drop me a line with any suggestions for improvements or additions at jgreenfield[at]streetsblog.org.

Some notes:

—I’ve tried to create a grid of low-stress north-south and east-west routes within the city of Chicago, spaced roughly a mile apart.

—To keep the map from getting too cluttered, main-street bikeways, including most diagonal streets, generally aren’t shown—check out the city’s map for these.

—Some routes include a short stretch of sidewalk, or a block where you might have to ride the wrong way on a one-way street. To follow the letter of the law, please dismount and walk your bike at these locations.

As startling as that figure is, it’s not news, says Dr. David Ansell, a primary care physician and senior vice president for community health at Rush University. “We’ve known this for years, and it’s just now gotten the attention of the public and others. That 30-year (life expectancy) age gap has been known for a long time,” he said.

A similar report was released last year, when the group West Side United announced a 16-year life expectancy gap between residents of West Garfield Park and the Loop. The group is made up of a coalition of local health care institutions and professionals, including Rush.

Ansell says health outcomes are not strictly a result of biology, behavior or beliefs. “Social conditions themselves … create these terrible gaps in disease and premature mortality.” Those health inequities are the subject of a new book co-authored by Ansell that details nearly a century of research on how Chicago’s structural and socioeconomic inequalities have impacted patients and hospitals.

While many people believe the term “health equity” means equal access to care, it actually means everyone has an equal opportunity to be healthy, according to Ansell. “Every man, woman and child should have the chance to lead a long and healthy life,” he said, adding that equal access to care is an important part of that.

“What seems to be driving the large gaps in life expectancy you see in Chicago are actually differences in social conditions under which people live, play and work,” he said.

Structural racism, a lack of investment in communities, and concentrated poverty are examples of social and structural conditions that contribute to Chicago’s health inequities. “These are forms of afflictions because in some ways they cause disease,” said Ansell. “There are solutions to them, but it’s not just health care alone.”

West Side United is one such effort to address health inequities. It launched last year to address social and structural determinants of health on the West Side. In the past two years the group has raised $10.5 million to invest in educational and employment opportunities on the West Side, among other things.

But to truly make an impact, all Chicagoans need to be involved, says Ansell. “We all have to worry about this. This affects all of us,” he said. “We all take great pride in our city, but we have to do a lot more to make sure everyone has access to the opportunities that lead to good health and then we won’t see these inequities.”

Those acts can be small. Last summer, a Rush medical student organized Saturday walks in Garfield Park with Rush employees. “These are beautiful neighborhoods, and people who live in these neighborhoods love their neighborhood and don’t like all the bad news about it,” Ansell said.

“We need to change the story of neighborhoods of being ‘of risk’ to them being neighborhoods of opportunity and great assets,” he said. “Sometimes you just have to show up.”

The global demand for a low-carbon future is undeniable. Scientific research, opinion pieces, political speechmaking and the global marketplace are all speaking loudly. The question is how? At what pace? At what cost?

And despite all the talk, the real leadership will be shown through actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions while also meeting the growing global demand for energy.

Houston and Texas must embrace a new mantle - Sustainable Energy Capital of the World, the place where new technologies and new policies are put into practice. This only makes sense: Texas not only produces the oil, natural gas, transportation fuels and plastics that allow the nation to thrive, but Texas also has the infrastructure in place - pipelines, transmission lines, storage tanks, rail and port access - that will be required if we are to transform carbon emissions into viable commercial products.

Texas contributes significantly to the energy mix and products demanded by modern life. Globally the economic uplifting of entire countries and the continued growth of population and prosperity means that demand for energy and material goods will continue to grow, and we must ensure that these products remain affordable and become more environmentally friendly. The solution will largely fall to the energy industries in the states and countries that produce energy to embrace this future as an opportunity.

On HoustonChronicle.com: Renewables presence expands at OTC

That means Houston, and Texas, will be critical to success. And we have the good fortune to have forward-thinking, global energy companies that recognize this coming change. Virtually all of them have a strong presence in Houston.

Texans know renewables are important, today and for the future, as the state produces more wind-generated electricity than all but six countries. The amount of solar is growing rapidly. We must strategically integrate all sources of renewables and promote electrification via clean sources of energy. This is not simply good for the environment - it will offer benefits to consumers and create value for the industries.

Texas also consumes twice as much oil, gas and coal as any other state, by virtue of our large manufacturing base, so it falls to us to create this transformation to a low-carbon future.

This transformation will require more than the efficient and lower carbon production and generation of energy. For example, Texas has led the country in the integration of industry with infrastructure and demonstrated how to reduce and capture CO2 emissions in a way that is both cost-effective and useful, storing carbon dioxide in geologic formations and using it for enhanced oil recovery.

Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage (CCUS) has been practiced for over 50 years in Texas, used both in the Permian and East Texas for enhanced oil recovery with great success. There are challenges and opportunities for methane, as well. The primary component of natural gas, methane is also a valuable fuel and feedstock for petrochemicals.

We must invest in transformative technologies that will allow us to view carbon and methane as not simply a waste to be disposed of, but an opportunity to lead the nation in both eliminating emissions and creating value.

That won’t happen on its own. It will require new policies promoting investment and restructuring of the marketplace. We must all work to create a new energy ecosystem, not just new technologies to capture emissions, but to also produce lower-carbon fuels and products that can be differentiated and compete globally. It is not about choosing the “right” technology or product, but about incorporating all forms of fuels and technologies for both renewable and hydrocarbon-based energy while also lowering emissions.

On HoustonChronicle.com: Giant sucking sound: Technology removes carbon from atmosphere

Texas must embrace this immense opportunity to leverage our universities, energy companies and marketplace to take advantage of our world-leading energy infrastructure. If we get it right, we can become a playbook for the rest of the world. We can walk the talk here and accelerate the transformation that will benefit everyone.

There is no more important global challenge, no more important time and no more important place than Houston. Real sustainability requires meeting the growing global demand for energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions significantly, as well as assuring energy is affordable and reliable for all. Houston and Texas must become the Sustainable Energy Capital of the World.

Phoenix tied its record for the longest stretch of time where temperatures never fell below 90 degrees last week. The temperature was 90 or above for seven straight days, even at night, an indicator of the impact of the urban heat island effect in combination with an increasingly warming world.

“We expect to have episodes of extreme heat here every summer just based on our position on the map,” said David Hondula, an Arizona State University scientist who studies heat and health. “But we are seeing over time an intensification of those heat events, we’re seeing a lengthening of the summer season, and we’re especially seeing a rise in nighttime temperatures.”

In a highly urban desert setting like Phoenix, heat that accumulates during the day doesn’t dissipate as quickly at night, keeping temperatures hot in the city throughout the night.

“Open scrub desert is pretty good at radiating heat away at nighttime, but the buildings, the concrete, all the stuff around us, retains that energy and releases it more slowly,” said Paul Iñiguez, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. “You can only release so much energy in a finite number of hours, during nighttime, and when you start the day at 90 degrees you don't have that much further to warm up.”

Outlying towns and areas of open desert that are the same elevation as Phoenix can be 10 to 15 degrees cooler than the metro area at night, Iñiguez said. The National Weather Service maintains temperature records that go back as far as August 1895. Since the 1980s, high nighttime temperatures have starkly increased.

WHERE'S THE RAIN? After 99 days without rain, Phoenix could see monsoon storms

Between July 7 and July 15, temperatures never fell below 90 degrees and had highs in the 110s.

From 1895 through the 1970s, Phoenix had only 9 days total where overnight lows were 90 degrees or above, Iñiguez said. Since 1980, that number has shot up to 227 days where temperatures didn’t fall below 90 during the summer months.

“That's the big eye-catching thing, the fact that we get these 90s lows more overall now,” Iñiguez said. “We certainly have this shift towards warmer temperatures overall, but this rate of warming is much more drastic at night.”

Overnight temperatures are increasing at twice the rate as afternoon temperatures, according to NWS data analyzed by Iñiguez. In 2003 and 2013, Phoenix hit its record for number of days where the temperature didn’t fall below 90 in a year: 15 days total. Already, there have been 11 days this year where temperatures never dropped below 90.

The last time there were 7 days in a row where low temperatures never fell below 90 was in August of 2012.

Global heating and urbanization are the main contributing factors to this heat trend.

“We see the effect of global scale climate change both in our daytime temperatures and our nighttime temperatures,” said Hondula. “But really the dominant driver here in Phoenix and many other cities in the past five, six, seven, eight decades is from urbanization and the effect of urbanization is clearest in those nighttime temperature records.”

The Southwest, already the hottest and driest region in the United States, is warming at a faster rate than other parts of the country, largely because of global heating caused by human-driven greenhouse gas emissions. This gradual climate change means longer, hotter summers, experts say, as the monsoon pattern arrives later.

The urban heat island effect only intensifies that warming. During the day, the boundary layer, or the layer of air in the atmosphere closest to the ground, heats up. As the sun heats the air near the ground, that hot air warms up and rises into the boundary layer. In Phoenix during the summer, that boundary layer can become several miles thick.

It requires a tremendous amount of energy and an unusually intense combination of high pressure and dry air to get to those record temperatures, which is why Phoenix doesn’t regularly break heat records, Iñiguez said. The all-time record high for Phoenix remains 122 degrees on June 26, 1990.

“Every year is not necessarily hotter than the past year, but the trend is very unmistakable that it's going up,” Iñiguez said. “You're having more of these 90 degree lows, you're having more 100 degree days, more 110 degree days, so it's this really broad warming of the system and then holding on to that overnight.”

Those high temperatures have serious public health impacts. That week, the burn unit at Valleywise Health saw a spike in cases.

“We expect some every year but, man, our numbers this year are just high,” said Kevin Foster, head of the Arizona Burn Center in Phoenix. “We’ve had a few people that have laid outside so long they ended up with heat-induced brain damage and passed away. It’s just terrible.”

Most of Foster’s clients are older adults and children. About 20 percent of the people who come through the unit are homeless, he said.

“With these hot sunny days, the pavement temperature can get up to 180 degrees,” Foster said. “We’ve seen a number of kids who have tried to dash across the driveway, elderly people may fall down and can’t get up. All it takes is less than a minute on pavement or black top and you get a bad burn. Almost all of these contact burns end up being third degree and almost all of them have to get into surgery and get a skin graft.”

People experiencing homelessness and drug abuse are particularly at risk, especially as the COVID-19 pandemic has forced libraries, fast food restaurants, and many cooling stations to close—spaces that people living on the street rely on to cool down.

The number of facilities participating in Maricopa County’s heat relief network is down some 75 percent because of the pandemic, said Hondula.

“It’s a huge reduction, which is one of the many reasons we’re extra concerned about heat this summer,” he said. “Many buildings remain closed, and those buildings, whether it’s a community center, senior center, are often filling this role as cooling centers. Our capacity to provide relief through that mechanism has taken a big hit.”

Earlier this month, Maricopa County opened one of its vacant downtown Phoenix buildings for up to 130 people experiencing homelessness to sleep overnight during the heat of the summer.

“It’s just really hard on the body to have nighttime temperatures that hot when you’re trying to sleep,” said Nancy Selover, the state climatologist. “It gets very difficult to sleep and very difficult to get relief for the body.”

The concerns are only growing as the onset of the monsoon gets nearer.

“It seems like we might be turning a corner to our monsoon, which of course is going to bring some thunderstorm activity and the potential for localized power outages,” said Hondula. “We’re very concerned what our heat death and illness numbers are going to look like this summer with so many other challenges happening in the world. Unfortunately it just seems like the deck is really stacked against us with the pandemic.”

Tips to Avoid Heat-Related Illness

§ Increase fluid intake regardless of activity level. Staying hydrated is extremely important.

§ Limit exercise or outdoor activity between the hours of 11am and 3pm.

§ When outdoors, wear a sunscreen with a minimum SPF 15 and re-apply often. Wear a hat, lightweight clothing and sunglasses.

§ Rest frequently in shady or cool areas to give the body's temperature a chance to recover and cool down.

§ Never leave adults, children or pets inside a parked vehicle.

§ Respectfully check on elderly neighbors to make sure their air conditioning is working and in use.

How you can help

§ Donations of snacks, sun protection aids like hats, sunscreen, sunglasses, light-weight clothing, and bottled water are needed. Visit the MAG Heat Relief Network Interactive Map to search for a donation collection site near you.

§ Educate your friends and neighbors about the dangers of extreme heat.

§ Have water bottles available in your car for emergencies.

It’s no fun. But at Phoenix New Times, we feel it’s important to keep our readers up to date on ways to continue supporting the restaurants and bars that make this metropolitan area so wonderful. This week, we’re launching a new resource aimed at making that much easier.

Grab-and-go dinners from Phoenix City Grille. Phoenix City Grille

It’s called the Phoenix Restaurant Directory.

There, you can search for a restaurant by name, neighborhood, or cuisine type and review the eatery’s guidelines for takeout, delivery, and dine-in. That includes health and safety measures being taken at each location — for both guests and employees.

We’re trying to connect establishments with patrons based on comfort level. Fine with dine-in? Select that option. Looking to stay home? Click takeout or delivery.

The directory will be regularly updated. But restaurants, breweries, and coffee shops can also submit their business information and update their listings. So if you own a restaurant, and you just reopened your dining room (or returned to takeout only, or are closing on Mondays for the foreseeable future, or whatever) you can update the listing yourself.

If you see something that needs to be changed, send us a message by clicking the flag on the restaurant’s information page next to “Options change frequently, so best to call the restaurant to confirm. Did we get something wrong? Please message us.”

Chefs, restaurant owners, general managers, and those in public relations: Whenever you get a minute, please try out the directory. See if your business is listed and use the restaurant submission form to add your establishment or make updates.

The city of Phoenix has $15 million in free money for businesses and can't give it away

If you own a small business in Phoenix – maybe you’re a one-person operation or you have a dozen or two employees -- you may be hearing soon from city hall.

The call may go something like this: “Hi, we’re here from the government and we’re here to help.”

While normally that’s a phone call likely to send you scurrying under the bed, don’t hang up.

It seems the city of Phoenix has roughly $15 million in free money, ready to give away, but can’t find anyone to take it.

That’s astonishing.

So astonishing, in fact, that city employees are actually calling businesses to let them know the money is available.

“This money will do more good in the hands of these small business owners than it will in the city’s coffers,” Gretchen Wolfe, procurement manager for the city’s Community and Economic Development department, told me. “So we definitely want to award this money so people can continue their businesses, keeping the economy going and paying their bills.”

The Phoenix City Council in May set aside roughly $19 million of its nearly $300 million federal CARES Act allotment to assist small and micro businesses struggling to stay afloat since COVID-19 slammed into the state.

The money is just sitting there

Some of the money was immediately snapped up. The bulk of it, though, is just sitting there, which is crazy when you think of how many small businesses are struggling just to get through the month.

Wolfe figures many one- or two-person operations probably don’t know about the available help while other small business owners may worry that it could interfere with their Paycheck Protection Program loans. (Wolfe says it won’t, as long as the money is spent on legitimate business expenses not already covered by PPP funds.)

Business owners who have obtained the city grants tell me it’s helped them through rough times they never could have imagined.

People like Veronica Manriquez, who owns Clamatos La Cruda, a restaurant near 32nd Street and Thomas. Manriquez got a $10,000 check from the city just a few days ago.

“Paying the rent is going to be the first thing and I’m a little bit behind with two of my loyal employees,” she said.

People like Mabel Tsosie, who owns Spottedhorse Infosystems LLC. Tsosie works out of her own home, offering computer, business support and consulting services. Her $3,000 micro business grant allowed her to buy new equipment to boost her computing power as she looks for ways to replace lost business.

“Everything is so uncertain right now,” she said. “It’s scary and being the smallest of the small business, you’re just that much more scared. It (the grant) helped me feel more empowered by just having more powerful tools. You feel like you’re ready to figure out what’s out there with the next pivot.”

People like Chris Windsor, whose company, LRW Cutting Tools, manufactures tools used in the aerospace industry. Windsor and his father, Richard, got a PPP loan to cover payroll for their 15 employees but had nothing left over to pay suppliers when business vanished in March. The city’s $10,000 grant bridged the gap until business started slowly returning.

“It was certainly helpful in making sure we were meeting our obligations,” he said.

People like Joe Seriale, who owns Joe’s Diner in the city’s Melrose District.

He saw an 88% drop in sales as a result of COVID-19. His PPP loan covered payroll for 13 employees but that money’s gone now. The $10,000 city grant allowed him to continue paying his employees along with rent and utilities.

“Damn right, it helped,"" he said. ""It gave me at least a month of breath and if I can stretch it out, a month and a half. You’re damn straight it helped. It was lifesaving. All I’m doing now is rebuilding my business like I did when I started.”

Rebuilding. There’s a lot of that going on now by people who are the backbone of Phoenix.

They don’t get the sweetheart deals. They don’t hire lobbyists or have family or banking connections to make sure they’re first in line to scoop the goodies being doled out in Washington D.C.

They’re just hard working people trying to hang on.

If you’re one of them, I figure you should know that the city is offering at least some glue to try to hold things together.

Does your business qualify?

If you own employ up to 24 people in Phoenix, were in business on Jan 1. 2019 and saw a 25% drop in year-over-year sales in either March or April 2020, here’s what the city can do for you:

-Small Business Relief Grant. These grants, ranging from $3,000 to $10,000, are available to companies that employ six to 24 people, had gross sales of up to $3 million in 2019 and are located in or near a low-income neighborhood as defined by 2010 Census. (Downtown Phoenix counts, as do portions of Midtown and even the edges of Arcadia. To see if your business qualifies, check out the map at the Arizona Community Foundation, which is screening applications for the city’s grant program.)

Of the $5 million the city has allocated for small business relief, $4 million is still available. That’s enough to help anywhere from 400 to 1,300 businesses.

-Micro Business Resiliency Grant. These grants of $3,000 and $5,000 are available to those who work for themselves or employ up to five people in a business with gross sales of up to $1 million. This includes everything from home-based businesses to Uber and DoorDash drivers to food truck operators.

More than $6 million of the $8.25 million allocated to this program is just sitting there, waiting for people to claim it. That’s enough to help at least 2,000 businesses.

- Commercial City Services Bill Relief. The city has set aside $5 million to help cover water and sewer bills for commercial operations. There also is residential relief available for home-based businesses. Wolfe says hardly anybody has even asked about it.

For more information on what's available, check out phoenix.gov/resources or call the city’s hotline at 602-262-5040.

The city is trying to give away this money. And maybe along with it just a little of peace of mind.

“I went to sleep that night that I finally got it,” Seriale told me. “And that was a long time coming.”

https://www.abc15.com/sports/phoenix-city-council-approves-230-million-for-talking-stick-resort-arena-renovation,Phoenix,Phoenix City Council approves $230 million for Talking Stick Resort Arena renovation,"The Phoenix City Council approved $230 million in spending for the renovation of Talking Stick Resort Arena -- home of the Phoenix Suns, Phoenix Mercury, Arizona Rattlers and numerous concerts and other live events -- in a scheduled meeting Wednesday.

The arena will undergo renovations between 2019 and 2021. The City of Phoenix will contribute $150 million toward the renovation, and the Suns will contribute $80 million.

The measure was approved by a 6-2 margin just before 6 p.m. Wednesday after over three hours of discussion by city council members, residents and business leaders who favored and opposed the renovations. Vice Mayor Jim Waring and Councilman Sal DiCiccio voted against the measure.

The city will fund its portion of the renovations through its Sports Facilities Fund, generated by existing tourism-related excise taxes -- specifically, a 1 percent hotel tax and a 2 percent rental car tax. Any spending beyond $230 million will be funded by the Suns.

Renovations will include repair and replacement of mechanical, electrical and plumbing infrastructure for the arena, which the Suns have called home since the 1992-93 NBA season.

Per the agreement, the Suns will build an off-site practice facility in Phoenix, at an estimated cost of $25-$50 million, in order to free up space at Talking Stick Resort Arena. The Suns will be required to pay for that facility.

The city council added an amendment introduced by Councilwoman Vania Guevara on Wednesday in which the Suns will commit at least $10 million toward community endeavors, including $2.6 toward the city's Head Start preschool program. Suns owner Robert Sarver, who attended Wednesday's meeting, expressed his support for the amendment.

The Phoenix City Council was originally scheduled to vote on the renovation project Dec. 12, but the vote was pushed back amid growing concern about the cost and sources of funding for those renovations. The city held a series of open forums in the last month to allow citizens to discuss the project before it was put to a vote.

Previously, the Suns' arena contract with the city ran through 2032, but the team could have opted out as soon as 2022 if certain criteria were met. With Wednesday's vote, that contract has been extended until 2037, with an option to extend it to 2042.

The city anticipates collecting additional fees and rent from the Suns as a result of the proposed renovation -- an estimated $60 million over the term of the agreement. The Suns and the city will both make annual contributions to a Renewal and Replacement Account to ensure the arena's infrastructure remains intact throughout the lifetime of the contract. Phoenix will contribute $2 million annually (up to $25 million total) from its Sports Facilities Fund, and the Suns will contribute $1 million annually (up to $12.5 million total).

The Phoenix Arena Development Limited Partnership will continue to pay all operations, event and maintenance expenses for the arena. The Suns agree to pay up to $200 million to the city if they relocate out of Phoenix before the end of the amended contract in 2037.

Sarver has been adamant that Talking Stick Resort Arena is in dire need of renovations -- but in December, he assured fans that the Suns will not leave Phoenix, despite a report that he could seek to relocate the team if the renovation measure was rejected.

Here's a breakdown of estimated renovation costs: (Go here for more details)

$99.58 million: Maintenance for mechanical, electrical, plumbing and communication systems. This includes brand-new pipe, fittings, insulation, valves and instrumentation, upgraded digital control systems, a new LED lighting system, a replacement of outdated communication systems, new plumbing fixtures, new sewer lines and new rainwater drain systems. The city says it would fund the majority of these expenses.

$26.37 million: Replacements for worn-out and non-working furniture, fixtures and equipment throughout the arena, along with new arena artwork, and repairs to food service areas and food service equipment for over 30 arena concession stands.

$18.65 million: Technology and security upgrades, including CCTV security system upgrades and a new multi-function video board, ribbon board and digital control room.

$17.63 million: Enhancements to the exterior wall and building envelope that will, in the city's words, ""improve building efficiency and enhance the architecture and streetscape appeal of the facility.""

$14.81 million: Improvements to lower- and upper-level seating areas, including resurfacing and recoating of stairs and platforms, replacement of damaged seats, new hallways and entrances to seating sections, and a widening of the concourse in the corners of the arena in order to provide views of the event floor.

$13.17 million: Improvements to locker rooms, VIP and premium spaces, and repurposing of the current practice courts in order to free up space for storage and circulation.

$11.67 million: New and repaired elevators and escalators throughout the arena.

$9.8 million: Main concourse improvements, including an expansion of the concourse to create more space, more concession stands, and improved circulation in order to make loading and unloading easier.

$7.21 million: Improvements to Lower Suite Level A, which includes club upgrades, improved circulation and back-of-house spaces. The Suns would pay for these improvements.

$5.01 million: Roof and structural upgrades.

$4.88 million: Improvements to the upper concourse, including widening of the concourse in order to improve circulation, which will improve access to seating, concession stands and restrooms. Also, new concession stands and storage improvements in the upper concourse.

$4.21 million: Improvements to Upper Suite Level B, including access, storage and circulation enhancements. The Suns would pay for these improvements.

$1.91 million: New signage and graphics, including ""enhanced wayfinding, advertising, and other patron communications improvements throughout the arena.""

Employees working minimum-wage jobs for the city of Phoenix soon can expect to make more than their counterparts outside the city.

The Phoenix City Council voted Wednesday to increase the city employee minimum wage to $15 per hour, $4 more than the current state minimum wage.

The increase was approved unanimously.

According to the city, about 150 full-time employees make less than $15 per hour. Increasing their pay to the new minimum will cost the city about $525,000 annually.

""It's going to make a big difference, a difference for their families,"" Councilman Michael Nowakowski said.

Examples of city positions that currently make less than $15 per hour include security guards, library clerks, police records clerks, youth counselors, police aides, solid-waste workers and groundskeepers.

Jennifer Grondahl, who represents the Laborers' International Union of North America Local 777 union, thanked the city for the increase.

""That's going to change people's lives,"" Grondahl said.

State minimum wage to increase, too

In 2016, state voters approved Proposition 206, which began a series of stepped increases of the state's minimum wage.

That proposition boosted the state's minimum to $10 in 2017 from $8.05 an hour in 2016, followed by an increase to $10.50 in 2018 and $11 in 2019. The fourth hike will take the minimum wage to $12 an hour in 2020.

The Arizona Legislature is considering a bill that would allow employers to pay student workers less than the state-mandated minimum wage.

Councilwoman Vania Guevara said that while the state is looking to peel away wage protections, she was proud that Phoenix was moving in the opposite direction.

""It's really great to see Phoenix lead by example,"" Guevara said.

https://ktar.com/story/2695743/city-of-phoenix-announces-3-updates-to-police-department-policy/,Phoenix,City of Phoenix announces 3 updates to police department policy,"PHOENIX — The city of Phoenix on Monday announced three updates to its police department’s policies concerning body cameras, mental health training and data recording.

Mayor Kate Gallego said at a press conference that all officers on patrol are now equipped with body cameras, putting the city ahead of schedule in its camera rollout.

More than 1,700 cameras have been issued so far, she said, and they will now be given to other officers, including SWAT teams and and transit officers.

The police department will also now extend its eight-hour mental health crisis intervention training program to all officers, not just recruits.

Gallego said 194 new recruits have completed the training so far, and all patrol officers will complete it within the next two years.

Erica Chestnut-Ramirez, director of crisis and trauma healing services at La Frontera, helped develop the training.

“It’s extremely important for law enforcement to have a basic training to help them identify whether it’s a mental health or a substance use issue so that they can get the person to the services that they need rather than just incarcerating them,” she said.

Phoenix Police Chief Jeri Williams said the training will help officers “put empathy first” when responding to calls.

In addition, as of Aug. 5, officers must now track every time a weapon is pointed at a person.

Wiliams said the new data collection will give the department “a real idea of how many times our officers are able to successfully de-escalate an incident and a situation with the potential of deadly force.”

Carole Coles Henry, the former co-chair of the city’s Community and Police Trust Initiative, said police can use the data to identify trends.

“Take a look at the demographics of the subject, the demographics of the officer, but more importantly, take a look at if a gun was utilized, whether or not there was an opportunity for de-escalation and/or an opportunity for using some other tactic,” she said.

All three policy updates stemmed from recommendations made by the National Police Foundation in a report meant to strengthen the relationship between police and the community.

The city commissioned the report after it recorded a record high number of officer-involved shootings in 2018.

https://ktar.com/story/2620999/phoenix-city-council-approves-police-budget-despite-heavy-protests/,Phoenix,Phoenix City Council approves police budget despite heavy protests,"PHOENIX — Phoenix City Council on Wednesday voted to pass a $721 million police budget despite heavy protests asking for reform of a department mired in controversy.

The budget was approved during a city council meeting in a 7-2 vote. Councilmen Sal DiCiccio and Jim Waring voted against the budget.

The vote came after several hours of citizens lobbying against the department in public comment, asking for the officers involved in the May 27 incident centered around excessive force to be fired before passing the budget.

Those in attendance who were against the passing of the budget booed and left City Hall following the vote.

The council meeting was just the latest opportunity for protesters to express their displeasure with the Phoenix Police Department.

Two incidents in the last month, including the shoplifting incident involving Dravon Ames, Iesha Harper and their two children, have ignited a series of meetings aimed at reforming the department.

Rev. Jarrett Maupin, an adviser for the family in the viral video of a disturbing confrontation with Phoenix police, made a formal request Wednesday at City Hall to have two officers involved fired.

Joined by Ames and Harper and a group of their family members, Maupin submitted a citizen petition during the public comment session of a regularly scheduled City Council meeting.

Ames, 22, told councilmembers that he and his family “could have lost their lives over something senseless … over a 4-year-old taking a doll.”

He said it is “sad” the officers are still employed.

Ames added, “I guess our lives are worth less than a 99-cent doll.”

The new protest followed a Tuesday night meeting that drew hundreds of people to a downtown church to address the videos, which were taken by bystanders who watched police confront Ames and Harper, his pregnant fiancee, who was holding her 1-year-old daughter. The couple say their 4-year-old daughter took a doll from a store without their knowledge.

The store decided not to prosecute, and no charges have been filed.

The couple filed a $10 million notice of claim, a precursor to a lawsuit, against the city alleging civil rights violations.

The Phoenix Police Department has said an investigation into the officers’ actions is underway.

THE MEDIA: Web

WHO SAID IT: Responsible Budgets, a political campaign supporting Proposition 106

THE COMMENT: “Every Phoenix family owes $13,290 in unfunded pensions.”

THE FORUM: The Responsible Budgets campaign website

WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT: Does every household in Phoenix owe $13,290 in pension debt?

OUR RATING: No stars: False

ANALYSIS: Phoenix will hold a special election on Aug. 27 to decide two major issues.

Proposition 105 would end the expansion of light rail while Proposition 106 aims to limit city spending until pension debt is significantly reduced.

The campaign in support of Prop 106, Responsible Budgets, brings awareness to underfunded public pensions. Phoenix has more than $4 billion in unfunded pension debt. That means the city doesn't have the assets to cover the full cost of benefits it owes to its retirees.

The City of Phoenix Employees’ Retirement System (COPERS) manages retirement benefits for city employees. The city's police and fire departments receive retirement benefits through a state-run system called the Public Safety Personnel Retirement System (PSPRS).

COPERS' pensions make up 36% of Phoenix's unfunded pension debt, while police and fire make up about 64%.

Last year, Phoenix spent $376 million on city employees' pension benefits. This year, the city plans to spend $426 million.

Passage of Prop. 106 would require the city to put any excess funding toward pension debt, end pensions for city council members, create annual pension debt assessments and prevent new city spending if pensions are not 90% funded.

As part of the campaign for Prop. 106, Responsible Budgets has circulated figures about what the pension debt means for Phoenix taxpayers.

On their website, the group claims, “Every Phoenix family owes $13,290 in unfunded pensions.” It's not clear how the group arrived at that figure.

According to the City of Phoenix's Comprehensive Annual Financial Report published in June 2018, the city's net pension liability is $4.56 billion.

And according to Census data from July 2018, Phoenix has 544,022 households. Dividing those two numbers puts the city’s pension debt at about $8,730 per family.

A spokeswoman for Responsible Budgets, Merissa Hamilton, told AZ Fact Check in an email that the $13,290 figure comes from “the $5.7B unfunded pension liability divided by the number of households in Phoenix.”

The group did not provide a source for the $5.7 billion figure. But even when using this number, the cost per family comes to about $10,730, almost $3,000 less than the amount Responsible Budgets cited.

Hamilton said because there were fewer households in Phoenix at the time Responsible Budgets began their campaign, the math in the past did work out to around $13,000. She did not clarify when the group began working on the Prop 106 initiative.

As the money for pension funds comes through tax collection, it’s important to note that every family in the city of Phoenix is not obligated to pay a certain amount of pension debt. Rather, taxpayers foot the bill through taxes they already pay to the city, mainly in the form of sales tax.

Also, dividing the city's pension debt by the number of households in Phoenix makes the price tag Responsible Budgets provides significantly greater. If the debt was divided by the actual population, the individual burden would be a fourth of what the group claims, or about $3,000.

Phoenix spokesman Matthew Heil likens the city’s current pension payment plan to paying off a mortgage on a house.

“Just like a mortgage, the cost is not paid in full up front but is spread over many years to be manageable. State law allows the city to do this, and we have always paid 100% of the required contribution,” Heil said.

That doesn't mean the debt isn't creating escalating consequences, though. A state law enacted in 2018 requires the city to publish their plan for funding the pension deficit every year.

In a city council report from March outlining Phoenix's pension funding objectives, the city acknowledges, “Increases in net pension liabilities and annual pension costs have placed significant budgetary constraints on the City's ability to provide employee wage and non-pension benefit increases.... While currently manageable, this pressure will continue into the foreseeable future.”

Heil notes the city already has taken steps to help pay off the money it owes to its retirees.

“The city has, through referendum and administrative action, already implemented pension reforms, which have improved the city’s ability to meet its obligations and will continue to look for further reforms,” Heil said.

Still, Phoenix's pension debt is growing, and so are concerns about funding it long-term.

BOTTOM LINE: Regardless of what portion of Phoenix’s pension debt each family accounts for when the debt pool is divided among them, every family is not liable for a certain amount of the total. Rather, taxpayer dollars fund the city’s pension liability. Also, the numbers Responsible Budgets uses to justify their claim are inaccurate.

https://chamberbusinessnews.com/2019/09/06/city-of-phoenix-to-pilot-new-water-conservation-technology-at-asu-west-campus/,Phoenix,City of Phoenix to pilot new water conservation technology at ASU West campus,"The City of Phoenix recently announced its Water Services Department received a grant to pilot a program testing innovative water conservation technology in partnership with Arizona State University.

The funds will be used to inject water-absorbing polymers, also known as hydrogels, under the turf of 12 acres of soccer fields on the ASU West campus.

“This is technology that is currently being used in California,” said Kathryn Sorensen, Phoenix Water director. “The City of Phoenix applied for a grant with the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, in partnership with Arizona State University, and received a $100,000 grant to pilot this same technology here in our desert soils to see how well it works out for us.”

The hydrogels are injected beneath the roots of grass turf, creating a barrier that can absorb water while slowly releasing it over time, similar to a sponge, Sorensen said.

“The idea is that it will reduce the amount of water that is necessary to keep the turf healthy,” she said.

According to the City of Phoenix, testing in California showed that hydrogels can reduce lawn water usage by 40 to 45 percent.

“We’re always looking for ways to innovate when it comes to water conservation,” Sorensen said. “As we look to a future that’s hotter and drier, it’s really, really important that we continue to do everything we can and really push the boundaries on water conservation as an adaptation measure.”

The pilot program will look to see if hydrogels can retain enough water to keep the soccer fields at ASU West healthy while using less irrigation.

“The soccer fields currently use about 11 million gallons of water [per year], and we’re hoping through the pilot to demonstrate about a 40 percent reduction in the amount of water used,” Sorensen said.

A 40 percent reduction in water usage on the 12 acres being tested would mean using 4.4 million fewer gallons of water per year, saving ASU and the city approximately $25,400 per year, according to the City of Phoenix.

About 60 percent of water consumed in the Southwest goes to exterior landscaping. The hydrogels can absorb up to 400 percent of their weight in water and release up to 96 percent of the water into the turf, retaining the ability to absorb and release water over a period of 5 to 7 years, according to the City of Phoenix.

“We are eager to see if this project produces similar or better conservation results in our climate and soil as compared to California,” said JoEllen Alberhasky, program manager for sustainability practices at ASU. “If so, it will become another valuable tool in addressing the ongoing drought in Arizona.”

If the program is successful, Sorensen said the City of Phoenix will likely expand the use of hydrogels to more of its turf facilities, including city parks and municipal golf courses. The city would also try to make the technology available to private golf courses, sports facilities and, eventually, even homeowners.

“Whether we would just encourage other, private individuals to use it or offer an incentive is, at this point, unknown,” she said. “It’s just too early to know yet.”

But one thing is certain: If hydrogels lead to healthy, green grass while using less water, they are a win for Arizona.

“We know that the flows of the Colorado River are going to diminish over time and that the river is already over-allocated,” Sorensen said.

Looking to the future, she said, Arizonans need to continue to innovate and create new ways to save water.

“[We must] use our water wisely so that we can continue to provide the quality of life that we have here in the Valley of the Sun,” she said.",['Subsistence - Physiology']

The City of Phoenix Housing Department, along with co-developer Gorman & Co., has begun work on Monroe Gardens Apartments, a 78-unit affordable housing project in the city’s Sky Harbor submarket. The development will replace the old A.L. Krohn East public housing community, built about 60 years ago.

Rents in Arizona’s capital have been soaring, putting more pressure on low-income residents. According to Yardi Matrix data, rent gains were up 6.1 percent year-over-year through September, placing Phoenix on the second spot among the country’s major metros for rent growth.

Located at 1441 E. Monroe St., the new Monroe Gardens Apartments will turn 38 units of obsolete public housing into energy-efficient apartments. The new community is set to consist of five buildings with one- to five-bedroom units. Amenities are slated to include a new playground and community space. The project is being built through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Rental Assistance Demonstration program that allows residents to spend 30 percent of their income on rent.

According to Fox 10 Phoenix, the redevelopment of the site is being funded through a portion of a $30 million U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development grant for the modernization of the entire Edison-Eastlake neighborhood. Furthermore, Arizona’s Department of Housing is providing federal tax credits. Completion of the new property is scheduled for late 2020.","['Subsistence - Living Space', 'Creation - Affordability']"

The latest craze in alternative transportation programs, the dockless electric scooter, may zoom into downtown Phoenix by the spring.

While the scooters are already well-established in other cities across the Valley and nation, a Phoenix city ordinance has so far kept the vehicles out of downtown.

""As we think about multi-modal transportation, many U.S. cities are looking toward electric scooters as a new transportation option and possible alternative to cars,"" assistant director of the Phoenix Street Transportation Department Briiana Velez said at a recent city subcommittee meeting.

The City Council approved a dockless bike program this past summer, but Velez said the industry had already moved toward electric scooters.

A scooter pilot program, which the Aviation and Transportation Subcommittee approved Tuesday, would require the City Council to adjust the ordinance and allow electric scooter vendors to start operations downtown as soon as March.

Greasing the wheels for scooters downtown

The Phoenix Street Transportation Department staff has recommended a six to 12-month pilot program to evaluate the impact and value of scooters downtown.

The boundaries for docking the scooters would be McDowell Road to Buckeye Road and Seventh Avenue to Seventh Street , but the scooters could be ridden outside of those boundaries. Scooter vendors would be required to collect the scooters at night to charge and return to docking locations in the morning.

Devney Preuss , executive director for the Phoenix Community Alliance, which has worked with the city to develop the proposed program, said the boundaries represent the redevelopment area in downtown Phoenix.

""It is the commercial, urban center of Phoenix,"" Preuss said. ""Anything beyond the boundaries starts to become residential, so we hope to have a relationship with the communities there to have an open dialogue about why the scooters are not in their neighborhoods and why they shouldn't be.""

Riders in the pilot program will need to be at least 18 years old and have a valid driver's license. The scooters will be prohibited on sidewalks and must be ridden on the street or in bike lanes at a maximum speed of 15 MPH.

Staff has proposed various kinds of fees to cover the cost of the program, including a $500 vendor application fee and $80 relocation fee, which would apply if city staff has to move a scooter back into the designated area.

Stipulations would include:

Each vendor could have a maximum of 300 scooters.

Each vendor could have four scooters per staging location.

A 100-foot distance between staging locations.

Scooters must adhere to the latest safety and durability standards and include front and back lights.

Vendors must submit to the city details on how it will teach customers how to safely ride and park a scooter.

Vendors must encourage the use of helmets and encourage riders to use lower-traffic streets.

Throughout the pilot program, officials will evaluate and collect data on ridership trends, incidents, community feedback and rider surveys and compliance.

Kini Knudson, director of City of Phoenix Street Transportation Department, said his department has been closely monitoring other cities that have already implemented similar programs.

“We know there have been some success stories and some that were not so successful,"" Knudson said. ""We wanted to have an opportunity to draw some boundaries around our program and see how it would work in an area like downtown where you have a definite demand.”

Moving forward despite safety concerns

After the presentation, Councilwoman Felicita Mendoza asked Velez and Knudson to address safety concerns including policies in the instance of inebriated scooter drivers and who would be at fault in the case of an accident.

Velez said the ordinance changes necessary to implement the program would allow the police department to issue civil traffic violations and apply traffic laws to scooter riders.

Scooter rider deaths have been documented in cities across the nation and Tempe Assistant Fire Chief Andrea Glass has told The Arizona Republic the Tempe Fire Department responded to 119 scooter-related incidents that resulted in injuries between June and December.

Even without the scooters, Arizona cities have significant numbers of pedestrian deaths. Data from the Governors Highway Safety Association released in 2017 indicated Arizona has the highest number of pedestrian deaths per population in the nation. Data released in 2018 showed pedestrian deaths in Arizona rose five percent from 2017 to 2018.

“Safety has been a big issue and I know … it will be something we focus in on as we monitor and evaluate the metrics of the program,"" Councilwoman Debra Stark said.

Mendoza recommended the city revisit the program after 90 days for evaluation. With this amendment, staff recommended the pilot program for approval.

Preparing to kick off

To begin the pilot program, the City Council will need to approve the associated fees and amend the ordinance currently keeping electric scooters out of downtown.

The council is scheduled to hear the proposal at the March 20 meeting.

Knudson said ordinances typically have a 30-day wait period before they go into effect, so staff will revisit the program 90 days after the first permit is issued.

Preuss said the increasing connectivity of people who live, work and play in downtown Phoenix heightens the need for increasing modes of alternative transportation.

""People no longer want to move in and out of the city quickly after they get off work,"" she said. ""We now have amenities that people want to experience, which the scooters can increase their access to.""

Downtown Phoenix is the optimal location for this program because it is the walkable, urban epicenter of the city, Preuss said.

""These scooter companies wanted to be in Phoenix yesterday, but they understand the need to address all of the concerns and work with the city so they can be as successful as possible when they enter the market,"" she said.

Arizona State University officials did not immediately respond to questions about whether it would ban the scooters on its downtown campus. It has banned scooters on the Tempe campus.

The newest pedestrian safety initiative from the city of Phoenix includes a partnership with ASU's Design Studio for Community Solutions within the Watts College of Public Service and Community Solutions.

The partnership with ASU, which would include a research grant of up to $50,000, has yet to be approved by the Phoenix City Council, but the plan passed through the City of Phoenix Transportation, Infrastructure and Innovation subcommittee during a committee meeting on Oct. 2.

The subcommittee plans to recommend the proposal to Phoenix City Council for final approval.

“We’re tackling pedestrian safety in several different ways and ASU has always been our partner in all these projects,” Councilmember Thelda Williams said. “I’m very hopeful it’s going to help reduce incidents.”

Julian Paras, a senior studying journalism, got hit by a truck while crossing the street outside the Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication the day before his freshman year of college.

""I went to a job fair with a buddy of mine and when we were heading back to our dorms, we were crossing the street with the right of way, and out of nowhere I see this truck coming at me and just like that I felt like I saw life flash before my eyes,"" Paras said. ""I managed to jump away but still got hit pretty good and flew some 10 feet.""

Paras said he broke his right fibula but did not need surgery and was able to recover after a four-month period of using a wheelchair, crutches and a cane.

""Ultimately I should have been more aware of where I was,"" he said. ""Being a freshman in college, I was so excited about everything around me that I lost track of my surroundings.""

Paras said pedestrians are not able to take any precautionary measures other than looking both ways before crossing the road, leaving drivers to take responsibility for pedestrian safety.

“Perhaps the best way to implement changes are harsher laws against pedestrians who don’t obey the laws themselves, like jaywalking for example,"" Paras said. ""However, it should be the same for drivers. If there are laws that help drivers stay in line, that lowers the risk of a person being badly injured or even worse.”

Phoenix City Council approved $2 million for pedestrian safety in June. The newest spending proposal from the Street Transportation Department and the Office of Pedestrian Safety allocates that money for specific areas of improvement.

“Obviously the city is growing very rapidly and we want to ensure that the kinds of signals and infrastructure and education that we do as a city is focused on pedestrian safety,” said Heather Murphy, the Communications and Public Engagement representative for the Street Transportation Department.

The decision to approve the proposal comes after mounting pressure from Phoenix residents.

According to a report from the Arizona Department of Transportation, last year there were 245 pedestrians killed throughout Arizona’s 15 counties, with 166 of these in Maricopa County.

An investigation published by the Arizona Republic in April also revealed abnormally high rates of pedestrian deaths and a history of inaction from the city of Phoenix. According to the article, the city of Phoenix failed to install crosswalks in locations with high fatality rates within the past five years.

Weeks after the Arizona Republic published its findings, the Phoenix City Council rejected a proposed pedestrian safety plan. Vision Zero, a national non-profit pedestrian safety project, failed with a 4-4 vote.

The newest proposal focuses the majority of funding on building crosswalks, medians and streetlights.

This includes $600,000 for high intensity activated crosswalks (HAWK) and another $660,000 for crosswalk upgrades, including pedestrian warning signs and installation of access ramps.

The proposal also includes the new partnership between the Street Transportation Department and the Design Studio for Community Solutions.

The partnership hopes to analyze the different factors that lead to pedestrian deaths and make changes accordingly through a proposed $50,000 research grant. This includes identifying areas where pedestrian deaths are most common.

The Design Studio for Community Solutions previously worked on pedestrian safety issues in Maryvale where according to director Erik Cole, there are a number of high-risk areas.

“The city has identified some hotspots where there are repetitive deaths of pedestrians,” Cole said. “We’ve heard from the community that this is a critical issue that needs to be addressed. This is an area where walking is not really a choice, it’s a necessity.”

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/philadelphia-bans-cashless-stores-and-restaurants/,Philadelphia,Philadelphia is first city to ban cashless stores and restaurants,"Philadelphia has become the first city in the U.S. to require most retailers to accept cash

Some business owners say handling cash is inefficient and invites theft

Critics of cashless merchants say the practice discriminates against low-income people



Philadelphia has passed a law requiring most retail establishments to accept cash, making it the first U.S. city to ban a practice critics say is discriminatory.

Mayor Jim Kenney last week signed the law, passed by the city council in February, banning stores and restaurants from implementing cashless policies. It will take effect July 1, and business owners who don't comply will face fines of up to $2,000.

Cashless policies are gaining currency in a number of cities, with some business owners saying that handling cash is inefficient and invites theft. But opponents say cashless establishments exclude people who are ""unbanked,"" or those lacking checking or savings accounts. In 2017, 8.4 million U.S. households were unbanked, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.

Philadelphia city councilman Bill Greenlee, a co-sponsor of the bill, said the new law restores the right of everyone with money to do business in stores.

""I can go into a coffee shop across from City Hall that's cashless and get my coffee and muffin, but the person behind me that has United States currency can't get the same cup of coffee. It's a fairness issue; it creates an us-and-them kind of situation,"" he said.

Greenlee argues that businesses have long operated efficiently while accepting cash. ""We are not asking them to do something they don't know how to do. They accepted cash before.""

Amazon isn't pleased

There is no federal law requiring that businesses accept cash; around the country, only Massachusetts has a law on the books requiring stores to accept greenbacks. Yet concerns about cashless merchants is growing, with similar bans proposed in New Jersey and New York, as well as Chicago, San Francisco and Washington, D.C.

The issue is also sparking pushback from none other than Amazon. The ecommerce giant last month threatened to scrap plans to open brick-and-mortar Go stores in Philadelphia over the proposed law -- which has since passed. The outlets have no cashiers and only accept digital forms of payment enabled by sensors and automation software.

It's unclear if Amazon is exempt under the new restrictions in Philadelphia. An Amazon spokesperson declined comment.

Other cashless retailers that might not feel the brotherly love with the new law include the salad bar chain Sweetgreen and Bluestone Lane coffee shops -- which will be forced to accept cash if they want to stay in business locally.

The Philadelphia law does not cover transactions that take place at parking lots and garages, or businesses that operate through a membership model. Greenlee said the city is open to working with businesses concerned about the regulations.

Still, he is clear in saying that intent of the new law is to protect ordinary Philadelphians. ""Our priority has to be the folks who live here now, who were paying taxes.""",[]
https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/philadelphia-safe-injection-sites-880346/,Philadelphia,Philadelphia May Become the First City to Open Safe Injection Sites,"After a lengthy battle involving numerous local lawmakers, soon, the city of Philadelphia will find out if a supervised, legal heroin injection site will open in the beleaguered Kensington neighborhood, which would make it the first city in the country to do so.

On Thursday afternoon, U.S. District Judge Gerald McHugh Jr. will hear oral arguments in USA vs. Safehouse, a suit filed by U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania William McSwain to halt plans to open a supervised injection site run by the nonprofit Safehouse. While McHugh is not expected to grant a final ruling today, the case will likely determine the future of supervised injection sites in the city, as well as serve as a litmus test for cities across the country also grappling with the opioid crisis.

Powerful exhibit outside the courthouse ahead of the hearing about supervised injection sites: a monument in memory for the 1,116 Philadelphians that died a completely preventable overdose death in 2018. pic.twitter.com/wlzQfcVOGt — Av @ US v. Safehouse court hearing (@abgutman) September 5, 2019

Supervised injection sites are regulated establishments where drug users can inject heroin on premises. Although they do not provide drugs, they do provide free clean hypodermic needles and alcohol swabs to users to reduce the risk of infection, as well as addiction support and counseling services. Medically trained staff members at the site would also carry the drug naloxone, also known as Narcan, a treatment that reverses the effects of opioid overdose, which could potentially save countless lives. According to an article published in a Canadian medical journal, safe injection sites have been associated with lower mortality rates, as well as a decrease in OD-related ambulance calls and rates of HIV infection. Critics, however, have said there isn’t enough substantive research to determine whether these sites are actually beneficial for drug users.

Although such supervised injections have long been operating in major Canadian cities like Toronto and Vancouver, they have yet to make their way to the United States. While a number of major American cities, such as Denver and New York, have announced plans to open safe injection sites, none of these have come to fruition, largely due to opposition from lawmakers, who have argued that supervised injection sites violate what’s known as the “crack house statute.” A provision of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA), the statute makes it illegal for anyone to “knowingly open, lease, rent, use, or maintain any place for the purpose of manufacturing, distributing, or using any controlled substance.” In 2018, deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein penned an op-ed for the New York Times reiterating this argument, writing that “cities and counties should expect the Department of Justice to meet the opening of any injection site with swift and aggressive action.”

Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney has expressed his approval for plans to build the site, even visiting Canada in July to tour legal injection facilities there. Yet many local lawmakers have expressed their opposition to the idea, most notably McSwain, a Trump appointee who filed a civil suit back in February attempting to prevent the Safehouse site from opening, on the grounds that it constituted a violation of the crack house statute. “This is in-your-face illegal activity using some of the most deadly, dangerous drugs that are on the streets. We have a responsibility to step in,” he told NPR at the time.

In response to the suit, Rhonda Goldfein, a board member of Safehouse, said that the crack house statute should not apply to supervised injection sites, which do not provide drugs and instead focus on harm reduction and overdose prevention. “We have a disagreement on the analysis and intention of the law,” Goldfein told NPR at the time. “We don’t think it was intended to prevent activities such as this, and perhaps it will take a court’s ruling to move the issue forward.” Lawyers for Safehouse have also argued that blocking the site from opening violates its religious freedoms, specifically Judeo-Christian tenets about the value of “preserving life.”

Philadelphia has the highest overdose rate of any major U.S. city, with nearly three people a day fatally overdosing on opioids in 2018. Kensington in particular, where the injection site would be built, is known as a hotbed for drug use, with the New York Times referring to it last year as “the largest open-air narcotics market for heroin on the East Coast.”

In 2017, Mayor Kenney assembled a task force to figure out how to solve the problem of opioid overdoses in the city. The task force recommended opening up a supervised injection site, leading Kenney to formally announce plans to open up such an establishment in early 2018. A Drexel University survey from early this year found that the vast majority of Kensington residents support plans for the site, with 90% of the 360 neighborhood residents they surveyed voicing their approval.

According to data from the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA), nearly 130 people die of opioid overdoses every day, with 47,000 Americans dying in 2017 alone.",['Protection - Health']
https://technical.ly/philly/2019/10/17/city-of-philadelphia-strategic-plan-office-innovation-technology/,Philadelphia,How the City of Philadelphia plans to use tech to drive change in government,"The City of Philadelphia’s Office of Innovation and Technology (OIT) released a public-facing plan and set of strategies to drive innovation and change within city government on Wednesday.

The report, officially called the “IT Strategic Plan: An Inclusive Approach to Crafting Vision and Strategy for Technology Across City Government,” addresses how OIT and other City departments can solves challenges in response to public needs.

The process began in early spring 2018 when those in OIT began talking internally and with other departments about what the City was doing well and what it could be doing better in terms of technology, said Chief Information Officer Mark Wheeler.

The office opened those questions up to a focus group of about 30 City stakeholders, community leaders and technologists, said Andrew Buss, deputy chief information officer for innovation management. Between internal discussion and comments from stakeholders and the public, the office narrowed down a handful of themes surrounding technology and innovation:

Support and develop the local technology ecosystem Strive for digital access and equity Improve government efficiency and effectiveness Enhance online public service delivery Promote community-driven technology Strengthen and advance internal operations and infrastructure

In the 42-page report, the department outlined goals relating to each theme, ongoing projects or programs that support them, and developing initiatives and strategies to further them.

Some of the initiatives touch on attracting and retaining tech talent to the city, making city websites and resources more accessible for residents, supporting digital literacy, and connecting with some of the city’s technology companies.

Some of the programs touted in the strategic plan are the StartupPHL Venture Program, the Digital Literacy Alliance, OpenDataPhilly and GovLabPHL. The plan also outlines developing initiatives, like CityGeo Training Sessions, which helps departments share data used for mapping, analysis and city services.

It’s not too often that internal assessments of a department are released to the public, Wheeler said, but it’s important to OIT to share the progress and intent of the office with residents and businesses.

“This is our way to tell everyone what we’ve been doing, and where we want to go next,” Wheeler said.

Stephanie Tipton, interim chief administrative officer, said themes three and four address work that the Office of the Chief Administrative Officer does, and focuses on making government work better for residents, businesses and other departments.

“It’s our way to show how we’re using our resources and to be clear about what we’re trying to do,” Tipton said.

Wheeler acknowledged that the city hasn’t been as collaborative in its past planning of use of resources, and that the department wanted that to change.

“The plan is really the first of its kind for Philadelphia and attempts to drive change,” Wheeler said. “It outlines current as well as future initiatives and strategies aimed at combining and leveraging technology, innovation, engagement, access and efficiency.”

https://technical.ly/philly/2019/12/16/pitch-pilot-philadelphia-office-innovation-technology-private-sector-tech-proposals-reduce-waste-trash/,Philadelphia,The City is looking for private-sector tech proposals on how to reduce trash and waste,"The City of Philadelphia’s Office of Innovation and Technology (OIT) released an application on Monday for its new program, Pitch & Pilot, calling for ideas for the public and private sectors to work together on innovative solutions to municipal challenges.

It’s part of a larger plan to use tech to support the economic, social and environmental goals of the City, including the SmartCityPHL Roadmap and IT Strategic Plan, the latter of which was released in October. The program seeks to involve companies in the tech space of all sizes.

The first problem the City wants folks to focus on? Trash.

Litter and waste are issues that residents consistently identify as a key problem, said Joanna Hecht, a City fellow working on the Pitch & Pilot program. Accordingly, OIT is seeking submissions for tech solutions or projects that support the goal of zero waste — that is, “to fully eliminate the use of landfills and conventional incinerators” — by 2035.

“The program is aiming to spur partnerships and create an environment in which the government can collaborate with the private sector,” said Emily Yates, Philly’s smart city director since October.

Those interested in submitting a tech product or solution — what that could mean is being kept broad for now — for consideration should ensure that the project uses an innovative approach to advance the City’s priorities; prioritizes disadvantaged residents and communities; maintains resident privacy and data security; proves its value to the city in the context of a pilot; and has the potential to scale upward, the department said. Though the submission is open to a wide range of ideas, the proposed solution should be something that’s already in the works, OIT said.

Learn more about the submission process here.

The solution chosen will receive up to $34,000 in funding, community engagement and evaluation support, and access to City resources while testing the idea. Applications are open until Jan. 16. Finalists for the program will be notified Jan. 27, and a pitch event will be held late that month to determine a winner. The company or group chosen will work through the spring on its solution, with an estimated end date in June.

OIT said it expects this round of the Pitch & Pilot program to be one of many, and that the program will ultimately get to a place where the office is working on multiple municipal issues a year — as well as will serve as a guide for how the City can work with private entities to solve municipal problems in the future, said Andrew Buss, deputy chief information officer for innovation management.

The OIT team is encouraging women-owned, minority-owned and veteran-owned businesses to apply and is hoping to attract submissions from the Philadelphia region and beyond.

“We want there to be a clear connection to communities that would benefit from these technologies,” Yates said.

https://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/news/local/philadelphia-center-city-congestion-pricing-fee/200111/,Philadelphia,Is Philadelphia Introducing Congestion Fees for Drivers? Not So Fast,"What to Know Philadelphia is considering congestion pricing to combat clogged streets.

The city currently has no specific policy on the matter.

Philly will look to New York as an example. However, New York likely won't implement its congestion fees until at least 2021.

Driving into Center City can often eat into your time, and at some point it could do the same to your wallet.

Philadelphia is considering congestion pricing - charging people a fee for driving into certain areas at certain times and days - to combat clogged streets. Though it's considering the fees, the city currently has no specific policy on the matter, Mayor's Office spokeswoman Kelly Cofrancisco said.

""Philadelphia is only considering congestion pricing as part of its overall congestion reduction efforts and has no immediate plans to implement any new related policies at this time,"" Cofrancisco said in an email.

Philadelphia ranks as the 9th most congested city in America, according to a February report by traffic analytics company INRIX. Last year, that congestion cost Philadelphia drivers $1,568 each and cost the city itself $3.3 billion a year, INRIX reported.

Congestion pricing isn't new. London, Stockholm and Singapore have had such traffic schemes in place for over a decade, the latter first applying the fees as far back as 1975.

All three cities have seen success in both traffic and carbon dioxide reduction, according to the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, a nonprofit that studies and advocates for public transit in New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut.

However, despite London's past success, the city has struggled in recent years due to exceptions like those granted to ""private hire vehicles"" used by rideshare drivers. ""Congestion levels have now risen to levels not seen since the Congestion Charging scheme was introduced in 2003 although without the scheme, congestion would be far worse than it is now,"" according to a December 2018 report by the city.

Moreover, though other places around the world have tried it, congestion pricing is still new in the U.S. New York is poised to become the first city in the country to apply such fees when it charges drivers in Manhattan.

Philadelphia will consequently be looking at New York's results to shape its own congestion pricing scheme.

""We always pay attention to policies in other cities to see if they can be adapted to fit Philadelphia's unique circumstances, and we'll be watching NYC's experience with congestion pricing closely to see how this can help improve equity, safety, sustainability, and mobility,"" Cofrancisco said.

But a big hurdle for both cities is the fact that the latter has not yet determined how much it will charge, and its fee will likely not be in effect until at least 2021. In the interim, Philadelphia is considering other options.

Already the city cut down on transit times on Market and Chestnut streets in Center City by having both Philadelphia and SEPTA police, as well as the Philadelphia Parking Authority, crack down on things like double parking and cars driving on the bus lane, according to a city report of the initiative.

Residents will also be able to vote on another proposal next month. If approved, the resolution proposed by City Council President Darrell L. Clarke would amend the city's charter to create new Public Safety Enforcement officers who would focus on quality of life issues like traffic while allowing police officers to focus on more serious crimes.

That proposal will be on the ballot at the next elections on May 21st.",['Subsistence - Mobility']

https://microgridknowledge.com/philadelphia-climate-microgrid/,Philadelphia,Philadelphia Tackles Climate Change through Partnerships,"Philadelphia will be the site of Microgrid 2020, June 2-3. Here Peter Maloney of Microgrid Knowledge looks at the city’s innovative climate strategies.

Philadelphia Mayor James Kenney earlier this month announced the creation of a private-public partnership that marks the city’s latest effort in battling climate change.

Registration is now open for Microgrid 2020: Distributed Energy and World Electrification

The Climate Collaborative of Greater Philadelphia provides workshops and technical assistance to help businesses and large organizations combat climate change. The first set of workshops focused on procuring renewable energy through off-site power purchase agreements (PPAs).

The initiative grew out of a PPA the city signed about a year ago with Community Solar for the output from a 70 MW solar plant in Adams County, Pennsylvania. The PPA will provide enough electricity to power 22% of Philadelphia’s government buildings, which will move the city closer to its goal of powering the city with 100% renewable energy by 2030.

“Folks were reaching out to us, so we decided to take a different type of leadership role” with groups that operate and construct buildings, said Adam Agalloco, energy manager in Philadelphia’s Office of Sustainability. His office is in the process of figuring out what other topics the collaborative should present in the future to work on.

Vision for Philadelphia

The city’s renewable energy goal sits within the larger framework of goals Kenney set for the city, particularly after President Donald Trump’s June 2017 announcement that he would withdraw the US from the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change mitigation.

Later the same month, Kenney signed the Sierra Club’s Ready for 100 pledge, committing to a 100% clean energy goal as part of Philadelphia’s long-term commitment to reduce citywide carbon emissions 80% by 2050. To date, 141 cities have signed the Sierra Club’s pledge.

In “Power Our Future: A Clean Energy Vision for Philadelphia,” the city lays out its strategy for achieving its goals. The plan includes installing solar generation on rooftops and other surfaces throughout the city, eliminating energy waste in homes and businesses in the city, working toward clean energy supplies from the wider grid, and taking a low carbon emissions approach to thermal energy in the city.

To reduce thermal energy needs, the city envisions wider electrification of heating and cooling from power derived from clean energy sources, as well as more efficient equipment such as heat pumps. The city is also looking at expanding the use of district heating systems, which provide both electric power and thermal energy from a single plant.

District energy and microgrid projects

Philadelphia already has several district energy systems. Veolia Energy, for instance, operates a natural gas-fired district system that provides steam to the University of Pennsylvania, Drexel University, the Comcast Center and the Philadelphia Museum of Art.

Philadelphia is also exploring the potential of incorporating microgrid projects, particularly those that pair solar power with battery storage, at large new developments. It is already home to one of the nation’s most sophisticated microgrids, located at the Navy Yard.

Both district heating and microgrids are mentioned in Powering Our Future, in the context of the need for resilient, clean energy.

“It is certainly something we are interested in, but we have not yet done a district heating or microgrid roadmap or defined an opportunity or specific potential investments,” Agalloco said.

Reducing the energy use and emissions profiles of building will get Philadelphia a long way toward its goal —nearly 80% of the city’s carbon footprint comes from buildings — but it will not get the city all the way there.

Philadelphia still buys much of its electric power from the regional grid run by the PJM Interconnection and will likely continue to well into the future. But the city has little control over the sources that provide energy for PJM’s grid. While PJM’s grid is getting cleaner, fossil fuels still provide about 63% of PJM’s electrical output.

As Powering Our Future makes clear, clean power from the grid is essential for Philadelphia to meet its goals. “We can’t reach our goals without the grid,” Agalloco said.

Enlisting partners to create demand for clean energy

To that end, the city is enlisting businesses and residents to embrace clean energy as a way of creating more demand for clean energy and to lobby for cleaner energy with campaigns aimed at state legislators. “The state legislature has bigger levers to pull,” Agalloco said.

To some extent, that is already starting to happen. In early October, Gov. Tom Wolf (D) directed the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a market-based collaboration of nine Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and combat climate change.

Making cities members of PJM

Philadelphia is also working with a handful of other cities to figure out a strategy to advocate and become members of PJM as a group, Agalloco said. “We have talked with every major city in PJM.”

PJM members have the right to attend PJM strategy and regulations meetings and vote as stakeholders, which could potentially give those cities, as a group, a greater voice is moving the wholesale regional market closer toward the goals Philadelphia and over 100 other cites cities have set for themselves.

https://whyy.org/articles/philly-pilots-program-to-pay-for-some-detained-immigrants-legal-defense/,Philadelphia,Philly pilots program to pay for some detained immigrants’ legal defense,"In immigration court, the government always has a lawyer — but far fewer than half of all defendants do.

Now, the city of Philadelphia, along with the Vera Institute of Justice, has launched a one-year pilot program offering pro bono legal support on a first-come, first-served basis to low-income immigrants facing deportation.

“Philadelphia has emerged as a fearless leader in local response to shifting immigration policy and federal immigration enforcement,” Mayor Jim Kenney said Tuesday during the announcement at the National Constitution Center. “This new deportation defense fits in with other pro-immigrant policies we embrace and continue to advance.”

Vera and the city have ponied up $100,000 apiece to support two pro bono attorneys: one with the Pennsylvania Immigration Resource Center in York, Pa., and one with Nationalities Service Center in Philadelphia. Each is expected to carry a caseload of roughly 30 clients. The program, called the Safety and Fairness for Everyone Network is in the process of recruiting funders to continue offering legal services in Pennsylvania beyond the one-year mark.

The new initiative will focus on some of the most difficult cases — those in which immigrants have already been arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and must go through their legal process from inside a network of detention facilities scattered across Pennsylvania.

Those hearings take place at an immigration court located at the York County Prison, which had 535 cases pending as of May 2019, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University.

Nationally, fewer than one in five immigrants manages to get an attorney in detention, according to the American Immigration Counsel. Without legal representation, immigrants in detention are half as likely to win their cases.

“The lack of an attorney should not be the only thing that separates a local resident from their family, from their community, and from life itself,” said City Councilwoman-at-large Helen Gym. “We’ve seen 11-year-olds go up against a federal prosecutor without the right to an attorney.”

Headlines from recent days also weighed on attendees’ minds.

Kenney added his voice to the outcry over comments made by President Donald Trump on Twitter over the weekend suggesting that four congresswomen who are U.S. citizens should go back to the “crime-infested” countries they came from.

“If Donald Trump ever has to go back to where he came from, he’s going to have to go back to hell,” said Kenney, veering away from planned remarks.

Others spoke of the supposed immigration raids Trump promised would start on Sunday, but which have largely not come to pass.

“Immigrants all around the nation are living lives full of fear because they’ve been told that the government is going to come after them this week,” said Kica Matos, director of the Center on Immigration and Justice at the Vera Institute of Justice.

The SAFE Network, which operates in 18 locations, will add to the small number of immigration attorneys already offering low-cost representation for immigrants based in Philadelphia.

Lea Dezai Epse Wanhi, from the Ivory Coast, credits her pro bono attorney with reuniting her family.

At Tuesday’s press conference, she gripped the podium and her voice shook as she described fleeing a forced marriage and pressure to undergo female circumcision before coming to the U.S., only to be arrested while waiting on the results of her asylum application in Philadelphia.

“She didn’t promise we will win, but she did say we will work together,” Wanhi said of attorney Rebecca Hufstader. In fall 2018, Wanhi went before a judge while she was detained, and was granted asylum. She later regained custody of her son and paid a bond so her husband could also be released from immigration jail.

“[Rebecca] gave us hope, and made us feel like it would be possible to be happy and have a good life,” said Wanhi.",['Freedom - Liberty']

For many, the tranquility of the outdoors has provided an escape from the stress of the current times.

The Rivard Report has kept up with this trend by covering urban fishing, the extension of the Mission Reach trail system, the desire to kayak in downtown, and people using the outdoors to escape being cooped-up at home. COVID-19 has reminded us that our creeks, rivers, parks, and green spaces are woven into our life as places that we need for personal physical and mental well-being as well as our community’s economic strength, which is why it’s important to preserve the health of these spaces.

I’m happy to see that the San Antonio River Authority (River Authority) parks and trails have experienced a significant increase in use over the last several months. Trail counters along the Mission Reach registered nearly 124,000 hits this April and May. That equates to over 7,000 more users on the trails each week this year as compared to this same time in 2019, which is an 83 percent increase. Paddling along the river is also growing as people (practicing social distancing) are taking to kayaking to get fresh air and disconnect from virtual learning and remote work in order to relax along the river.

In addition to more people enjoying the Mission Reach, River Authority, local wildlife is thriving. We recently concluded an avian study that counted over 65,000 birds using the restored habitat. Resident birds and migratory birds were counted totaling more than 200 different bird species. A few years ago, we collaborated with the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department to reintroduce the native Guadalupe bass, and our scientists have identified the fifth generation of this bass species now populating the Mission Reach. River Authority scientists are also planning to reintroduce native mussels. We are demonstrating it is possible to increase the quality, quantity, and diversity of native species in and along an urban river while maintaining critical flood conveyance, improving quality of life for area residents, and stimulating economic benefits for the community.

Aside from the apparent benefits of the Museum Reach and downtown River Walk, the ecosystem restoration along the Mission Reach also provides economic benefits. The recreational amenities available in this restored habitat are also being used as a quality of life selling point to convince people to move to San Antonio. The health of the San Antonio River, and the networks of creeks and rivers throughout the basin, is vital to our community’s collective quality of life and economy as well as our long-term resiliency and sustainability.

While more people are enjoying a relaxing time along the river and wildlife is thriving, a couple of recent Rivard Report stories show how quickly human actions can threaten the environment. An ammonia spill earlier this month killed more than 5,000 fish. River Authority staff will oversee restoration efforts and are staying engaged with regulatory agencies to pursue an appropriate response to this fish kill event. Fortunately, the response was quick and no long-lasting harm is anticipated from the spill.

The River Authority is also responding to invasive apple snails. This invasive species has been introduced into our basin by people who have illegally dumped their fish tanks into the river. These snails have few native predators and are voracious herbivores. If they were to establish in the Mission Reach, they would pose a threat. Therefore, our experts are trying to eliminate them where they have been spotted in the Museum Reach and downtown sections of the River Walk. Please remember, never dump your aquarium into the river or any other freshwater or saltwater body.

River Warrior volunteers help the River Authority with ecosystem restoration activities like planting native grasses and trees, removing invasive species, pruning, mulching trees, picking up litter, and helping maintain native habitats along the Mission Reach and at other River Authority parks like Confluence Park and John William Helton-San Antonio River Nature Park. The River Authority also offers trainings and educational events to the River Warriors so they can gain knowledge about sustainable, green infrastructure strategies like building rain gardens and become river protection ambassadors.

We are fortunate to live in a community with a long history of voter support for natural resources and elected leaders who have approved forward-thinking investments. This has resulted in, among other important initiatives, the historic San Antonio River Walk, the Museum Reach and Mission Reach additions to the River Walk, San Pedro Creek Culture Park, the Howard Peak Greenway Trails, and numerous area urban and nature parks. These places define our community and connect us to each other and to nature.

As we look toward recovery after these challenging times, it is our collective responsibility to protect our natural resources, provide more opportunities for green spaces, and connect people to nature as our population grows. San Antonio will eventually emerge from the COVID-19 crisis. When we do, let’s make sure that these spaces continue to serve our community.",[]
https://www.expressnews.com/news/local/politics/article/Can-you-get-evicted-for-not-paying-rent-It-15450311.php,San Antonio,Can you get evicted for not paying rent? It depends where you live in San Antonio,"Can you get evicted for not paying rent? It depends where...

Now that both local and federal eviction moratoriums have expired, tenants’ chances of getting evicted for not paying rent rest solely in the hands of Bexar County judges.

Early in the pandemic, Bexar County Judge Nelson Wolff and the Texas Supreme Court suspended evictions unless tenants posed an immediate criminal or safety threat. At the same time, Congress barred properties with federally backed mortgages or those participating in federal housing programs from filing evictions, a protection that ended July 24.

With those directives expired, the judges who oversee eviction cases in Bexar County can make their own decisions about whether to hold eviction court. Of the five judges who oversee the county’s four justice of the peace courts, only two are hearing regular eviction cases — which has meant that a tenant's possibility of losing their home depends on the court precinct in which they live in the city.

“It’s an extreme example of unequal justice,” said Genevieve Hébert Fajardo, a law professor at St. Mary’s University who helps run a hotline for tenants facing eviction. “Some tenants will lose their homes during a pandemic, and others won’t, solely on the virtue of where they live.”

Now Playing:

Given the uneven enforcement, it’s unclear how many eviction cases will pile up in San Antonio. Also unknown is the number of tenants who can’t pay their rent. This spring, the city set aside $50 million for rental and mortgage assistance, one of the largest outlays in the country. As a result, thousands of renters have been assisted, and the city still has about $20 million left in the pot.

Ian Benavidez, the assistant director of the city’s Neighborhood and Housing Services Department, said eviction filings are down about 40 percent compared to last year. From January 2019 through June 2019, nearly 9,800 evictions were filed in local courts. This year, about 6,000 were filed through the end of July.

Benavidez said there could be several factors driving the decrease.

One of them: It’s estimated that roughly half of San Antonio’s rental units were covered under the CARES Act eviction moratorium. After it expired, the law requires landlords to give tenants an additional 30-day notice to vacate, instead of the typical three-day notice.

When those cases resume, there could be a wave of eviction filings at the end of August, Benavidez said. But he is hoping that the city’s commitment to earmark millions of dollars to housing assistance will help mitigate that.

The city’s emergency housing fund is the largest of its kind in Texas and one of the largest in the nation, Benavidez said. For each family approved for help, the city will pay up to three months of rent, or up to $3,500; three months of utilities, or up to $1,500; internet costs; and up to $300 in cash.

By July 30, the money went to about 9,000 families struggling to pay rent and 1,700 who needed assistance paying mortgages.

As part of that program, the city set up workstations in each justice of the peace court to provide assistance if landlords decided not to move forward with evictions. With two judges now holding cases remotely, those city employees sit in on videoconference hearings to notify tenants and landlords about the assistance programs.

So far, nearly 100 cases have been dismissed or delayed so tenants and landlords could work out arrangements, with an additional 100 cases in the process, Benavidez said.

“Hopefully, we’ll be able to continue this past the emergency crisis because we know that evictions are not just a pandemic issue,” Benavidez said. “They definitely were an issue pre-pandemic and will continue after.”

Housing attorneys and policy experts argue that it’s not safe for families to be subjected to eviction in the middle of a pandemic — a process that can include going to court, having a constable move out a family’s belongings and finding a new place to live.

They are calling on elected officials to pressure judges to adopt a countywide policy on eviction case proceedings — a decision that can be made only by the judges themselves.

Right now, each court has a different plan. On the North Side, which is overseen by Justice of the Peace Court No. 3, the court is still moving forward with eviction hearings three days per week, scheduling roughly five to 10 cases on each of those days. Most cases are heard through video-conference or phone, although exceptions are made for landlords or tenants who don’t have access to the technology and want to appear in person.

The same is true in Robert “Bobby” Tejeda’s court in Precinct 1, which encompasses San Antonio’s South and West sides. He scheduled more than 60 eviction cases to be heard the last week of July.

But his peer, Judge Ciro Rodriguez, the other judge who serves in Precinct 1, is still not hearing cases, unless they pose an immediate safety or criminal threat. Neither are the judges of Precinct 2 and 4, which encompass part of the West Side, downtown and the East Side.

“It’s probably incredibly confusing for tenants themselves who are facing eviction,” said Sofia Lopez, a researcher for the Action Center on Race and the Economy, an advocacy group that focuses on racial and economic justice. “It’s all the more ludicrous that within the same precinct — Precinct 1 having two places — you could potentially have a hearing, but someone could tell you that Precinct 1 wasn’t having hearings at all.”

Judge Rogelio Lopez Jr., who oversees Precinct 4’s justice of the peace court, said under the Texas Supreme Court guidelines, judges can extend any court proceedings that they think could jeopardize the safety of their staff or public through September 30.

Lopez said he is closely watching COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations in Bexar County, which began to skyrocket in June. He won’t resume court proceedings until it appears safe to do so.

“There was obviously a (Texas) Supreme Court moratorium that ordered us to (pause eviction proceedings), but once that was lifted, the courts were given discretion as to whether or not they felt safe opening or not,’ said Lopez. “The decision and responsibility falls squarely on the shoulders of each individual judge.”

Another reason he’s not moving forward: Families facing eviction for not paying rent may not be able to afford the internet or cellphone cost to attend a hearing by Zoom or telephone. Nearly 1 in 4 Bexar County households don’t have a desktop or laptop computer, and nearly 17 percent don’t have internet access, according to 2018 census estimates.

“My court handles 40,000 to 50,000 cases a year, so to try to do proceedings without having people there is not realistically feasible,” Lopez said, referencing all his cases, including evictions, traffic and small claims. “I can't have 100 people on a Zoom call and try and run through a docket.”

Across the nation, it’s estimated that 28 million households were at risk of eviction as the pandemic and economic crisis began to unfold, according to a study released in May by Amherst, an investment research firm.

Lopez, the researcher for the Action Center on Race and the Economy, said that’s nearly three times the number of homeowners who lost their homes in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.

“It feels like we’re watching a train wreck about to happen,” said Lopez. “It’s ongoing, but it’s about to get so much worse, and our elected officials and policy makers are just completely absent.”

The council voted 6-4 Thursday to approve a concession agreement for the airport that includes chains such as Smoke Shack BBQ and Boss Wood Fired Bagels and Coffee, provided it excluded a Chick-fil-A concept.

The vote came a day after Think Progress reported that newly released tax documents show the fast-food chain donated $1.8 million in 2017 to groups that discriminate against the LGBTQ community.

San Antonio Councilman Roberto Treviño said the council's action affirms the city's efforts to ""become a champion of equality and inclusion.""

""San Antonio is a city full of compassion, and we do not have room in our public facilities for a business with a legacy of anti-LGBTQ behavior,"" Treviño said in a statement, adding that everyone should feel welcome when they walk through the city's airport.

A spokeswoman for Chick-fil-A told NBC News on Monday that it wished it had gotten the opportunity to ""clarify misperceptions"" about the fast-food chain prior to the vote.

""We agree with the council member that everyone should feel welcome at Chick-fil-A,"" the spokeswoman said. ""In fact, we have welcomed everyone in San Antonio into our 32 local stores for more than 40 years.""

She said the company invites the city council to ""a thoughtful dialogue"" on the issue and to visit local stores.

""We hope they will experience for themselves that Chick-fil-A embraces all people, regardless of race, gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation or gender identity,"" the company spokeswoman said.

In regard to the Think Progress report, the spokeswoman told NBC News that Chick-fil-A has been transparent on its website about its youth and education-focused giving.

""To suggest our giving was done to support a political or non-inclusive agenda is inaccurate and misleading,"" she said.",[]
https://therivardreport.com/san-antonio-ranked-again-among-fastest-growing-cities-in-u-s/,San Antonio,San Antonio Ranked Again Among Fastest-Growing Cities in U.S.,"U.S. Census Bureau population estimates from 2017-2018 released Thursday show that San Antonio continues to be one of the nation’s fastest-growing cities.

San Antonio saw a population increase of 20,824 from July 1, 2017, to July 1, 2018, bringing the total population to 1.53 million residents. The increase was the second-largest among the nation’s cities behind Phoenix, which saw its population increase by 25,288 new residents. Fort Worth was third, with 19,552 new residents.

Although this year’s growth was significant, the last census survey put San Antonio at the No. 1 spot among the fastest-growing cities, said State Demographer Lloyd Potter, who serves as interim dean at the University of Texas at San Antonio’s College of Public Policy. San Antonio added around 24,000 new residents between 2016 and 2017. That was the first time in recent history that San Antonio had been among the highest population growth cities in the country, Potter said.

Potter said he thought last year that the city’s growth may have been a one-year anomaly.

“But now, with the second year in the row, we’re up there with the most significant growing cities in the country,” he said.

However, such significant population increases come with implications, Potter said.

“Certainly we have been growing and been managing our growth fairly well, though some people who live in the northern suburbs might argue with that,” Potter said. “But it does create challenges for us. If we’re growing and more than other cities, we have to also grow our infrastructure – roads, power, water. … Then there are issues of schools, and things like that as well.”

Mayor Ron Nirenberg took the census numbers as a warning to continue to prioritize things such as street maintenance, economic development, and transportation. He said the City has continued to address affordable housing needs, as well as funding job training and early childhood education.

“These are all issues that dramatic growth will bring to the forefront, and we are working to stay ahead of the curve,” Nirenberg said in a statement.

Nirenberg said he was confident in the city’s direction to manage that growth.

“The census numbers show San Antonio’s rapid growth is continuing as expected with record low unemployment, and the data demonstrate that the course we have set on City Council in the last two years is the right approach,” he said in a statement.

New Braunfels also saw significant growth with a 7.2 percent increase in its population, or about 5,700 new people. It secured the No. 2 spot among cities with the most growth by percentage on the Census Bureau report.

New Braunfels has historically been near the top of that list, and the cities along Interstate 35 typically see significant growth as well, Pottery said. Austin was sixth on the list of cities with the largest population increase, with 12,504 new residents.

“You have Austin growing, San Antonio at the top of the list, and cities all in between in terms of top of list for pace of growth,” Potter said. “You really continue to see this sort of integration of the economies of Austin and San Antonio and really through the I-35 corridor.”

As San Antonio’s population continues to grow, future city leaders must plan to sustain that growth, Potter said.

“That is essentially their job,” he said. “Hopefully they are up to the challenge and able to do that in a way that ensures our quality of life is maintained.”",[]
https://therivardreport.com/san-antonio-to-ban-scooters-from-sidewalk-city-opens-bids-to-select-3-vendors/,San Antonio,San Antonio to Ban Scooters from Sidewalk; City Opens Bids to Select 3 Vendors,"The seven scooter companies operating a total of about 16,000 dockless electric vehicles in San Antonio have four months to prove they should be allowed to stay in the city, and scooterists have a month before they’re banned from riding on the sidewalk, San Antonio City Council decided Thursday.

By early October, a city government bidding process will pare the number of authorized operators to three and the number of vehicles to 5,000. On June 30, riding on the sidewalk will be prohibited.

By virtue of Thursday’s vote, the pilot program under which scooter companies were previously operating has been extended until Sept. 30.

The measure also reduced by half the number of authorized vehicles for companies that are permitted for 1,000 vehicles or more. For example, Lime, which had been approved for 4,000 scooters, will see its fleet reduced to 2,000. That would bring the total number of permitted vehicles down to 8,750, although the average number of vehicles available for use on city streets has been around 6,000.

Council was set to consider barring scooter use on sidewalks this fall, along with its selection of three scooter companies, but Councilman John Courage (D9) tossed in an amendment to issue the ban beginning June 30.

“It really is a matter of safety,” Courage said. “We haven’t talked about how many accidents have taken place recently. … Obviously, it’s a problem with [scooter riders] on the sidewalks. Let’s alleviate that problem right away.”

More than 150 scooter-related accidents have been reported to the City’s Emergency Medical Services since October, although they have decreased by 36 percent since the City implemented an 11 p.m. curfew for riding scooters in February.

Beginning its regulation of the nascent scooter-share industry with a light-touch approach, the City later shifted its rules in response to an increasing number of reported injuries and complaints about sidewalk clutter.

Councilman Manny Pelaez (D8), who has railed in recent months against the proliferation of dockless vehicles, voted in favor of the government bidding process but remained concerned that a 5,000-vehicle limit would not fix what he sees as a problem.

“I still think 5,000 is too much,” Pelaez said. “… I’m hesitant, and I’m a little scared of what 5,000 might look like. And I fear 5,000 looks exactly like what it looks like right now.”

Dockless scooter-share first landed in the city last June when Los Angeles-based Bird placed hundreds of vehicles in downtown San Antonio. The vehicles can be rented using a smartphone with rates of $1 to unlock the scooters and 15 cents for every minute of usage.

The company – along with other providers throughout the country – had operated with a forgiveness-not-permission mentality, putting vehicles on the street overnight without notifying government officials.

The City of San Antonio enacted a pilot program in response to the growing fleet of the sharable electric vehicles. The pilot began last fall with a required permit application for companies wanting to operate in the City but no cap on the number of vehicles citywide. The number of authorized companies grew to seven before the City issued a moratorium on additional permits. Permitting fees will be prorated through the extension of the pilot program.

Reflecting on the increasingly contentious scooter issue, Mayor Ron Nirenberg said the problem was exacerbated by inadequate infrastructure.

“This is our need for a market that drives innovation and transportation colliding with the fact that we’ve made really bad decisions about how to deal with our transportation infrastructure in the city,” he said.

The City will solicit bids from scooter companies beginning June 7. They are due July 22.",[]

https://therivardreport.com/san-antonio-gateway-city-opens-its-arms-to-asylum-seekers/,San Antonio,"San Antonio, Gateway City, Opens Its Arms to Asylum-Seekers","Hundreds of thousands of mostly Central American asylum-seekers continue to flood across the border from Mexico into Texas and other border states, overwhelming federal law enforcement agencies and facilities. What to do about a humanitarian crisis with no end in sight remains the subject of partisan debate and gridlock in the nation’s capital. President Trump’s latest proposal appears to be falling flat with both Republicans and Democrats in Congress.

Here in San Antonio, the gateway city on the road north to a new life for migrants, there is no time or space for such standoffs. A City-directed network of municipal staffers, nonprofits, and church volunteers is welcoming a daily wave of asylum-seekers released by federal authorities along the border and put on buses or private shuttles bound for the downtown Greyhound station.

San Antonio has never declared itself a sanctuary city, but it is a city that has always offered sanctuary to people in need, from Mexicans fleeing revolution in the early 20th century to New Orleans residents displaced by Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and, now, fleeing Central Americans. A city with a majority Mexican-American population has a culture and history rooted in migration.

“San Antonio is a city of compassion that has always been a ray of hope in both the good and the tough times,” Mayor Ron Nirenberg said Wednesday after touring the resource center. “Our city has never hesitated to embrace anyone needing a place of refuge. Today is no different as we support children and their parents seeking asylum.”

The cycle of national politics cannot change that. Asylum-seekers arriving here see their long journey turn from terror and uncertainty to relief, their first glimpse of a better life ahead. It’s a second, invisible border the migrants cross in San Antonio, one evident in the faces of parents and children alike who suddenly feel welcomed.

Some days, 100-125 migrants arrive. Other days, the number flares to 200 or more. Officials here experienced a surge in late March that overwhelmed Catholic Charities and its volunteers, leading city officials to step in and broaden the city’s response.

“Together with our community partners, the City of San Antonio is humanely treating people who are here legally and going through the asylum seeking process,” said City Manager Erik Walsh. “I’m proud that the City and our community has stepped up to help those in need as they travel through San Antonio.”

Sister Denise LaRock, a Daughters of Charity nun who spends long hours every day at the bus station, said about 21,500 family members had been processed and then put on departing buses this year, and another 8,200 had departed by air. April saw 4,000 arrivals locally, while border authorities say they are detaining that many or more on a daily basis in the Rio Grande Valley.

The number of migrant crossings and detentions along the border changes by the day. One day last week a federal official said 14,000 asylum-seekers were awaiting processing that day in detention centers, tent camps, and other makeshift facilities. The next day, that count grew to 18,000. Another official told me weeks ago that more than 100,000 asylum-seekers had been detained and processed since the start of the year. He was contradicted by another official who said more than 200,000 had crossed in March and April. The numbers, however inaccurate, reflect an overwhelmed ICE and Border Patrol.

Nuns and lay workers with the InterFaith Welcoming Coalition, formed here in 2014 as the first waves of unaccompanied children began crossing the border, greet arriving families and unaccompanied women. The bus station’s 24-hour lighting is harsh, its seating uncomfortable, but for the migrants it looks and feels like freedom. It’s their first stop en route to a new life, far from the gangs, corrupt police, and violence and poverty they have fled in El Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala.

“The migrants arrive only with the clothes they are wearing and what they can carry. And what they can carry in most cases is their young children,” said Dr. Colleen Bridger, the city’s senior public health official who oversees San Antonio’s humanitarian, medical, and shelter response. “We get no help or funding from Washington, even though we are, in effect, acting as an extension of the federal government by processing and providing vital services to these asylum seekers, who are here legally, on to their final destination.”

Each arriving adult receives a new backpack with a Red Cross blanket, a bag of 20 snacks, soap and toiletries, crayons and a coloring book, a small stuffed animal, a used English-Spanish paperback dictionary, and a reusable water bottle. Sanitary products, over the counter medicines, and diapers are distributed as needed.

Bilingual relief workers escort the migrants on a short walk from the bus station to a Migrant Resource Center, formerly a vacant office in a city parking garage. Volunteers serve a hot meal prepared by the San Antonio Food Bank. Physicians and nurses deliver medical services. Goodwill provides fresh clothing and footwear to replace the often tattered, dirty garments worn for weeks and months on the road.

Catholic Charities, which operates its own migrant shelters around the city, helps fund the purchase of bus tickets that will take the migrants on to their final destinations after being processed and spending the night at the nearby Travis Park Church, a Methodist congregation established in 1846 with a long history of serving the homeless and welcoming the LGBTQIA community.

“After working for many churches, this is why I work here now,” said Travis Park Pastor Gavin Rogers, 37, who traveled to Mexico five times in 2018 to accompany migrant caravans on their journey to the border. “People of faith have a hard time wiggling out of immigration care, but they do wiggle out because their politics pushes them in that direction. Jesus was a migrant. To me, it’s not a debatable theology. God calls us to love our neighbors. The Greyhound bus station and all the people moving it through it are our neighbors.”

A few fortunate migrants with family or friends in the United States who can afford airfare will board flights one day after arriving in San Antonio. Most face one to two days of bus travel, with many stops, layovers, and bus changes. Bilingual maps help the migrants understand travel routes, geographic destinations, and how to navigate stops and transfers. The migrants guard bus tickets and documents establishing their legal status as asylum-seekers with distant court dates like treasure.

The aging church hall is a warren of rooms crammed with cots, a safe haven for the migrants who retire early – lights out at 9:30 p.m. – with plans for early morning departures. Children hyped up by the sudden change in conditions after the long trip north and time in detention camps keep fatigued adults from their sleep.

I spent the evening speaking with migrants, listening as they shared harrowing stories that led them to flee their homelands, déjà vu for a reporter who lived in Central America in the early 1980s, covering the region’s civil wars. The lawlessness and political chaos that has reverberated down over the years now provides the setting that so many impoverished and threatened people are desperate to escape, no matter how long or dangerous the journey.

The Trump administration’s punitive cutoff of funds to the region’s agencies working to stabilize conditions there is only expected to add to the mayhem and the growing numbers of U.S.-bound asylum-seekers who have credible reason to fear for their lives at home.

Heidi Serrano, 20, a graphics designer and third-year university student, arrived here 70 days after fleeing her home in El Progreso outside San Pedro Sula, Honduras. She did so after being threatened by a local policeman who showed up at her door one night and demanded weekly protection payment of 1,500 lempiras, about $60.

“He said he knew my family must have money if I was attending a private university, but I was there on a scholarship,” Serrano said. “Someone I know must have been part of extortion plan. They gave the policeman my cellphone number and he began to track me. He finally told me he would kill me if I didn’t have the money for him by the next day. I fled at dawn.”

Jeremy Herrera Mendoza, a slightly built 12-year-old Guatemalan boy, said he was leaving school one day in March when three men who identified themselves as members of La Mara Salvatrucha, or MS-13, approached him with a choice.

“They told me they knew where I lived and I could either join their gang or they would kill my mother and younger brother,” Jeremy said.

The vicious street gang controls many of the poor urban neighborhoods in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras. Jeremy decided not to tell his mother, Karen Mendoza Centeno, 33, about the threat, and for the next week he hid out in Guatemala City, skipping school to avoid gang members. School officials contacted his mother to ask why one of their top-achieving students was no longer attending classes, forcing Jeremy to return to school where the men once again confronted him and gave him one day to decide whether to join the gang or lose his own life.

Jeremy went home and broke down crying as he told his mother the truth. She took him to local authorities, where he gave a sworn deposition documenting the gang threat. She carried the papers with her as proof in her quest for asylum.

Local officials said they could not protect the family, so Mendoza, Jeremy, and 9-year-old Abrahám boarded the first bus the next morning bound for Mexico, abandoning their home and all their belongings. Their journey turned treacherous at the U.S.-Mexico border after U.S. Customs workers in El Paso denied them entry.

“They said there were too many people from Central America seeking asylum, and even if someone told us we have the right to apply, they were not going to let us in,” Mendoza said. “We took a bus to Nuevo Laredo and lived on the streets for three days, but a policeman told us the Zetas controlled the city and we had better leave.”

Mateo Perez, 57, a family friend living and working in Louisville, wired $2,500 to Mendoza, which she paid to a coyote to smuggle them across the Rio Grande on tire tubes from Piedras Negras to Eagle Pass. Shortly after crossing, the Border Patrol detained them. One month after their departure from Guatemala they were finally in the United States and, after a stop in San Antonio, would be on their way to Kentucky to live with Perez, who Mendoza said is like his godfather.

Bridger said San Antonio’s efforts to deliver comprehensive services to the arriving migrants is straining local budgets, but the city does not intend to curtail services, regardless of how long the humanitarian crisis continues.

“At first we said, ‘Let’s gear up for a two-week response,’” she said, “but that was in late March. This is not a two-week crisis. It’s not getting any better. We now realize it’s just nonstop, it’s the new normal.”

Local millennials, baby boomers, and those in between are swarming to courses like Beekeeping Basics, an all-day workshop offered by the Texas A&M Agrilife Extension Service.

Entomologist Molly Keck, who oversees the beekeeping class, remembers when it started in 2012. “We held it once a year,” she said. Now, the six-hour tutorial for 40 to 60 people occurs once a quarter.

The course teaches best practices for beginners and includes a separate hands-on field day at which students open a hive and conduct routine inspections. The March 29 class has been sold out for weeks and has a waiting list.

“Urban beekeeping is definitely on the rise,” said Keck.

Rick Fink, 62, worked 35 years in medical sales and management. These days he serves as the president of the Alamo Area Beekeepers Association (AABA) and spends most days working with bees. Fink removes and relocates unwanted beehives from trees and attics in town and also mentors newbie beekeepers through one-on-one sessions and workshops.

When he started beekeeping 17 years ago, the AABA had 60 members; today, the organization boasts 150. He estimates San Antonio is home to 350 urban beekeepers who pursue beekeeping as a hobby, often with backyard hives.

Beekeepers cross all demographic lines, but baby boomers and young environmentalists seem to dominate. People in their 50s and 60s who enjoy a sense of community and purpose make up one contingent. Environmentally aware young folks who want to do something to address climate change constitute another demographic.

“It’s one thing to read articles online and read books, but I really wanted to dip my toe in the water and do something,” said Trinity University senior Hannah Elise Konyecsni, 22.

Konyecsni serves as the interim president of the Trinity Bee Alliance, an association of 30 to 40 students who tend two beehives atop the school’s rooftop garden. “I wanted to see what the life cycle is like, what the environmental factors are, and what can we do about it,” said Konyecsni. The bee club recently harvested honey on a cloudy day and the bees “were not happy.” But it was a cool experience, she said.

Cecile Parrish, 29, an urban farm manager at Eco Centro, a community outreach center for environmental sustainability, ranks as a master beekeeper, someone well-trained in apiary skills. She’s planning to stage beekeeping workshops at Eco Centro and suggests the reason millennials are attracted to urban beekeeping is “wanting to find something tangible to do” about pollinator decline.

“A lot of times, people don’t feel empowered to do something, but with beekeeping, you can,” Parrish said.

The surge of interest in urban beekeeping occurs at a time when the commercial side of the pursuit faces serious obstacles. Beekeepers who make their living growing bees, beeswax, or honey have had an especially tough year, with some losing 40 percent to 50 percent of their hives, according to some reports. Varroa mites and small hive beetles combined with a changing climate and colony collapse disorder have caused many small beekeeping businesses to consolidate or shut down.

Texas hosts an estimated 200 commercial beehives, according to Mary Reed, chief apiary inspector for the state of Texas. Reed’s staff of four is charged with controlling disease in commercial operations, focusing mostly on bees that cross state lines, as occurs when Texas beekeepers take their hives to California to assist with the almond harvest. Reed said she’s noticed “huge growth” in small-scale beekeeping.

“In the last couple of years, we’ve certainly had a lot of commercial beekeepers decide they just don’t want to do this any more, because there’s too much stress associated with it,” she said.

Varroa mites are the biggest problem, she and other apiary experts agree. Since the parasites arrived from Florida in the 1980s, they have become the primary threat to honeybees, weakening the population and spreading viruses.

While all beekeepers battle parasites, disease, pesticides, and unpredictable weather, backyard beekeepers sometimes face unique urban challenges.

Liz Rendon, 56, an IT manager at UT Health San Antonio, and her beekeeping mentor, Richard Treviño, were conducting a routine hive check in her backyard across from the Southtown Belgian restaurant La Frite one summer afternoon in 2011 when she spotted an oddly colored honeycomb. “What could that be?” she wondered aloud as bright red and neon green honey spilled from the frame she lifted for inspection.

“That’s Big Red and Mountain Dew honey,” said Treviño.

Even though lush gardens existed close by and the San Antonio River beckoned a few blocks away with blooming native plants, Rendon’s bees were dumpster-diving. Bees will forage for nectar and other sweet liquid carbohydrates wherever they can find them, usually within a mile or two of their hive. “The bees will be lazy if they can be,” said Rendon.

The incident motivated Rendon to move her hives out of downtown to a friend’s property in Pleasanton. Now she tends hives there and elsewhere.

An amendment to the State Tax Code in 2012 has made such arrangements beneficial for urban beekeepers and landowners. Anyone with 5 acres or more can qualify for agriculture valuations on their property taxes by raising bees. Rules vary by county about the ratio of beehives per acre. In Bexar County, landowners with between 5 and 20 acres can raise six to 12 hives to take advantage of the tax exemption.

That’s how Rendon has managed to grow her hives from two downtown to more than half a dozen at two separate properties a 15-minute drive from her house. Most weekends, you’ll find her at “the Luckey,” a 100-acre plot owned by a friend who has granted her beekeeping rights. Another pal encouraged Rendon to set up beehives on his 16 acres to take advantage of the ag exemption.

Rendon finds solace in keeping bees, admiring their “beautifully cooperative nature.” Even though she is allergic to bee stings and wears two pairs of jeans and double sets of gloves to protect herself when she checks her hives, she can’t resist their calming buzz. And sharing homegrown honey with friends gives her a sense of pleasure and peace.

“Even opening the hive is meditative,” she said.

https://therivardreport.com/san-antonio-urban-design-paves-a-path-toward-widespread-obesity/,San Antonio,San Antonio Urban Design Paves a Path Toward Widespread Obesity,"San Antonio’s built environment does not support physical activity, promoting lifestyles that lead to obesity and a number of health problems. The inclusion of a micromobility lane for bikes and e-scooters as a part of the Broadway Street redevelopment project – a project supported by Mayor Ron Nirenberg – could be a catalyst for urban design that promotes public health. But the benefits can only be reaped if every zip code is included, starting with the most disadvantaged.

Research has found land use mix, minutes in a car, and distance walked as significant indicators of Body Mass Index (BMI) across all gender and ethnic groups, underscoring the importance of urban design. However, the urban design of San Antonio discourages physical activity, prioritizing drivers over walkers or bikers. Without protected bike lanes, well-maintained sidewalks, and reduced vehicle lanes, San Antonio scores 131.2 on the Pedestrian Danger Index in comparison to the national average of 55.3.

According to the Active Living Council of San Antonio, 75 percent of Bexar county adults do not meet the 150-minute moderate-to-vigorous weekly physical activity requirement as cited by the Center for Health Statistics. While individual choices play a part, we must understand individual choices in the context of environment.

In Bexar County 65.7 percent of our adults and 32 percent of our adolescents are overweight or obese. What is even more alarming, is that the prevalence of obesity in Bexar County is disproportionately concentrated in the inner city (inside loop 410) and Southwest and Southside school districts. Not coincidentally, these areas, including zip codes 78202 and 78207, experience the city’s highest concentrations of low-income and uninsured individuals.

Health care, however, is only one factor contributing to good health and its impact is limited. Decades of compelling research suggests that social determinants such as physical environment, socioeconomic status, education, and social networks play an overwhelmingly important role in explaining our health status.

Yet, the zip codes with the most to gain from multimodal streets are not being included. While the road north of Interstate 35 to Hildebrand Avenue is included in these plans, the mile leading south into downtown from Interstate 35 extending access to 78202 is not. The obesity rate in San Antonio cannot be expected to change if intervention is not applied to areas experiencing the highest prevalence. All San Antonio citizens should get easy access to health-promoting neighborhood conditions that support us in reaching and maintaining healthy BMI, but we need to start with neighborhoods that need the most support.

It’s time we get serious about our health and the implementation of non-motorized linkages between residential, commercial, and employment areas as one important approach to improving the health of all San Antonio residents. Promoting active living spaces is important because evidence from Texas studies shows that school-based intervention promoting biking for students and parents has resulted in significantly increased recreational activity. Implementing urban design that promotes physical activity will simultaneously foster safety, equality, social cohesion, economic vibrancy, clean air, and employment in San Antonio.

San Antonio has already implemented an effective model of social and environmental change for public health. More than a decade ago, neighborhood groups, business associations, and residents joined together to support a tobacco ban in public areas. Preventing health risks attributed to obesity in the same way tobacco was identified as a leading cause of preventable disease must be a priority of San Antonio. Tobacco limits imposed from 2010 to June 2019 prioritize the health of those under 21 with limited restrictions of civil liberties for adults who choose to smoke. Our children deserve the same environmental protections from obesity as they do from tobacco.

The obesity epidemic will require changes social, economic, and built environments; the choice is to modify our society to accommodate obesity or health. Obesity intervention requires a social change from the individual to the collective. When we choose to value our health as well as our health care, we will collectively reap the physical, economic, and social benefits of health equity.",[]
https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-big-cities-housing-plans-san-diego-20190225-story.html,San Diego,"After decades of suburban sprawl, San Diego eyes big shift to dense development","San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer thinks his city has said “no” to housing for too long.

Where it once grew by sprawling — with political leaders in the middle of the last century annexing hundreds of square miles from the San Pasqual Valley near Cleveland National Forest to the border with Mexico — today San Diego is planning for an urban development boom so people don’t have to drive to work.

For the record: An earlier version of this article said residents living near San Diego’s Balboa Park protested a proposed 20-story condominium complex by wearing all black and holding up black umbrellas. The residents were protesting a 20-story apartment complex.

But that growth hasn’t happened yet, and the city’s housing costs are escalating.

So in his State of the City address in January, Faulconer proposed some of the most aggressive strategies of any California city to promote apartment and condominium construction. For San Diego residents to live affordably, the mayor said, the city must stop obliging long-held community demands to keep buildings short and stop requiring new parking spots so people have more places to live.

“We must change from a city that shouts ‘Not in My Backyard’ to one that proclaims ‘Yes in My Backyard!’ ” Faulconer said in the speech.

The mayor’s plans are part of a broader shift taking place in larger cities across California to promote growth, especially near transit stops. They also align with a push by Gov. Gavin Newsom and some state lawmakers to crack down on local development restrictions, which they believe are a major driver of California’s rising housing costs amid continued calls by neighborhood groups to shrink or deny building projects.

“There’s no question that larger cities in California are taking aggressive steps,” said Bill Fulton, publisher of the California Planning and Development Report. “That’s really accelerated in recent years as housing has become more of an issue.”

In December, San Francisco got rid of requirements for developers to install parking spots alongside new homes across the city. In the same month, Sacramento passed a plan to phase out car-centered developments, such as fast food drive-through restaurants, in the city’s downtown and other areas near transit — part of a bid to make it easier to build apartments and condominiums. And nearly three years ago, Los Angeles voters passed a plan that allows developers to build taller and more densely and receive permits more quickly for projects near Metro stations that set aside some units for low-income residents.

Like the rest of the state, San Diego has seen dramatic increases in housing costs. In just the last six years, median home values in the city have gone up more than 70% to $633,500, according to the real estate website Zillow. Rental prices have also steadily increased over a similar period with the median cost now $1,642, according to U.S. Census data.

The price surge prompted Faulconer to change his mind about some of the city’s rules.

Years ago, the mayor was such a staunch supporter of height limits — which control what type of developments are built — that he laughed at the idea they could make housing less available for people who want to live in San Diego. Now, he wants to get rid of height limits for apartment and condominium projects within a half-mile of transit stops. (The mayor’s plan wouldn’t apply along the coastline, where voters have enshrined a 30-foot height limit in the city charter.)

Faulconer has also proposed doing away with requirements that developers include parking with projects in areas near transit, rules city officials now estimate drive up costs by as much as $90,000 per spot. And Faulconer wants to relax limits on the number of homes that can be built on sites near transportation hubs.

By getting rid of these restrictions, Faulconer said, developers will build more homes for people of all incomes.

“You either have a housing crisis or you don’t,” he said. “We know that we need to increase our ability to produce housing that San Diegans can afford. So let’s act like it.”

San Diego, California’s second-largest city, is one of the few urban areas where Republicans like Faulconer retain considerable political power. But the mayor and City Council President Georgette Gomez, a Democrat, agree on the need for more growth, a perspective shared by council members from both parties. During a City Council meeting last month, Gomez chided a developer for proposing a project she believed was too small.

The proposals in San Diego coincide with the governor’s recent efforts to reward cities that make it easy to build and punish those that don’t. Last month, Newsom authorized a lawsuit against the Orange County city of Huntington Beach over state requirements to zone land for housing and on Tuesday the governor warned elected officials from nearly two dozen cities that they could be next.

Newsom also recently named Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg to lead a new commission on homelessness in a sign of support for the city’s approach to housing.

Steinberg, a former leader of the state Senate, said many local officials fiercely protect their control over development from state incursions. But he said that approach is the wrong one if city and county officials don’t use their power to tackle housing affordability.

“Cities should be doing more of these things on their own,” Steinberg said. “That’s the way it should be.”

In San Diego, resistance to Faulconer’s plans — which are in various stages of approval — is bubbling. Three trolley stops are under construction in neighborhoods surrounding Mission Bay and residents have fought for years against relaxing nearby height restrictions.

On one side of the trolley is Interstate 5 and the bay. On the other, car dealerships and one- and two-story businesses line a commercial corridor. An abandoned department store sits next to one of the new trolley stations, and a developer has discussed using the site to build 1,700 new homes in buildings up to 90 feet tall. A few blocks inland, single-family homes rise along a broad hillside.

In front of some of those homes are lawn signs that read “Raise the Balloon,” referring to a slow-growth group founded in 2014 by Bay Park resident and Realtor James LaMattery. LaMattery said he was astounded that the city was considering allowing taller buildings in his neighborhood and convened protesters to lift a 10-foot-in-diameter red helium balloon over five stories high to show how residents’ views would be affected.

“It was like raising the American flag,” said LaMattery, 66.

In making his pitch for growth, Faulconer has branded himself a “YIMBY,” which stands for “Yes in My Backyard,” a national movement agitating for more development that is led primarily by young professionals.

Advertisement

LaMattery takes issue with those who would label him the opposite: a NIMBY, or “Not in My Backyard,” for being against some forms of development.

In an email to supporters last year, LaMattery wrote that NIMBY “sounds hauntingly familiar to other classes of people that suffer institutionalized discrimination. This ‘N’ word should be added to the protected classes in anti-discrimination bills and removed from governmental documents.”

Asked about the email, LaMattery said it was “probably inappropriate” to compare the term to a racial slur. But he maintained that NIMBY was a derogatory term for those who are simply attempting to shape their communities.

Faulconer’s plan would do away with the height limits that LaMattery’s group has worked to protect. LaMattery said the resulting development would be out of scale with the rest of the neighborhood and would unalterably change the city for the worse.

“There’s going to be a huge battle,” he said. “A lot of San Diegans believe this is just a lot of L.A. development coming in.”

While community groups reacted immediately when Faulconer introduced his plan at the State of the City, political leaders did not. The lack of response stunned Cory Briggs, a prominent local environmental attorney, who then decided to run for mayor in 2020 on a platform against aggressive growth.

Briggs said Faulconer’s proposal would run roughshod over neighborhood planning and lead to the construction of expensive developments unavailable to those who aren’t wealthy.

Advertisement

“There’s no housing crisis,” Briggs said. “There’s a workforce housing crisis, an affordable housing crisis.”

Academic research indicates that new supply makes housing more affordable across a region, but that might not happen in individual neighborhoods when zoning rules are relaxed.

Gomez and Faulconer don’t have exactly the same beliefs on housing and seem headed for a clash over what percentage of development must be reserved for low-income residents if height limits go away. The mayor’s initial plan calls for no change to the city’s current rules that can require 10% of a project to be for low-income residents. Gomez thinks that percentage should be higher.

“If we are amending the regulations, what are the benefits?” she said. “I don’t want to support a project that is market-rate and have it just be market-rate. Because we’re not addressing the need for people living in the streets.”

Advertisement

Despite this divergence, city leaders remain in favor of new building — even in the face of inventive protests.

Dozens of residents living near a proposed 20-story apartment complex next to the city’s Balboa Park dressed in all black and held up black umbrellas on a playing field that they believed would be covered in shadows if the towering development were approved. The idea came from a successful protest spearheaded by former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis in the late 1980s in New York City against a development that would have shaded an area of Central Park.

The council met for nearly two hours to debate the development three weeks ago. It was approved unanimously.

When landscape architect Tomas Herrera-Mishler came to San Diego four years ago to be CEO and president of the newly formed Balboa Park Conservancy, he was astounded that the park didn’t have an updated tree inventory.

The last one was done by hand 20 years ago, taking seven years to do. Not having any of the technology that we have now, it was shelved, and the information was never updated, attributable to a lack of manpower in the city of San Diego’s Parks & Recreation Department.

Shortly after Herrera-Mishler arrived, with the help of a steering committee of industry experts, key stakeholders, and Parks & Rec staff, funding was identified to update the inventory, resulting in the hiring of Davey Resource Group, Inc.

We all know Balboa Park as a place with museums, restaurants and gardens. But it’s really more than that. It’s San Diego’s arboretum, an urban forest with immense, widespread influence. Its diversity of tree species helps filter air and water, control storm water, conserve energy, and provide animal habitat and shade. And by reducing noise and providing places to recreate, it strengthens social cohesion, spurs community revitalization, and adds economic value to our communities.

Also, it is helping realize the San Diego Climate Action Plan, which has a lofty goal of 15% tree canopy by 2020 and 35% by 2035 for the whole city. (Balboa Park is at 30% but the city as a whole is at 5-6%.)

Using the data collected from the inventory, the objective is to develop and implement a management and reforestation plan for Balboa Park that includes replanting trees on an annual basis; increasing species diversity; experimenting with new plant introductions; propagating trees of historic and horticultural value; conserving unusual, rare and endangered trees; removing hazardous trees; maintaining and protecting trees; and interpreting park horticulture.

“The incredible value of this new survey has given us a real understanding of the condition of the park,” said Herrera-Mishler.

To direct the inventory and nine other projects, the conservancy brought in Jackie Higgins, a landscape architect skilled in management information technology and restoring climate-appropriate and native California landscapes. The tree inventory was managed under her leadership and oversight, focused on establishing a baseline of data for the park.

Using GIS and GPS, the Davey team conducted the tree inventory from June 2017 to April 2018, identifying 15,515 trees throughout the park, producing up-to-date real-time information on each tree.

The Davey team collected around 20 attributes per tree including GPS location, age, site information, species, size, condition, health maintenance, diameter at breast height (DBH), a photo of every tree, age of the urban forest and recommendations/tasks.

The conservancy also commissioned another baseline study of the economic impact of the park that identified the tangible economic benefits to the San Diego region.

For example, currently the forest’s carbon storage is equivalent to annual carbon emissions from 5,770 autos, and the annual carbon emission from 2,370 single-family houses with a carbon storage value of $1,060,000. (Cash values determined by the U.S. Forestry Service.)

Explained Higgins, “These 1,200 acres help to balance out the concrete jungle that we live in. Not only do we have to make sure that we are accounting for appropriate canopy cover for our parks, we are essentially taking on the burdens of all the other areas that can’t have a canopy or other benefits that go along with that, for example, carbon sequestration, air filtration and purification, and stormwater mitigation.”

“We’re making progress,” said Herrera-Mishler. “One of our goals is increasing the diversity of the trees in the park.”

Having a broad diversity of trees is paramount for resilience from climate change and sickness. Twenty years ago, there were 348 different tree species in Balboa Park. Today there are 448, exactly 100 more. That’s astounding, Herrera-Mishler said. “And so now, with new technology, we are able to track exactly what species are doing well in San Diego with modern growing conditions. That’s a valuable data set to share with the rest of Southern California.”

Herrera-Mishler, who is especially interested in historic landscapes, said “This urban forest is 100-years-plus [old] now, with Kate Sessions starting the process [in] the beginning of the last century. We now know precisely where the heritage trees are, the survivors that have weathered drought and climate change and air pollution and urbanization and smog and all those things.”

Herrera-Mishler thinks it’s important to note that tree plantings in the park have always been public/private partnerships. Since the park’s very beginnings, regular folks have planted trees at their own expense, some successful, some not. Today, every one of the newly planted trees is being monitored by teams of volunteers called Tree Stewards, who are trained to work with other conservancy volunteer groups to plant the trees according to a very rigorous standard, working alongside other groups and representatives from Parks & Rec. Currently there are 40 Tree Stewards who monitor trees on a real-time basis, checking soil moisture at the base of a new tree, helping to insure the survival of the trees. With more funding, the Tree Steward program can expand to monitor all 15,515 trees.

So far, in the 500 new trees they have planted in the last two years, through a grant from CalFire, there’s a 98.4% survival rate. The success attributable for this rate is that Parks & Rec helped to get irrigation to the trees and the Urban Corp works with Tree Stewards and other volunteers to help with the installation of the trees.

Said Herrera-Mishler, “The conservancy is thinking about the park as a ‘forever’ asset for the community. It’s really cool when your timeline is forever.”

Anyone interested in Balboa Park’s trees and urban forest can Google “Open Tree Map” and download the Open Tree Map app and choose “San Diego Tree Tracker Map” within this app. Those interested in becoming Tree Stewards should visit balboaparkconservancy.org/project/tree-stewards/

https://www.curbed.com/2019/6/5/18652340/horton-plaza-san-diego-postmodern-jerde,San Diego,Will this PoMo wonderland in San Diego be saved?,"“Everyone agrees, Horton Plaza is dead.”

Even before San Diego’s City Council decided the fate of its once-vibrant downtown mall, the city seemed to have written it off. A vote in May made it official: The celebrated plaza that transformed San Diego’s urban center into a destination will be turned into a tech campus.

Malls are dying everywhere. But Horton Plaza isn’t just any mall. When it opened in 1985, it was as if Los Angeles architect Jon Jerde, still basking in the lingering fanfare of the 1984 Summer Olympics, unleashed the “Mariachi federal style” from the games upon San Diego’s Mission and Victorian vernacular. When the plaza first opened, its narrow passageways were adorned with banners by Jerde’s Olympics collaborators Deborah Sussman and Paul Prejza, creating a magenta-splashed encore of the design team’s critically acclaimed triumph.

The mall was an undeniable success, and cities across the country took note, crafting their own entertainment districts meant to revitalize urban cores, which had been abandoned by decades of disinvestment. Many of these were designed by Jerde, who reliably dappled color and wit onto drab streetscapes from coast to coast.

But the paradox was that even as these downtowns became a magnet for new residents, shopping revenue, and foot traffic, the malls themselves did not fare as well. As Horton Plaza’s anchor tenants fled, its developer, Westfield—which has successfully resuscitated several malls—waffled over redesign plans and ultimately sold the property.

On May 20, San Diego’s City Council voted unanimously to allow new owners Stockdale Capital Partners to convert Horton Plaza into the Campus at Horton, a mixed-use development that will relocate all shops to the ground floor, reducing the retail space from 600,000 to 300,000 square feet, and add 772,000 square feet of office space. It will still be a mall, just with four floors of offices above.

However, this plan does mean eradicating some of Jerde’s most iconic postmodern creations. Highlights include a glorious faux bell tower (it used to be a Nordstrom) and a black-and-white-striped loggia encasing the escalators, with details that grow wackier and more exaggerated the deeper one ventures into the complex. These bold, grin-eliciting elements will be replaced with the prevailing look of America’s late-capitalism era. You know the one.

“I’m aware that the postmodern style is not in fashion,” David Marshall, chair of AIA San Diego’s preservation committee, told the Union-Tribune. “Victorian houses were out of fashion in the ’40s, ’50s and ’60s, and many were demolished. Today, they are appreciated. It’s a matter of these buildings surviving those times when they’re not in fashion.”

This has been the challenge of protecting postmodernism in the U.S. Not only are the buildings often too young to be eligible for landmarking, the structures themselves must overcome aesthetic stereotypes.

Similar debates have played out around saving Philip Johnson’s former AT&T building, Michael Graves’s Portland Building, and the nearby Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, where a postmodern pergola completed in the 1990s by Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown will be erased by an Annabelle Selldorf-designed renovation.

Preservationist group Docomomo mounted a campaign to protect Horton Plaza, urging San Diego’s Historical Resources Board to consider it within the context of other treasured local buildings from the same era, like the Salk Institute and Geisel Library.

“Horton Plaza is one of the most significant examples of the postmodern style offering eclectic forms, color and excitement in a uniquely public shopping space,” read Docomomo’s letter to San Diego Mayor Kevin Falconer.

San Diegans seem to agree that more shopping space is no longer what’s needed downtown. According to KPBS, “few people spoke in opposition to the new plan” before the City Council vote. The Campus at Horton is one of a handful of tech campuses poised to remake the city’s downtown yet again—this time, in an attempt to lure plucky startups and young professionals priced out of California’s troubled boom towns to the north.

And malls are turning into tech hubs up and down the state. Google is leasing nearly all of the space in the Westside Pavilion, a mostly dead West LA mall from the same era as Horton Plaza, after a plan to redevelop the mall fell through. In Cupertino, near Apple’s new campus, the long-dead Vallco Mall will be replaced with a mixed-use development that will add much-needed housing for local workers.

Older malls, particularly urban ones, have needed to be reimagined to regain their usefulness in changing communities. A decade ago, the city of Santa Monica decided to peel the roof off Santa Monica Place, a Frank Gehry-designed mall that opened in 1980, and use the shell as a tool to reinvigorate downtown Santa Monica. Gehry’s signature PoMo moves—like zig-zagging escalators and bright perforated-metal accents—didn’t survive the renovation, but now the courtyard has an even more important role as a public breezeway connecting the Third Street Promenade shopping district to the Expo Line light-rail station.

The architect who oversaw the overhaul? Jon Jerde. It was his last major project before he died in 2015.

In a 1986 New York Times review in which Paul Goldberger likens Horton Plaza’s “freewheeling” spirit to Disneyland and draws comparisons to Jerde’s contemporaries like Graves and Charles Moore, Goldberger reveals a critical flaw in the mall’s layout, which may have sealed its fate. “If it is the heart of downtown San Diego, it is a heart cut off from its body,” he wrote, “for it has almost no connection with the surrounding streets.”

For all its urban aspirations, Horton Plaza remains completely oriented around parking garages, walling off the streets around it, and turning its back completely on the Gaslamp Quarter, a nearby cluster of late-1800s buildings which Horton Plaza’s presence helped flicker back to life.

In the same way Jerde brought daylight into Gehry’s Santa Monica mall, the Campus at Horton will now be more permeable and accessible to the city around it. And the new renderings do show that one important aspect of the mall’s design will be kept—the diagonal passage that allows people to make a mid-block move through the development—although with none of the delight of stumbling upon a whimsical checkerboard colonnade towering above.

As preservationists have argued, that central corridor is what’s worth keeping, and it wouldn't be that hard to sculpt at least a few elements into more modernized storefronts. The best possible way to do this, of course, would be to get Jerde’s firm—which, as the mall expert, continues to sensitively update older malls—to design it.

Or there’s always the alternative. At the edge of the Campus at Horton is one building that doesn’t fit in among the slick reflective towers, almost looking like some kind of postmodern folly in itself. As part of the deal with the city, developers will be responsible for restoring this historic structure, known as the Bradley Building. However, this Bradley Building is actually a simulacra built in the 1980s—after the original 1911 building was demolished to make way for Horton Plaza.

Perhaps 30 more years down the road, the pendulum will swing completely in the other direction, much in the same way the blocks of once-unpopular Victorian-era structures have been preserved and painstakingly restored in the Gaslamp Quarter. The city will regret the glass transgressions of its Hudson-Yards-by-the-Sea and order Jerde’s original PoMo flourishes to be resurrected, Bradley Building-style, through the center of the complex—rightfully returning San Diego’s most colorful landmark to its downtown.",[]
https://www.kpbs.org/news/2019/mar/04/city-council-urban-parking-minimum-housing/,San Diego,City Council OKs Sweeping Urban Parking Reforms,"San Diego City Council members Monday approved a sweeping set of reforms to the city's parking rules, intended to help wean the city off car dependence while also tackling the city's housing shortage.

The change will allow developers to construct apartment or condominium buildings with zero off-street parking spots if the housing is located within a half-mile of a major public transit stop. It will also place new requirements for developers to provide residents with ""transportation amenities"" such as subsidized public transit passes, bike repair stations or sidewalk improvements.

Mayor Kevin Faulconer, who has made housing regulatory reform a top priority for his final two years in office, told the council the city's parking requirements were outdated, and that they reduce the number of homes developers are able to include in their projects. He said one parking space can cost developers between $35,000 and $90,000.

""Those costs are then passed on to renters and buyers, making units less affordable for San Diego's working families, which are of course the lifeblood of our economy,"" he said.

RELATED: Planning Commissioners Give Thumbs Up To Urban Parking Reforms

The reforms also state when parking is provided in housing near transit stops, it must be ""unbundled"" — rented or sold separately from the housing unit. Councilwoman Vivian Moreno said this would allow car-free households to save money.

""Once you have the option to buy a unit without a parking space for less money, it makes you weigh the cost of having a car versus finding other modes of transportation,"" she said.

Councilwoman Jen Campbell, whose District 2 includes some of San Diego's beach communities, was the only council member to vote against the proposal. She said the city's public transit was not yet effective or efficient enough to allow large numbers of San Diegans to live without cars.

""Not having parking with neither provide mass transit, nor will it directly provide more housing,"" she said. ""The removal of parking requirements should be one of the last steps in moving our city away from car-centric transit instead of one of the first.""

City staffers said most new developments would likely still include some off-street parking, particularly in areas where demand is high and developers will face trouble renting or selling homes with no dedicated parking spaces.

Similar parking reforms have been approved in San Francisco, Sacramento, Portland, Seattle and several other cities.

San Diego City Council members have approved a sweeping set of reforms to the city's parking rules, intended to help wean the city off car dependence while also tackling the city's housing shortage.

https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/business/growth-development/story/2019-03-29/san-diego-downtown-planning-agency-stripped-of-power,San Diego,San Diego’s downtown planning agency stripped of power,"Civic San Diego, downtown San Diego’s official planning agency, is being stripped of most of its powers as the result of a pending court settlement. That means the agency, long seen as a friend to downtown builders, will no longer have any authority over city projects.

The dramatic shift in circumstances ends a years-long legal battle between the city and Murtaza Baxamusa, a former Civic board member who sued the agency in April of 2015. Baxamusa, who is affiliated with the San Diego Building & Construction Trades Council was joined in his lawsuit by the organization, argued that the agency lacked meaningful oversight and was too tight with developers.

In the tentative settlement, reached Thursday night, Civic San Diego has agreed to cease its planning and permitting of downtown projects; it will also end its administration over the downtown parking district. Those functions will be transferred back to the city, pending approval of the settlement by City Council. The city is also on the hook for $725,000 in legal fees, according to the settlement terms.

“Following execution of this Agreement ... Civic San Diego will no longer operate as agent for the City for planning, permitting, and non-successor project management functions,” the term sheet states.

Despite the mandated changes, the city disputes the accusations made in the lawsuit, and is not admitting that it engaged in anything unlawful. It’s also framing the settlement as a positive way forward.

“We’re pleased with this tentative settlement agreement which will elevate the planning and permitting services the city provides to our urban neighborhoods,” said Katie Keach, a spokeswoman for the city of San Diego. “This agreement will enhance our efforts to tackle the housing crisis, create jobs and improve the quality of life in our communities.”

Still, the agreement marks a major turning point for San Diego’s development community, which has relied on the agency for quick approvals. It could even dissuade brand-name firms from undertaking big projects in the region.

“When you get projects that are larger in scope, when you have to dig down several levels, they take longer to build. If they take longer to get approved and longer to build, it’s tougher to line up financing,” said Jason Wood, a principal at development firm Cisterra.

That makes projects riskier, he said. As such, the settlement will affect how Cisterra approaches its downtown developments going forward, Wood added.

The prominent, international builder is currently working on San Diego’s first Ritz-Carlton at the corner of Seventh Avenue and Market Street. The firm was also behind the Diamond View Tower overlooking Petco Park as well as Sempra Energy’s new headquarters.

Civic San Diego was formed as a city-owned nonprofit in 2012 to replace the Centre City Development Corp. and the Southeastern Economic Development Corp. The reorganization was necessitated by the statewide dissolution of redevelopment agencies that year. For roughly seven years, Civic has handled almost all of the permits for new residential towers, hotels and office buildings in the downtown region — leading to a noticeable explosion of cranes in the last few years.

The agency had been considered by analysts as a useful tool for growth. In its latest multifamily report, real estate investment and management firm Jones Lang LaSalle, or JLL, predicted downtown would remain a vibrant building location because of a straight-forward approval process through Civic.

Now, however, Civic San Diego will become more of an economic development agency. Its powers are limited to handling the continued wind-down of the former redevelopment agency and running community investment programs. It is also still eligible to receive New Markets Tax Credit allocations, which are special tax credits awarded annually by the federal government.

Andrew Phillips, interim president of Civic San Diego, said in a phone interview Friday morning that he remained enthusiastic about the agency’s future, although he noted that some members of its 30-person staff, particularly the five people who work in planning, will be affected by the settlement. The director pointed to an ongoing effort to raise $50 million for a fund that would invest in middle income developments. Civic is currently lining up projects and investors for that fund, he said.

“This settlement provides Civic San Diego the opportunity to focus greater attention and resources on executing our growth strategy within our New Markets Tax Credit and Community Lending Programs,” Phillips said.

However, Steve Coopersmith, the attorney for the plaintiff Baxamusa, characterized the settlement as an indictment against the way the agency was doing business.

""(Civic San Diego) was basically a tool for developers to get a rubber stamp on development,” he said. “They absolutely got things done quickly, but the problem is they basically got things done for the developers that the folks on the board knew.”

Nat Bosa, a major downtown builder and the chief executive of Bosa Development, vehemently denied any special treatment from Civic San Diego. But he did like working with the agency — a lot. Canadian based-Bosa Development builds in British Columbia, Alberta, Washington state and California. It recently completed the 216-condo tower Pacific Gate on E Street and is also building a 620-unit apartment building on Broadway, soon to be the tallest residential tower in the city.

“They stack right up there,” he said of Civic San Diego. “They were good.”

https://www.10news.com/news/local-news/san-diego-city-council-to-vote-on-living-in-vehicles-ordinance-051419,San Diego,San Diego City Council passes restrictions on living in vehicles,"SAN DIEGO (CNS and KGTV) - San Diego's City Council voted 6-3 Tuesday night to place restrictions on sleeping and living in vehicles on city streets and parking lots.

The vehicle habitation ordinance goes into effect immediately and restricts people from living in their vehicles anywhere within 500 feet of a school or residence. It also places an overnight ban between from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m. anywhere in the city, with the exception of approved lots.

According to a news release from the city, the ordinance aims to address illegal dumping, public urination and drug use on city streets and in parking lots.

“We are creating a balance that provides opportunities to those in need while protecting our neighborhoods from behavior that creates unsanitary conditions and hurts quality of life,” Mayor Faulconer said. “If you want to work toward finding a permanent home, we have programs that can help. We will not allow the proliferation of ‘van life’ culture that takes advantage of San Diego’s generosity and destroys community character.”

The ordinance will be enforced using criteria including sleeping, bathing, meal preparation, grooming items and containers of human waste.

Councilmember Monica Montgomery, who voted against the ordinance, released a statement after the vote expressing disappointment.

I am disappointed in today’s vote by the Council to pass the vehicle habitation ordinance. As I stated during the Public Safety & Livable Neighborhoods meeting in April, the proposed ordinance was vague, lacked the detail on the specifics of enforcement, and most importantly did not contain language to ensure that our most vulnerable populations are protected and not further criminalized.

Homeless advocates urged the council to redraft the ordinance and take feedback from those affected by it.

""This is not ready for prime time,"" said one commenter to the council.

Councilman Chris Ward openly grappled with the ordinance.

“If we don’t get this right,"" he told the council, ""I fear we are on constitutionally shaky ground.""

He ultimately voted against it.

The new restrictions replace a nearly 36-year-old ban that the council unanimously voted to repeal in February. The city hadn't enforced the old law since a federal judge issued an injunction, saying the ban was unconstitutionally vague in how it defined living in a vehicle.

The city, in partnership with Jewish Family Services, expanded its Safe Parking program in two parking lots in Kearny Mesa.

The city plans to open a third lot on Mission Village Drive this year. The lot will be the first to accommodate recreational vehicles.",[]

The City of San Diego is joining the ranks of other high-profile organizations in winning an international award for its use of geographic information systems (GIS). Earlier today, the Environmental Systems Research Institute (Esri) presented the City with its 2019 President’s Award at its annual User Conference.

“We’re using technology in new and innovative ways to deliver better customer service to our residents and improve the lives of fellow San Diegans,” said Mayor Kevin L. Faulconer. “Whether it’s reducing emergency response times, planning for future growth or fixing potholes through the ‘Get It Done’ app, geographic information systems are an integral part of city operations and provide the building blocks to leave behind a better San Diego than the one we inherited.”

GIS is mapping software which manages, displays and analyzes geographic and spatial data. The City uses it for critical services including 911 dispatch, the “Get It Done” app and street-related work order processing.

Esri, a global market leader and supplier of GIS software, selected the City out of its 150,000 worldwide customers for its leadership and innovation in GIS technology. Former award winners include the American Red Cross, UPS, FEMA and the National Audubon Society. The award comes at a fitting time, as Esri is celebrating its 50th anniversary and the City was its first client.

“Being recognized on an international stage is wonderful, but the real reward is delivering innovation and efficiencies to City services every day,” said Jonathan Behnke, the City’s Chief Information Officer. “In addition to celebrating all of our amazing GIS integrations and tools, Esri is using this recognition to remind the tech community of how important the City has been as a launchpad, developing innovative solutions to asset management, emergency response, risk assessment and spatial analytics.”

The City first began using GIS in 1980. In 1984, it partnered with San Diego County to establish a regional GIS which evolved into the agency SanGIS. Launched in 1997, SanGIS is an online hub of geographical data that is stored and publicly available to download. It includes 396 data layers and 2.2 million landbase data items, including parcels of land, road segments, intersection points and address points.

The City has continued to use GIS for services including crime analysis, brush management, fire hazard assessment, planning and community development, traffic assessment and special event permitting. More than 2,500 City staff members rely directly on GIS data for their business decisions.

With new technologies rapidly developing, the City envisions using GIS to support unmanned aerial vehicles, new strategies in monitoring wildfires, augmented reality, improved crime analytics, as well as detailing curb spaces on streets to facilitate vehicle delivery and ride-share services, semi-autonomous vehicles, and vehicular and pedestrian safety.

More than 4,200 intelligent sensors are being installed on City streetlights as part of the Smart Streetlights program, collecting GIS data on pedestrian and vehicle movement, parked cars and other mobility information. The data will help with various services including pedestrian safety, directing drivers to open parking spaces and helping first responders during an emergency. The City will use GIS to continue advancing homeless support programs and serve as a collaborative data standard for regional planning.",[]

SAN DIEGO (KUSI) – A group of local officials, leaders and representatives from the Kumeyaay Nation announced plans Tuesday to commemorate the city’s 250th anniversary throughout the year.

Mayor Kevin Faulconer and Campo Kumeyaay Nation Vice Chair Paul Cuero Jr. were among the officials to announce three public events to celebrate the city’s anniversary. The city will host ceremonies April 11 and July 16 to celebrate the arrival of the Spanish ship San Antonio and the founding of Mission San Diego de Alcala, respectively.

“This year we mark a tremendous milestone — 250 years of history, culture and achievement,” Faulconer said. “San Diego is the place where California began, and we will reflect on our past, commemorate this moment in time and look forward to building a better future for all San Diegans in the next 250 years.”

The city will also host a two-day Founders’ Day Festival on Sept. 14- 15 to celebrate both the city’s past and future. City officials said the year of events could help increase relations with the region’s Kumeyaay presence. Historians believe the Kumeyaay people have lived in the area of what is now San Diego County for more than 10,000 years.

“I want to thank the many dedicated individuals and organizations that have come together to help celebrate this important anniversary and create opportunities to learn more about our history and heritage as a city and region,” Faulconer said.",[]
https://www.nbcsandiego.com/news/local/san-diego-public-libraries-overdue-fines-forgiven-barred/136052/,San Diego,City of San Diego Grants Library Fine Forgiveness to 130K Locals,"Just like that, library fines for more than 130,000 San Diego residents were wiped clean Tuesday in a push by the city to launch a new chapter in the way locals access public libraries.

Amid National Library Week, the San Diego Public Library Foundation and city leaders – including San Diego City Councilmember Chris Cate – announced the forgiveness of library fines totaling a “couple million dollars,” according to Library Director Misty Jones.

Of the 130,000 people with fines, nearly 74,000 of them were barred from using their local public libraries because their overdue fines exceeded the $10 limit.

In San Diego’s low-income communities alone, roughly 40 percent of library cardholders were not allowed to check out materials from local branches due to outstanding fines, according to the San Diego Public Library Foundation.

“We don’t want to penalize people. We want them to bring the materials back, but we’re saying, ‘It’s OK. We understand if you’re a little bit late,’” Jones said.

The Library Foundation expects the pardon of those fines to improve library access to locals in those communities.

“Libraries are known as the 'great equalizers' because we provide equal access for all patrons, regardless of their socio-economic status,” said Jones. “Wiping the slate clean of outstanding fines means welcoming back many of the underserved patrons who most need our services.”

Cate said libraries play a critical role in transforming communities. He, too, was happy to announce the fine forgiveness efforts across the city.

“I feel that banning a child from our public libraries due to an overdue book fine is unreasonable and contradictory to the mission of our libraries,” said Cate at a news briefing Tuesday afternoon.

This process comes just nine months after the San Diego Public Library eliminated late fees for overdue books and resources. Materials and books checked out before July 1, 2018, were subject to a daily overdue fine ranging between 10 cents to $1, with maximum fines ranging from $5 to $100. If a fine surpassed $10, the library cardholder would be barred.

While the forgiven fines allowed those barred to return to their local libraries, people who don’t return items will still be charged the price to replace them.

“Now, moving forward, we don’t charge overdue fines. We want you to bring the item back. If you don’t bring it back, you have to pay for it. But we don’t charge you that late fee every day,” Jones said.

The public libraries have automatic renewals where books may be renewed up to five times. If the book isn’t returned by then, Jones said the cardholder won’t be able to check out new books in the meantime.

“But you actually have another 30 days to bring it back before you’re going to have to pay for it,” Jones said.

According to the city, a deep-dive into the process of collecting library fines showed that it costs the city more in staff time to collect those overdue library fees than the fees collected. The library collected $675,000 in fees each year, but spent nearly $1 million to collect those fees.

Cate said having library staffers dedicate their time to “chasing minuscule library fines with little to show for it was a waste of taxpayer dollars.”

The city’s analysis also showed overdue fees were preventing locals from using library services, a press release from the city said.

“We knew we needed to do something about that,” Jones added. “Officially, today, I can say that no one has a library fine, anymore, which is very exciting.”",[]
https://www.dallasnews.com/news/2019/09/18/dallas-city-council-approves-budget-focused-on-retaining-hiring-cops/,Dallas,"Dallas City Council approves budget focused on retaining, hiring cops","The Dallas City Council on Wednesday unanimously approved a budget for the next fiscal year that bumps the pay for midcareer officers and adds an estimated 19 cops to the police force, without a tax rate hike.

The $1.44 billion general fund budget focuses largely on the retention and recruitment of Dallas police officers. Mayor Eric Johnson said it's the first time the budget has passed unanimously since 2014 and believes it demonstrates ""a return of civility"" at City Hall.

At a news conference shortly after the vote, Johnson -- joined by all the council's members -- said the budget ""is a win"" for taxpayers and police and fire and ""positions our city to meet the demands of the future, to invest in our people ... so that everyone can share in Dallas' prosperity.""

Council members can also say they decreased the city's property tax rate for a fourth year in a row -- from 77.67 cents per $100 of valuation to 77.66 cents.

A council amendment last year to increase minimum salaries of starting cops to $60,000 left midcareer officers with a pay gap and the city with a $5 million gap in the budget, city officials said.

Johnson said he hopes the budget ""reflects our commitment to public safety"" but also continues funds for social services.

In last-minute budget amendments, council members discussed how to use the remaining $125,000 in tax savings that weren't enough to reduce the tax rate beyond the one-hundredth of a cent. An amendment by council member Omar Narvaez used $25,000 of those savings to add to the Senior Affairs Commission's budget.

Council member Lee Kleinman advocated to keep the money untouched in reserves. After several council members agreed, Deputy Mayor Pro Tem Adam McGough withdrew an amendment for additional implicit bias training.

""We don't have to spend every last penny,"" Kleinman said.

The total budget for the next fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, is $3.8 billion.

City Manager T.C. Broadnax initially pushed a tax hike, to 78 cents per $100 of valuation, which would have increased revenues by another $4.5 million. The strategy was to anticipate the Legislature's new restriction that caps cities' property tax revenue collection at only 3.5% above the previous year.

But strong opposition from council members prompted city officials to find other sources for savings. Council members then considered cuts to the proposed budgets of offices focused on human and social services. Broadnax instead proposed a compromise, which found savings in other areas of the budget.

Broadnax said city officials ""had a few bumps and bruises"" during the budget process, and that he'll continue to talk to council members about how they can come to a consensus more quickly.

Public safety

Mike Mata, president of the Dallas Police Association, on Wednesday thanked council members for boosting public safety funding. He said their efforts to recruit officers, and their decision last year to increase starting salaries, are working.

""The citizens of Dallas felt they were not protected. They are the ones who called you to action,"" Mata said. ""You are changing the pay policy so that we are no longer hiring those, training those and seeing other cities take them away. We are correcting something that has been broken for three-plus decades.""

The $874.9 million public safety budget — which includes police, fire, emergency management, municipal courts, the marshal's office and the jail contract with Dallas County — makes up more than 60% of the general fund.

Police and fire budgets total about 58%, or $834 million.

The public safety budget also adds to the state-mandated $162 million contribution — a $5.2 million increase over last year's required amount — to the Dallas Police and Fire Pension System.

Council members on Wednesday also approved a three-year $99.4 million meet-and-confer agreement that negotiates pay with police associations.

Many council members said they were committed to making those public safety investments without a tax rate hike. Mayor Pro Tem Adam Medrano said that in his seven years passing a budget, it's the first time that the council ""worked together as a team.""

Other services

With a tight budget and less revenue coming in the next few years, Johnson acknowledged the budget didn't invest as much in infrastructure as he would have liked. Council member Jennifer Staubach Gates said she hopes council members invest more in streets in the coming years.

Several members of the public also urged the council throughout the process to focus on tackling poverty in Dallas and criticized the elected officials for considering cuts to proposed budgets for social service offices.

Sara Mokuria — co-founder of Mothers Against Police Brutality and a member of Our City Our Budget, a coalition of activists calling for more social service funding — at the public hearing Wednesday morning blasted city officials for being focused on police above other significant needs.

""This budget, which we say is a public safety budget, should be an anti-poverty budget,"" Mokuria said.

The budget included a few minor changes, such as additional Wi-Fi hot spots for $238,000 in an amendment by Jaime Resendez, three more senior planners for $210,000 in an amendment by Chad West, and $1.2 million for 15 firefighters to work at Fire Station 18. Another $1.5 million would be used for Park and Recreation's youth access and after-school programs.

But during the briefing, Narvaez said ""every single penny"" of the $40 million added to the budget went to public safety.

""We didn't get to do anything different, and that's the hard part,"" Narvaez said. ""This time around public safety wins out, and it should because our first responders are putting their lives on the line, and they deserve these dollars.""

https://www.dmagazine.com/frontburner/2019/06/the-city-of-dallas-is-finally-taking-its-tree-canopy-seriously/,Dallas,The City of Dallas Is Finally Taking Its Tree Canopy Seriously,"Dallas has a $9 billion asset that it hasn’t been properly managing. The public learned that the hard way earlier this month, when 70 mile-per-hour winds shot down into the earth and uprooted thousands of mature trees all over the city. They fell on power lines and homes and vehicles and utility poles. What were once oaks and cottonwoods and pecans were turned into browning piles, stacked neatly near curbs awaiting their future as mulch.

We know the city’s urban canopy is worth $9 billion because the nonprofit Texas Trees Foundation raised enough money to study how many trees exist in the city (14.7 million), how they’re distributed (37 percent are south of I-30), and the environmental benefits these bring us (the annual capture of almost 60 million cubic feet of stormwater runoff—that saves $4 million in repairs—and storage of 2 million tons of carbon—that’s good for $137 million in savings).

The next step is something that the city has never had: an Urban Forest Management Plan, which would establish processes for keeping the existing trees healthy, identify the best places to plant additional trees to mitigate heat, and possibly reassign city staff to better maintain the canopy. This isn’t for the Trinity Forest either, where a management plan was created more than 10 years ago and sits unused. This is for the rest of the city, where the trees are vulnerable because of development and a lack of care.

“We have a lot of great things going on internally here at the city, but we also have resources that exist like our reforestation fund, which hasn’t been used as much as it should be,” says James McGuire, the city’s director of environmental quality and sustainability. “What’s lacking is something that will allow us to coordinate those efforts, measure year in, year out how many trees we’re adding, whether we’re taking care of our urban canopy or not, and something that would allow us to respond to events like the last few weekends.”

The City Council was notified in a memo today that staff has engaged Texas Trees to create this management plan. The total cost is $230,000, with the city pitching in $50,000 from the reforestation fund that McGuire mentioned in the quote above. Texas Trees raised the rest itself. “Once developed, an UFMP will help make us a resilient, proactive, tree-smart city that recognizes a robust urban tree canopy as one of our primary tools in combating the urban heat island effect and climate change,” the memo reads.

This is the final domino for the work Texas Trees has done over the last decade. In 2009, the nonprofit published its urban canopy study, which was the first time any organization bothered to look at what Dallas had. The Urban Dallas Forestry report broke down what that canopy is made up of, finding that 90 percent of what exists north of downtown was planted as single-family housing grew. (This is also when we put dollars to what the canopy was worth.) The organization also helped the city update its Article X ordinance, which was supposed to help guide how developers manage and plant trees. (The overhaul included such things as mandating developers not plant trees under power lines or near underground utilities that could be damaged by roots.)

After that came the rather terrifying 2017 study of the city’s urban heat island effect, finding that Dallas was heating up faster than all American cities but Phoenix and Louisville. The city had not considered its canopy holistically, and about 37 percent Dallas’ land mass is covered in “impervious surfaces,” which is jargon for concrete: roads, buildings, parking lots, garages, you name it. One way to fix that? Be smarter about what you’re planting and where they’re going. And then maintain them.

“How do we take better care of the urban forest we have now and how do we grow it in a thoughtful and strategic way?” asks Matt Grubisich, Texas Trees’ director of operations. “It will be the roadmap that—if the City Council chooses to adopt and puts resources to it—shows how to move Dallas forward to maintain this asset.”

Grubisich anticipates the process to last about 10 months. The renowned naturalist consulting firm Davey Research Group will establish an advisory committee of stakeholders; he wants this to include everyone from Oncor and city staffers to the White Rock Lake-area hippie—that’s my word, not his—tree lovers. Davey will research all the city codes and charters related to tree maintenance and planting. They’ll interview each city department to figure out whether City Hall’s organizational chart needs some reconfiguring. For example, Grubisich says there are numerous foresters in different departments, like Water Utilities, Community Development, and Public Works.

“You guys are already spending a whole lot of money, so if you restructure this thing in a different way you may be able to do a lot of good with less money,” he said.

One of the reasons all those trees were uprooted in recent weeks is because of poor maintenance, according to Janette Monear, Texas Trees’ director. Many weren’t pruned the right way or often enough. They’re overwatered, causing the soil to saturate and the roots to migrate closer to the surface. When a bad storm comes, that’s a formula for uprooting.

“Straight-line winds, if trees are pruned correctly and taken care of correctly, they hold up really well,” Grubisich says. “They’re shooting from the hip right now.”

The major change will be buy-in from the city. As critics have noted, Texas Trees was the motivator in studying the city’s urban canopy and how improved management and smarter planning can mitigate the effects of climate change, particularly in concrete-heavy neighborhoods like the Medical District. Grubisich said it was important to have the city as a partner in developing this plan, to ensure that the processes it establishes will actually be followed. That’s why it was key for the city to pay for some of it. Cities that have had successful urban forest management plans—Grubisich names Pittsburgh, Sacramento, and Palo Alto—were born of a similar arrangement. The city is a partner, and vowed to adhere to its principles.

Pittsburgh will soon have a dedicated nursery to help the city replace what’s been lost to development. The plan guides where those go. New York City was able to map out a plan to spend $385 million over 25 years on things like monitoring, reforestation, and management. McGuire sees this initiative as the first step in equitably distributing natural resources to underserved neighborhoods in South and southern Dallas. And once trees get planted, there will be a process for long-term maintenance.

“There has been a lot of work done so we can drill into the areas of the city that are really suffering from the urban heat island effect,” he said. “It does include that statement you made about planting the right tree in the right place, and I would agree that we haven’t always gotten that right. A plan needs to address those things. But it needs to address these equity issues and this extreme heat issue so we’re not just again throwing trees in response to an individual’s demand, we’re doing it in a way across the city that makes good policy.”

The memo was paired with an announcement on the forthcoming Comprehensive Environmental & Climate Action Plan, which is how the city plans to improve its own energy footprint. If all goes according to plan, trees will finally be an important, intentional tool to help the city prepare to battle the ongoing effects of climate change.",[]
https://www.texastribune.org/2019/07/02/why-homelessness-going-down-houston-dallas/,"['Dallas', 'Houston']",Why homelessness is going down in Houston but up in Dallas,"In the 1990s, Houston's urban core looked very different than it does today, with restaurants and coffee shops mingled among a burgeoning number of high-rise residences downtown. The city's bayous hadn't yet been beautified, with the clean biking and running trails that now wind through parks.

Back then, the bayous were a refuge for the city's homeless residents. And downtown, a multitude of organizations served food or offered beds, often without a lot of coordination with one another.

Latest in the Homeless in Texas series

“Everybody was walking down the streets of downtown to get to the soup kitchen or to the day shelter,” Thao Costis, president and CEO of the homeless outreach organization Search, remembers. “Church groups would have clothing or a fast lunch for them. It was very reactionary to these basic needs.”

But things have radically changed. While redevelopment has maybe made homelessness more visible to the urban core's new residents, the numbers show a 54% decrease in the Houston area's homeless population since 2011. This is according to the Point-in-Time count, a census that is done at the end of each January across the country, including in 11 urban areas of Texas. Although it is extremely difficult to count the homeless community in a precise way, experts agree that this process gives a good snapshot that allows people and governments to analyze general trends, and Houston’s numbers look exceptionally low.

In the meantime, other Texas cities, like San Antonio, Fort Worth and Austin — which recently passed an ordinance that allows sitting and camping in public — are experiencing increases in the number of residents who don't have homes. And such an increase is especially dramatic in Dallas, which according the 2019 Point-in-Time count, saw its homeless population surpass Houston's.

These counts can vary each year depending on how meticulously they are conducted, and some cities have experienced increases once they’ve perfected the methodology, like the Dallas area did in 2015. But no one denies that the rising number of homeless people is a growing problem in this city and its surrounding region.

“If you look at our percentage of growth over the last three years [from 2015 to 2018], it is higher than most of the other cities in the country. It is really alarming,” said Wayne Walker, executive director of the Dallas faith-based homeless organization Our Calling. “If you see our Point-in-Time count compared today to what we had last year, Dallas has more homeless people than any city in the southern U.S. except for Phoenix.”

So how do the two most populated regions in the state tell such different stories?

“It's very perplexing, to be honest, because you have leaderships in both communities that are very concerned with the issue,” said Eric Samuels, president and CEO of the Texas Homeless Network. “In Houston, the former Mayor Annise Parker made it a priority to end homelessness. [Current Houston Mayor] Sylvester Turner has also made it a priority. But you can't say that [former] Mayor [Mike] Rawlings, in Dallas, did not make it a priority, because he did.”

In Houston, the change in direction started in 2010.

The year before, while Dallas had counted 3,701 people on the street and in shelters, the number in Houston was 7,576. The Department of Housing and Urban Development then designated the Houston region as a priority community for assistance.

“Houston was notified by the HUD that we were not doing an adequate job on homelessness,"" said Mike Nichols, interim CEO of the Coalition for the Homeless of Houston/Harris County, the local continuum of care, a regional planning body that coordinates housing and services funding for homeless people. “We became a test site, with tremendous help from HUD.”

Things didn’t improve right away. In 2011, Houston reached a peak of 8,538 people in the late January count. But the wheels were rolling. The organizations involved in the issue knew they needed to get the community united around the cause. They started a plan that first focused on military veterans, a group that represents roughly 9% of the national homeless population.

Organizers decided to challenge themselves to find housing for 100 veterans in 100 days.

At the time, it had been taking them around 220 days to find housing for a veteran. But they reached the goal of finding housing for 100 veterans in three months. The success gave them a credibility boost in the city.

“It was an early win. We got it, and then we built around that,” Costis said.

In three years, Houston would house 3,650 veterans, in what would become a model at the national level.

The change was achieved with a lot of coordination among Parker, HUD, police, businesses and about 100 organizations. Eva Thibaudeau-Graczyk, chief program officer of the Coalition for the Homeless, said the collaboration “brought new partners to the table with resources that had never been there before.”

Among them was the Houston Housing Authority. “Prior, they’ve never seen themselves as a leader or a main partner in ending homelessness,” Thibaudeau-Graczyk explained. But since then, this agency was key, allowing the city to complement the funds for homelessness provided by HUD with the resources that were already available for affordable housing.

“This starts off with a simple dictate: The solution to homelessness is a home,” said Andy Icken, chief development officer for Turner, the current mayor. “Our focus was to create permanent supportive housing, so that we're not continually cycling people in and out of shelters, temporary or more permanent shelters.”

The good results translated into more funds from HUD because part of that money was tied to performance. From 2008 to 2018, Houston added more than $18 million. To put that in perspective, in 2018, Dallas’ total funds from HUD were $16.5 million.

Although there are still challenges like encampments in different parts of the city, since 2012, Houston has housed around 17,000 formerly homeless people, according to the Coalition for the Homeless. Many are connected with supportive services.

“If you have a homeless person and you put them in [permanent supportive housing] and simultaneously give them social, behavioral and health support services, 92% of them will be stable in that facility,” Nichols said.

But there’s a secret in Houston’s formula: coordination.

The scenario from 20 years ago, when different organizations would serve food, give clothes or offer shelter — all done separately — has changed. There’s now constant communication between these institutions and a digital database called the Homeless Management Information System, which allows people at several organizations to understand each case. Most cities today have HMIS in place, but Houston was quick to adopt it, and that helped organizations strategize, analyze, share information and find personalized solutions.

About a decade ago, Percy Lyons arrived in Houston, hoping to live with his father.

“But his mental state wasn’t right,"" Lyons, now 44, said. ""He turned his back on me.”

Lyons ended up living on the street. At some point, he applied for housing, but he never heard back from anyone until a police officer saw him and decided to check what had happened with his case, in collaboration with Search.

“They pulled out my information and saw everything,” Lyons said.

Thanks to this coordinated database, officials could find out what had happened — his case was ""lost in the system,"" he said — and try to find a solution for him.

Now he lives in a permanent supportive housing unit.

“The difference of what is going on in Houston is its networks,” Lyons said.

The challenge of affordability in Dallas

Although Carl Falconer has worked with homeless people for more than two decades, his first Point-in-Time count in Dallas was this January. In November, he moved to Texas from Florida to become CEO of the Metro Dallas Homeless Alliance, the local continuum of care, which brings together around 85 shelters and programs in Dallas and Collin counties.

“One thing that stuck out there that night is that people in the streets did not have a sense of hope in the system,"" Falconer said. “They didn't have any confidence that they would be out of the streets any time soon.""

It is difficult to separate this reality from the soaring Dallas real estate market, something that Houston is experiencing, but not to such intense degree. In the recently published Harvard report The State of the Nation’s Housing, the Dallas metro area is mentioned as having the highest volume of home sales in 2018 ($9.2 billion, the same as Los Angeles). But home prices there grew 42% between 2006 and 2018. Only Austin, Denver and San Francisco topped Dallas in this indicator.

“Our homelessness numbers reflect the increase in housing costs across the Metroplex,” said Daniel Roby, CEO of the Austin Street Center, one of the biggest shelters in the city.

He remembers coming to the center as a volunteer when he was 7 years old. At that time, suburban powerhouse Plano was practically grasslands. Now he says that he gets homeless people in the center from that city or other suburbs even farther out.

“Our Metroplex is massive compared to what it was then,"" he said. ""But we have not grown our social service infrastructure. For the most part, we have the same number of beds now that we had then. Maybe we’ve added a few hundred beds, but our Metroplex has grown 10 times over.”

According to Monica Hardman, director of Dallas City Hall's Office of Homeless Solutions, around three quarters of homeless people are “economically homeless,” which means they fell into homelessness due to some kind of unforeseen problem, without a safety net. That includes situations like losing a job or having an unexpected health issue or an accident.

“We have not grown our social service infrastructure. ... Maybe we’ve added a few hundred beds, but our Metroplex has grown 10 times over.” — Daniel Roby, CEO, Austin Street Center

“One of the biggest factors is the housing conditions and the housing market here in Dallas. [It] is extremely hard to find housing that is affordable, especially if you are not making a living wage,” Hardman said.

For people like Carlton Nalley, who lives near Dallas City Hall and spends most days in the Downtown Branch of the Dallas Public Library, this isn't just about housing.

“The prices in general are going up,” said Nalley, who has been homeless since 2017, when he was released from federal prison. “Buying in the farmers market is like going to a shopping mall. You have to make three times the rent, and that will give you a small place in a neighborhood where you won't feel safe.”

And the rapid redevelopment in the city's urban core could exacerbate things, especially since it is arriving in areas that weren’t as highly valued before and is replacing affordable units. Then there's another potential problem: expensive new residences' sudden proximity to existing shelters.

“Right behind us, probably within a matter of six months, there's going to be rents of $3,000 potentially for a one-bedroom unit,” said Rebecca Cox, chief services officer at The Bridge, one of the leading providers of homeless services in the city. “We are concerned that we are going to be seen as undesirable.”

But affordability isn’t the only problem in Dallas. Institutions play a role here, too.

Roby said Houston has some governmental advantages.

“They have a strong mayoral form of government,"" he said. While in Houston, the executive power is in the hands of the mayor, in Dallas, the mayor plays a role similar to a board chairman, with a city manager directing most departments and employees. ""We [in Dallas] need to collaborate to get the support here, while there, the mayor can just move on with the mayor’s agenda.""

At the same time, Dallas has had issues in terms of affordable housing. In March of last year, The Dallas Morning News discovered a case of corruption in a $825,000 contract to build and repair affordable units. HUD has been conducting audits, and the city might have to pay millions back for mismanaged funds.

Meanwhile, City Hall only got its first department dedicated to homelessness in 2017.

“For example, if there was a homeless encampment in a park, the parks department would do their best to clean it up, and they would contact the police department if there was resistance, but there was no one really there as an advocate to be able to talk to the persons experiencing homelessness, and then to be able to link them to shelter and to services,” said Hardman.

And the Homeless Management Information System, a key part of Houston’s success, has had hiccups in Dallas. It’s going to be changed for a third time soon, and many in the community have resisted the previous versions.

“It is exceptionally difficult to be able to have a high-functioning collaborative system when you change it so often,” said Roby.

But nothing matters if Dallas doesn’t build affordable housing, Falconer said. The unsheltered homeless population increased 725% from 2009 to 2019. The sheltered homeless population remains relatively stable because the number of beds at shelters has been the same for a long time.

“The unsheltered number is going up because the shelters are full,” Falconer said. “People don't have anywhere to go; they can't go to the emergency shelters, and the reason why the emergency shelters numbers remain the same is because housing is not affordable and people can't move out of the shelter.”

Dallas needs more housing, especially what is called rapid rehousing, which includes a bed, services and financial assistance for short periods. City officials, in the meantime, have put in place a program with four tracks: They are paying a shelter $12 per night per bed for up to 90-day stays; they have been working to create shelters for inclement weather; they got $1.3 million in the 2019 fiscal year budget for rental subsidies and other housing assistance; and they plan to build or create 1,000 housing units over the next three to five years. For the last item, the city will be dedicating $20 million in bond funds, and the request for developers' interest was just released.

Falconer is hopeful.

“One of the things that drew me to Dallas is that I really feel this is an opportunity to end homelessness here. Not manage it, not make it a little better — end it,” he says. “The resources that we have here, the community we have here, the providers that we have here, even the programs that they've already set up, we have a really good structure in place.”",[]

Blame it on Dallas' urban heat island effect: heat produced by densely concentrated people, vehicles and energy use.

And when the city's hot, you can bet the roofs are on fire. That's why ""cool roofs"" are among the initiatives the city of Dallas has implemented to reduce the urban heat island effect.

Cool roofs are designed to reflect, rather than absorb, the heat and can even help cool the inside of a building, according to the U.S. Green Building Council. Since 2013, the city requires all new construction in Dallas to have cool roofs as part of the Green Building Ordinance.

These measures aren't just green but they're also cost-effective.

""They have the potential to reduce emissions in one of our biggest sectors — buildings and energy — in a way that cuts energy costs to the consumer,"" said James McGuire, director of the Dallas Office of Environmental Quality and Sustainability.

New buildings in Dallas must: use roofing materials that reflect solar heat on at least 75% of the roof's surface; have a vegetated roof that covers at least 50% of the area; or use a combination of the two, according to requirements by the Green Building Council.

A 2014 study found that in metropolitan areas cool roofs could help temperatures drop by about 3 degrees.

Setting an example

As buildings comply with Dallas' cool roof requirements, others are going beyond that by seeking certification for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design. LEED is a rating system that certifies buildings with green features that are energy and resource efficient and good for the environment.

The Perot Museum of Nature and Science, which has LEED gold status, boasts a “living roof” that — in addition to mitigating the urban heat island effect — is designed to catch rainwater and condensation from the building’s mechanical equipment, according to Mike Spiewak, the museum’s vice president of exhibitions.

“The mission of the Perot Museum is to inspire minds through nature and science,” Spiewak said. “The museum’s ‘living roof’ is more than just a visually interesting shelter, it also serves as an educational illustration of the diverse biomes of Texas, from the deserts of West Texas to the prairies of Central Texas.”

The museum's roof filters water into cisterns that hold 50,000 gallons used to irrigate the grounds and to serve other nonpotable water needs such as toilet flushing, Spiewak said.

The Trinity River Audubon Center in southeast Dallas also boasts several green features, including a vegetated roof on its administrative wing, water-efficient landscaping, paving to control stormwater and other efforts that gave it a LEED certification.

Other buildings, like Victory Block G at 2370 Victory Ave. and AMLI Fountain Place at 1800 Field St., are taking LEED-based approaches without the official certification.

Going beyond

While Dallas requires all new construction to have cool roofs, New York City took it a step further by providing existing buildings with cool roofs through a program called NYC CoolRoofs.

The initiative installs cool roofs for free or at a low cost to nonprofits, community or recreational centers, schools, hospitals, museums, cultural centers, and co-op housing. Since 2009, more than 5 million square feet of rooftops have been coated throughout the city, according to New York's office of sustainability.

Other cities are going beyond roofs to cool things down. Los Angeles, for example, in 2017 began painting black roads white with a cool pavement treatment. The treatment can keep things 10 degrees cooler on a summer afternoon, according to the Los Angeles Department of Public Works.

The cooler roads are costly, however, with a price tag of $40,000 per mile, according to Business Insider.

In Mexico City, hundreds of highway pillars are being turned into vertical gardens through a project called Via Verde. The project aims to help regulate temperature, reduce air pollution, lessen noise and even decrease stress for residents of the Mexican capital.

Other cooling methods

Cooling off man-made structures isn't enough to mitigate the urban heat island effect in Dallas. Planting more trees is also part of the city’s strategy.

A study on urban heat island management by the Texas Tree Foundation proposed Dallas plant 250,000 trees to help reduce the heat island effect.

Dallas has begun to chip away at that figure through ""Branch Out Dallas,"" a city-funded program aimed at cooling the city by giving residents free trees. In the spring the city gave away more than 2,600 trees, and a similar event is planned in the fall.

Dallas is also in the middle of developing its first climate action plan, which will be unveiled in spring 2020. The plan is expected to tackle several environmental issues including water and wastewater, buildings and energy, food and urban agriculture, and climate resilience.",[]

https://www.newgeography.com/content/006210-gentrification-dallas,['Dallas'],Gentrification in Dallas,"The Dallas-Fort Worth area has experienced stunning growth, however Dallas remains one of the most economically and segregated cities in America. Through eye-opening data and pointed solutions, Cullum Clark argues that Dallas can become a national leader in reviving upward mobility in his essay, ""Gentrification in Dallas"".

Clark's essay is part of a new report by the Center for Opportunity Urbanism, Beyond Gentrification: Towards More Equitable Growth which explores how unbalanced urban growth has exacerbated class divisions, particularly in the urban centers of our largest's metropolitan areas.

Read an excerpt of Clark's piece below.

The Dallas region is a microcosm of America’s latest urban evolution. The Dallas-Fort Worth metro area is booming, fueled by a range of thriving industries and a tremendous influx of people and businesses. The city of Dallas — home to 1.3 million of the 7.4 million in the DFW metro — has experienced a stunning resurgence from the dark days of the 1980s oil and real estate crash.

Yet for all its heady growth, Dallas still faces many of the defining challenges bedeviling other major cities and the nation as a whole: a dwindling middle class, growing bifurcation into “have” and “have-not” neighborhoods, an emerging home affordability problem, and rising numbers of poor citizens for whom twenty-first century prosperity seems a sham. In certain respects, the city’s revival has compounded these challenges.

Dallas remains among the most economically and racially segregated cities in America, in part reflecting the heritage of Jim Crow. The poverty rate in the city of Dallas is nearly 23%, one of the highest among large American cities. At the same time, Dallas has a greater opportunity to address these challenges than most of its peers, in view of the DFW area’s economic vibrancy and the city’s comparatively abundant and inexpensive land. Unlike most big cities, Dallas has the potential to build its way out of its current challenges.

Dallas urgently needs to pursue three policy directions in order to shift to a more inclusive and sustainable pattern of urban growth. First, it needs to spark a new home building boom focused on middle and lower-income families, especially in depressed southern Dallas. Second, it should adopt a range of smart policies to preserve and rehabilitate as much of the existing housing and commercial real estate stock as possible in less advantaged areas. And third, it needs to get considerably more creative about bringing urban amenities — innovative schools, stores, restaurants, health clinics, greenspace and arts facilities, and the middle-skilled jobs that come with them — to historically underserved areas. If it gets these things right, Dallas can become a national leader in reviving upward mobility and the promise of the middleclass American Dream.

The city is partnering with the Texas Trees Foundation to develop a plan that will protect the city’s trees and plant more of them to keep the area cooler when temperatures rise.

It's a coincidence that the plan's announcement comes weeks after straight-line winds downed hundreds of trees across Dallas, said Susan Alvarez, assistant director for the Office of Environmental Quality and Sustainability.

“But it is certainly no less important that we do it now,” she said.

The Urban Forestry Master Plan has been the subject of several months of talks and more than half a year of fundraising, Alvarez said.

Together, the city and the trees foundation will work to find the best ways to protect healthy trees, strategize on where to plant more trees to help mitigate the ""heat island effect"" — the heat produced by people, vehicles and energy use in large cities — and unite urban forestry efforts.

“We have foresters in multiple departments, but we don’t have a cohesive program. We’re hoping this plan can help get us there,” Alvarez said. The plan ""becomes a more holistic look at what our tree canopy is.”

The Texas Trees Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting and enhancing urban forests in the state, raised $230,000 for the plan, which will be matched by $50,000 from the city, according to a memo presented to the City Council last week.

“This is a big step. It is the culmination of a lot of work by a lot of different people,” said Matt Grubisich, director of operations and urban forestry for the foundation. “When I first moved to Dallas 19 years ago, trying to talk trees at the horseshoe [the council] didn't get very far. It was development first.”

In addition to keeping the city cooler during the summer, protecting the city’s trees would also save Dallas money.

A 2015 study by the Texas Trees Foundation found that the city's trees — 14.7 million of them — save the city more than $9 million annually through energy conservation and an additional $4 million in repairs to stormwater management infrastructure by collecting 59 million cubic feet of runoff.

The study also could provide insight on where the city needs more trees. It found that 37% of the city’s total tree canopy — the layer of trees that cover the ground when seen from above — is south of Interstate 30.

Davey Research Group, a naturalist consulting firm, will be tasked with developing the plan, which will take about 10 months, Grubisich said. The firm will form an advisory group — made up of tree experts from outside the city, city department heads, neighborhood organizations, and companies such as Oncor — to get insights on what the plan should include.

“You have different people touching trees, but you need to have a goal and a vision,” Grubisich said. “A master plan sets the vision and goals for the city’s urban forest.”

The master plan will provide a framework, and then the city can begin to decide where it will plant more trees, how many and other details, Grubisich said.

In what Alvarez called an “incredibly good parallel effort,” the city hopes to roll out the plan next year around the time the Dallas climate action plan is launched. That's scheduled for April.

Before then, the city plans to give out about 2,500 trees to Dallas homeowners on Nov. 2, Texas Arbor Day. Dallas hosted a similar event in the spring, when it gave out over 2,600 trees through Branch Out Dallas, a city-funded program aimed at reducing the heat island effect and improving air quality.

The trees handed out in November will be Texas natives “that will do well here,” Alvarez said.

Grubisich said he's hopeful that by fall 2020, Dallas could begin to see large-scale tree-planting efforts.",[]
https://www.dallasnews.com/business/technology/2019/05/16/dallas-could-land-major-uber-expansion-thousands-of-jobs/,['Dallas'],"Dallas could land major Uber expansion, thousands of jobs","Dallas is a leading contender for a major expansion by ride-hailing giant Uber that would transform the city into one of the tech company’s largest hubs outside San Francisco, company officials confirmed Thursday.

Uber has zeroed in on a site in Deep Ellum for an office that would employ several thousand workers, from engineers and finance executives to salespeople. Jobs would span Uber’s businesses, from delivering food to developing a new urban air taxi service.

Uber plans to make a decision by late August, after narrowing its list to fewer than a handful of cities, said spokesman Travis Considine. He declined to identify the other cities being considered.

If Uber chooses Dallas, it’s planning to move into the Epic, an 8-acre development on the eastern edge of downtown Dallas in Deep Ellum, Considine said. It is at Elm Street and Good-Latimer Expressway.

The San Francisco-based company’s expansion would be a big win for the city of Dallas. The city has seen major development after major development — including Fortune 500 headquarters — pick the suburbs over the city. Toyota North America opened its new headquarters in Plano. Pharmaceutical giant McKesson’s headquarters moved from San Francisco to Irving. And Texas Instruments recently announced it’s going to build a $3.1 billion manufacturing facility in Richardson.

Dallas was reported to be a frontrunner for Amazon’s second headquarters, but it ultimately missed out. Amazon split the project, dubbed HQ2, between New York City and Washington D.C. area. Amazon later backed out of the New York expansion plans.

With Uber, Dallas gets a chance to prove it not only can lure big fish — but also reel them in.

Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings said Uber's interest in Dallas ""is consistent with how our marketplace and how our city is being viewed by corporations across America.""

""They see us as a place where they can do business, have a great place to work and have a great deal of tech talent,"" he said. But he added, ""It's not over. We have to keep doing everything we have to do to convince them to come.""

Uber declined to say if it's seeking tax incentives from the state, county or city. The city approved a $2 million tax break over the next decade for developers of the Epic project. Dallas County approved a 10-year tax abatement, worth an estimated $550,000 in tax savings, for developers to convert a historic building into a hotel.

With Uber, Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said he sees tax incentives as ""the last steps in the marathon.""

""It's a great project, and it's the sort of jobs that we need to draw to Dallas to really increase our average wage and provide good opportunities for people in our urban core,"" he said. ""We are excited to be a part of hopefully a successful effort to bring them here and if they come here, I'll make sure to increase my use of Uber and encourage everyone else to.""

The property that Uber is eyeing is a joint effort between landowner Westdale Real Estate Investment and Management and office developer KDC. It includes an office tower, apartment high-rise and restored historic building that's becoming a luxury hotel. It has room for two more towers.

Developer KDC, which built the office tower at the Epic, would not comment.

Real estate brokers and developers tracking the deal said Uber has told them it will need the office space starting before the end of the year. The just-finished Epic office building would be able to immediately accommodate a first phase of Uber's employment.

Dallas is a major market for Uber. It was the first Texas city to get Uber's ride-hailing service in September 2012. Since then, Uber has added food delivery service, Uber Eats, and chosen Dallas as the testing ground for its urban air taxi service, Uber Air, that it plans to demonstrate in 2020. In March, Uber signed an up to $1.5 million contract with Dallas Area Rapid Transit to provide free and discounted rides to help connect people to nearby light-rail and bus stations. It also has bike-share and scooter-share in Dallas through Jump, which it owns.

Uber’s plans for a large new corporate hub come soon after its debut on the New York Stock Exchange in early May. Its rival, Lyft, began trading on the public markets in late March.

Uber is building a new 1.1 million-square-foot headquarters in San Francisco that's expected to open in 2020, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

Uber is planning to expand in other cities. The company's second largest hub now is Chicago, which has over 1,000 employees. Uber is in discussions about leasing a 450,000-square-foot office in a building being redeveloped along the Chicago River, according to The Chicago Tribune. If it follows through on the deal, the lease would be one of the largest ever signed by a technology company in Chicago, the Tribune said.

It's reportedly looking for more office space in New York City, too. It is visiting sites with between 250,000 and 350,000 square feet around Bryant Park in Midtown and 3 World Trade Center in Lower Manhattan, according to a late April report by Crain's New York.

Uber also has a large presence in Washington, D.C., and its Advanced Technologies Group — which focuses on autonomous vehicle development — is based in Pittsburgh, near Carnegie Mellon University.

But Dallas is competing for an office that would be equal in headcount — or potentially bigger — than Chicago, according to Uber’s Considine.

Rawlings said Dallas is attracting major tech companies' attention because their employees want quality of life amenities, such as new parks that are underway in downtown.

""Whether you want to eat at a Thai restaurant or play with your dog in the park or go to a good show, every year we get better and better at this stuff,"" he said.

Uber has about 140 employees in Texas. Its largest office in the state is in downtown Austin, where it has about 90 employees who work in sales, recruiting, operations, marketing and public policy. It has about a dozen employees in a small office in Dallas' West End. The company's careers site lists eight jobs ranging from finance and accounting to software engineers and a global employment tax manager.

The company has nearly 11,000 employees in the U.S., according to a registration statement it filed with the SEC ahead of its initial public offering. In the April filing, the company said it planned to increase its headcount significantly to keep up with expansion across the globe.

https://www.govtech.com/fs/infrastructure/Dallas-Transit-Chief-Calls-for-Federal-Infrastructure-Funding.html,['Dallas'],Dallas Transit Chief Calls for Federal Infrastructure Funding,"(TNS) — Dallas Area Rapid Transit president Gary Thomas on Monday urged Congress to deliver a far-reaching infrastructure bill, joining other public transit leaders in stressing the importance of funding billions of dollars in improvements.

Speaking at news conference hosted by the American Public Transportation Association, Thomas said it was ""imperative"" to ""supply the needs of the American people.""

He offered up a few upcoming DART projects to make his case: the Cotton Belt commuter rail line; platform extensions on the Red and Blue lines; rail replacement in downtown Dallas; and ""D2,"" the long-awaited second rail alignment through the city center.

""As we look at the fourth-largest metropolitan area in the country and one of the fastest growing areas in the country, we're constantly looking at how we continue to address the congestion issues,"" he said.

This is not the first time Thomas and other transit leaders have pressed lawmakers for action.

The notion of an expansive infrastructure bill is a perennial favorite in Washington. Both Republicans and Democrats from all over the U.S. tend to like the idea, which would address the widely documented problem of America's overstressed roads, bridges and railways.

But Congress has yet to act on the matter since President Donald Trump took office, in part because there is deep disagreement on how to pay for it all.

Transit leaders on Monday nevertheless expressed optimism that there was a legit chance — for real, this time — to soon pass an infrastructure package, with Thomas singling out Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-Dallas, and Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, for praise on the issue.

""We'll continue to work with the entire delegation, but those are the folks we're going to look to for leadership,"" he said.

Much of the attention around a potential infrastructure bill gets tied to highways and other car-centric projects. The American Public Transportation Association is hoping to change that dynamic.

The group is seeking put to put a brighter spotlight on the public transportation element of such legislation by identifying more than $230 billion in mass transit projects that could benefit from an infrastructure bill. A big chunk of those projects would address a backlog of needed repairs.

The list might be somewhat overstated, since it includes, for instance, a couple of DART projects already moving forward.

But Thomas said the D2 project, with its targeted opening date of 2024, is a $1.4 billion endeavor that could really benefit from a robust infrastructure package. He also said he'd like to see any future legislation ""include a much heavier emphasis on technology.""

The DART chief noted the success his agency has had with its GoPass app, which is a planning and ticketing tool.

He said that ""transit agencies, public agencies of any kind, are risk averse — none us want to get out there and get slapped around because it didn't work."" Incentives could encourage more agencies to be more aggressive in trying out new technology and approaches, he said.

https://www.fox4news.com/news/city-of-dallas-works-to-spread-eviction-protection-information,['Dallas'],City of Dallas works to spread eviction protection information,"The end of the month means many people struggling to pay rent during the pandemic could be receiving eviction notices.

The city of Dallas is providing a layer of protection during this time, but some people aren't aware of their new rights. City officials say they are doing their best to spread the word.

“We're trying to mitigate avalanche of homelessness in the middle of a pandemic,” said Priscylla Bento, Policy Manager, Dallas Fair Housing Office.

Bento wants landlords and tenants to know that as long as there is a disaster declaration in place, people have more time to stay in their homes.

“We've had folks who have come back, received notice to vacate and the locks were on the door,” Bento said.

The city of Dallas passed an ordinance in April that requires landlords to first give tenants a notice warning them of a possible eviction.

“If you receive a notice to vacate or notice of possible eviction you do not need to immediately vacate, there are protections in place and a process,” Bento said.

After the warning notice, tenants have 21 days to provide documentation of a financial hardship due to COVID-19. Then they have another 39 days to try to come to an agreement with their landlord on a payment plan.

Justice of the Peace Judge Al Cercone says he's not seeing an increase in evictions in spite of the surge in unemployment.

“There doesn't seem to be as many cases as we would normally have in previous years when there wasn't a pandemic. Landlords it appears may be being lenient with their tenants,” Cercone said.

In April, advocates for landlords argued the ordinance would be unfair to landlords, who also have bills to pay to continue to provide safe housing.

Bento says the ordinance does not delay evictions that are not COVID-19 related.

""You may have a hardship due to COVID, but if you commit a crime, pose a physical threat, breach your lease beyond threshold of non-payment you can be evicted,” Cercone said.

A group of activists, artists and local residents gathered in the wee hours Saturday morning to paint a sprawling street mural honoring the lives of homeless residents in San José.

As the sun came up over the Gardner Community Center, organizers trickled onto a stretch of West Virginia Street to start chalking in the dark. Laden with paint, buckets of chalk and doughnuts — and while dodging the occasional car — activists began laying down the artwork they want to inspire passersby to feel both empowered and part of the larger social justice movement that’s swept the Bay Area this summer.

“I hope that they appreciate the art and the beauty of it, but that it makes them think — it makes them think about their neighbors and the messages contained in it,” said Shaunn Cartwright, a homelessness advocate and organizer. “And I hope they feel represented, whether they’re housed or unhoused.”

Cartwright and several other local activists drew inspiration from the Black Lives Matter mural that activists painted near Backesto Park on July 4th. Working with local tattoo artist Benny Arana O’Hara as the chief designer, the team voted on the 14 phrases that best encompassed their intersecting messages.

The finished product — emblazoned with sun-orange, lavender and turquoise — shows two fists pounding, with their thumbs almost touching in the middle, as a collection of Spanish and English words like “resilient,” “orgullo” (pride) and “mental health” dance around them. A vertical scarlet stripe cuts through the center to symbolize the systemic practice of redlining, which shunted Black and brown communities out of neighborhoods and services for decades across the U.S. and the Bay Area.

Briena Brown, 21, an upcoming senior at San José State University, joined the festivities to represent the San José/Silicon Valley NAACP. Last month she was one of 16 artists chosen to paint a block letter in the Black Lives Matter mural along Palo Alto’s Hamilton Avenue.

For Brown, the mural shows the inextricable connection between homelessness and racism. A whopping 20% of San José homeless residents are Black as compared to just 3% of the population, while Latinx people make up another 41% as compared to 32% of the population, according to the 2019 city homelessness census. And it’s personal, too: Her father was a homeless student at San José State before her.

“It’s very interconnected to me — most of the people who are homeless are BIPOCs,” Brown said, meaning Black, Indigenous and people of color. “We had all that time during the pandemic to think. We stayed home, we were reflecting. We were doing all this shadow work with ourselves and our communities so that when this movement started, it started something new, because we didn’t have distractions.”

As a growing team of about 50 people began painting over the chalk outline, bobbing their heads to “Funky Town” and “That’s The Way (I Like It),” volunteers set up a T-shirt tent and prepped for a hand sanitizer and food drive. Soon local politicians like Supervisor Dave Cortese and California State Assemblymember Ash Kalra took the mic.

“In San José, we see the most egregious examples of income inequality. You see the tale of two valleys, with the working class that’s being crushed under the weight of this enormous amount of wealth — because the wealth in no ways comes into the communities that not only need it the most, but helped to create that wealth,” Kalra told the crowd.

Just behind the mural, Biebrach Park is a frequent target of police who come to prey on unhoused people, Palomares-Mason said.

“Children are not eating. Elders are not eating,” she said, choking up. “Everyone complains about the homeless, but what are they doing?”

The mural, she said, is a “message that needs to be heard.”

After years of constant noise complaints from residents living near the diesel train tracks, San Jose has finally figured out a way to keep the racket down.

The city plans to create an overnight “quiet zone” along the Union Pacific Warm Springs Railroad corridor, requiring train operators to silence their horns at crossings from 10 p.m. to 7 a.m. The quiet zone would run 1.8 miles long — from the crossing at Montgomery Street near the Diridon Station past the Hensley and Japantown neighborhoods and end at Horning Street near the northern city limit. The changes could come as early as November.

Train operators have long been required, under federal law, to sound their horns at crossings to warn nearby motorists and pedestrians to stay away from the tracks — unless a city like San Jose can meet certain requirements, such as warning signs and bells at crossings, and establish a “quiet zone.” A study completed earlier this month confirmed that San Jose meets the requirements to move forward with its plan after issuing notices to specific stakeholders such as Union Pacific.

“Over the last (year and a half) our residents have suffered greatly from sleep deprivation, and the establishment of this partial quiet zone will finally restore the quality of life for residents along the Union Pacific Railroad corridor,” Councilmember Raul Peralez, who represents the city’s downtown core, said in a letter to his constituents.

It wasn’t until February 2019 that the jarring train signals became unbearable for many downtown San Jose residents.

That’s when Union Pacific significantly increased the number of trains passing through San Jose every day and began running trains at night as part of a plan to reduce idling locomotives. Union Pacific now operates an average of six trains per day — three trains during the day and three trains between 8 p.m. and the early hours of the morning.

Jason Muehring, who lives about a block away from the tracks in the Hensley neighborhood and has been working with the city closely to find a resolution to the disruption, called the city’s plan for quiet zones “a great accomplishment.”

“I’m thrilled that later this calendar year, my family and my neighbors will finally be able to sleep through the night without being woken up by train horns,” he said.

But Muehring isn’t fully satisfied just yet.

He wants to see the city expand it to a 24-hour quiet zone, so that not only could neighboring residents enjoy better sleep at night but Japantown businesses and visitors could also experience fewer interruptions during the daytime.

To require trains to silence their horns at all hours, however, is a much more cumbersome and costly task that requires constructing new safety measures and infrastructure at railroad crossings. Those safety upgrades — such as improving signals and installing pedestrian gates — at all 14 crossings along the corridor would cost between $19 million and $32 million, according to a study completed for the city earlier this month.

“Our next priority is to see what we can do as a community to secure funding,” Muehring said. “Then we can put this nightmare behind us.”

According to a statement on its website, Union Pacific believes quiet zones “compromise the safety of railroad employees, customers, and the general public.” But Union Pacific spokesperson Tim McMahan said the company is “encouraged by the City of San Jose’s commitment to study a quiet zone in the area and will continue to work in partnership with city representatives on this solution.”

While the overnight quiet zone is expected to substantially cut down on the use of horns, train operators will still be required by federal law to sound their horns when they see hazards such as pedestrians walking along or across the railroad corridor.

Last summer, the city considered suing Union Pacific, claiming that the nighttime freight trains — and their failure to keep the track corridor free from blight and trash — posed a nuisance. A memo from Mayor Sam Liccardo in May of 2019 said the company “chose to burden our downtown residents with nighttime operations to improve their own profits.”

Although the city inevitably opted not to pursue litigation, Union Pacific proactively began to resolve at least one of the city’s main qualms late last year. The railroad operator in December launched an extensive, citywide cleanup and abatement effort along its San Jose tracks — the first of its kind in recent years.

Without jurisdiction over Union Pacific’s right-of-way, the hands of city officials historically have been tied to address resident complaints of blight and trash as homeless encampments and illegal dumping along the tracks have become more prevalent.

In December, San Jose seemed on the verge of an agreement with Union Pacific that would require the company to clean up its right of way roughly once a month and allow the city to enter the tracks for law enforcement calls and homeless outreach.

But nearly eight months later, the city and Union Pacific have yet to finalize the agreement.

“That document has been frustratingly sitting with the lawyers for Union Pacific since March 16,” City Attorney Richard Doyle said. “We haven’t gotten any comment back.”",[]
https://sanjosespotlight.com/plan-to-turn-old-san-jose-hospital-into-urban-village-criticized/,['San Jose'],Plan to turn old San Jose hospital into urban village criticized,"A plan to revitalize a sleepy roadway is getting pushback from residents.

Santa Clara County’s newest project aimed at creating a livelier neighborhood is underway, after lawmakers on Tuesday approved a mixed-use urban village at the former San Jose Medical Center site, but the plan is being sharply criticized for lacking retail or sustainability concepts.

The 12-acre slot project — the East Santa Clara Master Plan — offers space for office and retail use with 550 to 800 units of housing, located at 14th and Santa Clara streets in downtown San Jose. According to a county report, the goal is to create a pedestrian friendly, affordable and mixed housing space.

County officials reported that “the scale of the development will contribute to the density of activity that makes a city energetic and attractive” and that an “active and vibrant” public space relies on an “appropriate mix of amenities.”

“With very little exception, this downtown neighborhood has not been NIMBY at all. They want more retail, housing and office,” said Supervisor Cindy Chavez.

But neighboring residents expressed a desire for more retail and commercial space, particularly walkable restaurants, cafes and a grocery store following the closure of the downtown Safeway.

Many community leaders said the project fails to provide those amenities to the public.

“They say this will be a very active space and that’s good, but of no use to the residents of the adjacent neighborhoods,” said Terry Christensen, a political science professor emeritus at San Jose State University. “With the current design, this will end up being another deadened facade.”

Christensen is concerned about the amount of “restricted open space” within the project — areas between buildings that are gated for the exclusive use of residents. “Where that’s been done, you never see a soul in these spaces,” he added. “The Housing Authority staff said that would be different at this project because these would be areas for kids living in family housing or elders living in senior housing. I hope so — but I’m skeptical.”

The plan is a collaborative effort between Santa Clara County and the Santa Clara County Housing Authority, which also includes office space for the Housing Authority’s offices and an 8,500 square foot public plaza between the two office buildings along East Santa Clara Street.

Housing is needed, said Christensen, but more retail spaces also need to be included to make it a true “urban village” concept.

Otherwise it’s not a village — it’s a housing development with some office space — a disappointment that falls short of the promises the county made, Christensen and other residents said.

The plan currently calls for just two retail spaces. Christensen wants to see the entire first floor of both office buildings filled with retail shops, an effort to create a vibrant corridor. The two office buildings are expected to rise five to six stories.

Catalyze SV, a nonprofit focused on smart development, agreed that the project’s proposed retail quantity is “woefully inadequate.”

The group’s leaders said in a letter that the plan should also provide an alternative to car-centric culture by creating more walkable and bike-friendly pathways and incorporating gardens, taller buildings to improve housing density and sustainability approaches centered around minimizing a carbon footprint.

Some residents say the plan does not consider the historical preservation of the old hospital site, and instead aims to demolish it.

“We want you to respect the structure and its place in our neighborhood,” said county resident April Halberstadt. “The plan that’s coming before us does not reflect the concerns, needs and desires of the neighborhood and fails to understand our overall history. So far — we know we’re just in the planning stages — but we’d like to see the building identified as important.”

Chavez agreed with those concerns and proposed some key amendments to expand the “retail footprint” of the area. She also suggested exploring the preservation of the historic hospital buildings, creating taller buildings for more housing units beyond the 800 unit mark and eliminate the need for a parking structure. She added that a taller building limit is “the only way retail is going to come alive on that street.”

The supervisor called for a retail study with the city of San Jose to address some of those concerns.

“I know we’ve gotten a lot of feedback and input,” added Chavez. “The neighborhood has to have lots of different housing types — it’s a very mixed neighborhood already and that’s what makes it so interesting and beautiful. We’d like to keep it that way.”

Plans call for offices, some retail and 500 to 800 housing units for practically all income levels.

“We’re looking at the full spectrum from seniors and families to recently homeless and possibly market rate,” said David Barry of Santa Clara County’s Facilities and Fleet Department.

The Medical Center closed its doors in 2004.

Two county buildings for Social and Health Services occupy a small portion of the land, but most of the three city block area is vacant.

“It’s just sitting here growing weeds,” said Michael Lee, who lives nearby.

Lee says a lot of homeless people frequent the area, and nearby parking spaces have become a magnet for homeless campers.

“So it needs to be turned into something positive,” he said.

Besides housing, new office buildings would be built for county departments, including the Housing Authority.

But Mayor Sam Liccardo says the plans fall short of what neighbors have been asking for, specifically more retail, restaurants and shops to make it a vibrant walking district.

“There’s not an adequate level of retail at this point,” Liccardo said.

The existing retail area consists of a Walgreens and a few other shops. But overall, it’s been a quiet area for years.

County officials are cautious about adding too much retail before there is enough demand.

“There’s already a lot of vacant retail in the area. Hopefully the city will take into account is what can they do to come up with a comprehensive plan for retail in the area and not put it all on this one site,” said Barry.

Building permits will be filed later in 2019 and the plans still have to go through a lengthy approval process.",[]
https://sanjosespotlight.com/san-jose-new-urban-village-plans-could-displace-low-income-renters/,['San Jose'],San Jose: New urban village plans could displace low-income renters,"A new development planned for west San Jose is expected to displace a handful of mostly low-income San Jose residents to make way for a new mixed-use 7-story residential and commercial urban village.

“I thought this was going to be my forever home,” said Debra Hernandez, 66, who’s retired and has lived in her one-bedroom residence behind a pupuseria for about seven years. With only a Section 8 housing voucher and a supplemental income of less than $1,000 a month, she said finding a new place in San Jose is a struggle. “We’re one step from being homeless. If we don’t have money for a new place, we’re homeless.”

A project application filed in April shows new plans for a new “Mid Century Modern aesthetic” building, with 104 apartments, 12,619 square-feet of commercial space and a basement-level parking garage at 1530 West San Carlos Street, where eight cottages house Hernandez and about seven of her neighbors.

“We’re being booted out,” Hernandez said. “Only the rich are going to live here.”

The former property owner, Liem Nguyen, told San José Spotlight he sold the property to Cupertino-based Urban Villas LLC through its real estate broker, Viji Mani. He declined to disclose the price.

“It’s time to move on,” Nguyen said.

Mani did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

But his former tenants — some of San Jose’s most elderly, disabled and poorest residents — are having a hard time moving on as they scramble to find a new home.

And while the area may seem secluded, tucked away behind a restaurant, a car dealership and a fence, all of which will be leveled for the new development, Hernandez and her neighbors say they’ve developed their own community that will be hard to replace when they’re forced to leave. She said many of her neighbors depend on each other as they age and battle ailments together and find refuge in each other’s company.

“To have a community of friendship, that’s awesome. And that’s being broken up,” Hernandez added. “For other people’s gain, they’re willing to sacrifice other people’s health and well being.”

Hernandez considers herself “lucky” — she was able to find a condo in the city to rent at below-market rate.

Jo-Ann Bonin, 55, has lived on the property for 15 years. She’s had nine back surgeries during that time and, as she prepares for a tenth, she has to find a new place to live.

When needed, she calls her neighbors to watch her cats while she goes to the doctor or picks up medicine from the pharmacy — and she’d do the same for them. But she’ll likely have to give that up when she moves to a different place.

“It’s always been a pleasant place to live,” Bonin said. “I’ve always loved it. The thought of having to leave is very depressing.”

And her other neighbor, Gabriela Gabrian, 51, is facing the same struggle. Gabrian, who’s formerly homeless and has resided at her home near Hernandez and Bonin with a housing voucher for a decade, doesn’t know where she’ll go when the eviction notice lands on her doorstep.

“I’m not in a hurry to move because I don’t want to make a desperate move,” Gabrian said. “I want to move to a place that will continue to serve me and nurture me.”

As a terminal cancer survivor, she said having stable housing has been her escape from “traumatic experiences” like homelessness, and called her current living situation “the most stability I’ve ever had.”

Though if she doesn’t find a new place to live soon, Gabrian said she might find herself back on the streets again.

“I’m going to stay until the very last day,” she said. “I have fear that I may not find a place.”

It’s unclear whether the city’s Ellis Act protections, which offer financial support to help displaced residents relocate, will apply in this situation, officials said.

“It is not common in San Jose,” Jeff Scott, spokesman for the city’s housing department, said of the Ellis Act. “The purpose of the Ellis Act is to help ensure that the city has naturally affordable rental units in neighborhoods all around San Jose. We want to make sure that those naturally occurring, more affordable rental units are not taken off the market unnecessarily.”

But Susan Price-Jang, a local housing advocate and landlord, said the city’s Ellis Act should apply.

“I think it should be challenged, if someone says it doesn’t apply,” Price-Jang said Monday. “I think we should challenge this. These are not separate houses. They all have the same address, just as though they are apartments.”

https://sanjosespotlight.com/is-banning-single-family-zoning-possible-in-san-jose/,['San Jose'],Is banning single-family zoning possible in San Jose?,"As more cities across the country are scrapping single-family zoning laws to address a nationwide affordable housing crunch, San Jose says it’s not ready to take the plunge.

Owning a home — the legacy that defined American postwar democracy — is an ideal that is being challenged today as many cities opt for alternative solutions to provide easier access to housing.

Now that ideal no longer seems a reality for many, as housing has become an exorbitant expense. So cities such as San Jose say they need to address the region’s growing housing crisis by investing in building denser housing — fast — and doing away with the sprawl of single-family homes.

In San Jose, 94 percent of the city is zoned for single-family homes, differing significantly from other California cities such as San Francisco, which is at 37 percent and Los Angeles at 75 percent.

San Jose is focusing on executing its general four year review plan, dubbed by city officials as the city’s preamble to SB50, a statewide bill that was shelved earlier this year aimed at streamlining housing production around transit corridors.

While the plan is focused on creating denser housing in urban corridors — there’s a catch.

“There has been this concern about the impact of the redevelopment of the single-family character,” said Michael Brilliot, deputy director of the city’s planning department.

According to Brillot, San Jose is “pretty much built out,” and has been done building single-family homes for more than 15 years — unlike other cities in the country.

“We don’t have a lot of vacant land left. But we need to densify,” added Brillot. “We need to transform the suburban city into a more urban place. So the bargain was, we’re going to develop high-density housing around our urban corridors but in exchange for that we’re going to add policies that further preserve our existing single-family homes.”

That means the city will not allow a developer to go into a residential neighborhood, buy four or five different properties and knock them down to build taller developments in that same neighborhood. Instead, San Jose aims to allow dense developments only in certain corridors, particularly around commercial streets and transportation.

San Jose officials are not looking to ban single-family zoning altogether as other major cities, such as Minneapolis, Seattle and for the first time the entire state of Oregon, are attempting to do.

Minneapolis effectively ended single-family zoning by opening up all residential neighborhoods to multi-unit housing, while in Seattle, sweeping changes upzoned 27 residential neighborhoods, allowing for taller and denser buildings. In both cases, developers can build multi-unit residences in neighborhoods that were previously only designated for single-family homes.

Other cities in the Bay Area are looking to follow in these footsteps, as San Francisco said it’s exploring rezoning in single-family neighborhoods and Oakland’s Mayor Libby Schaaf has endorsed the idea.

While San Jose officials recognize the trend, many still say it’s not the right solution for the region. Instead, Mayor Sam Liccardo supports banning single-family developments near commercial corridors and transportation hubs — not citywide.

“Let’s face it — most of the Bay Area is still suburban,” Liccardo said in a panel to other local mayors last week. “You got lots of family housing and you’re not going to bulldoze it to go build apartments, at least not if you don’t want them to burn down City Hall.”

Although Liccardo supports protecting the character of existing suburban neighborhoods, he isn’t opposed to up zoning in certain neighborhoods where it makes sense. Allowing the construction of “medium-density” buildings such as duplexes, triplexes or fourplexes in between urban villages and residential spaces can provide “a more gradual transition,” he said.

In most American cities, preserving the suburban ideal is vital, as 75 percent of them prohibit building anything other than a single family home in residential spaces. Most of San Jose’s zoning is single-family, so if rezoning isn’t an option right now, city officials are turning to other solutions to build.

For neighborhoods where single-family homes are inevitable, the mayor proposed a program that incentivizes homeowners to build secondary granny units and rent them out to low-income families. In exchange, homeowners will get forgivable loans and some of the costs covered by the city .

“So you’re dealing with a lot of single family housing — we got to figure out ways to get the housing on those parcels,” added Liccardo.

While the mayor hopes this idea catches on, some experts say outreach efforts are essential in promoting any new kind of housing proposal — especially those that challenge single-family housing.

“For this to even occur in San Jose, it will require an immense amount of true community engagement,” said Michelle Huttenhoff, San Jose’s policy director for SPUR. “I think people resist change because they’re concerned, they’re fearful. The unknown is just concerning. It is more important than ever to have a strong civic engagement communication, strategy, and policy from a city level.”

According to Huttenhoff, SPUR is advocating that the city create a team solely focused on community engagement that will go beyond the minimal requirement to inform residents about potential developments in a neighborhood.

But not all residents agree that this would do much. Many don’t see how building more high-density housing in their neighborhoods could solve the region’s crisis. Some residents are worried that new developments can “skyrocket” prices, change the “small neighborhood” feel and stretch limited community resources.

“How are you going to justify all of this high-density housing bringing more people into the city to sleep, but not work?” said Elizabeth Estensen, president of the Willow Glen Neighborhood Association. “That hurts the entire city because it puts more pressure on roads, on travel. Our sewer system, our water — all of that is going to be impacted.”

But despite what city officials say, Estensen said she sees “several, several complexes” being built in otherwise single-family home neighborhoods like Willow Glen.

Still, Estensen said that granny units are a solution that residents “would respond well to.”

“I’m born and raised here, my children are sixth generation Willow Glen, and granny units have always been something that people have rented out,” said Estensen. ” I think it’s positive.”

https://www.archpaper.com/2019/09/google-san-jose-transit-village/,['San Jose'],Google reveals the future of its San Jose Transit Village,"In a San Jose, California, community meeting on August 22, Google revealed its plans for the San Jose Transit Village. The mile-long village along the former industrial area west of Highway 87 is anticipated to house 5.5 million square feet of office space for the tech company, 3,000 to 5,000 housing units, a combined 500,000 square feet of space for retail, culture, and education, and 15 acres of green spaces. The proposed plan holds the potential to provide employment for 20,000 to 25,000 people.

The project’s goal is to create an urban hub centered around people rather than cars, with paths connecting various plazas and green spaces in Google’s (and planners SITELAB Urban Studio’s) Framework Plan. At the heart of the village is the extant Diridon Station, which has become one of the largest transit hubs on the west coast. The station not only services San Jose but also functions as a transit hub for Santa Clara County and Silicon Valley. As part of the San Jose Diridon Station Area Plan, the stop is planned to incorporate a VTA light rail and BART extension to the available services.

Google and Trammell Crow, a Texan private commercial real-estate developer and investor, have spent over a year acquiring privately owned land in the area. Last November, Google negotiated the sale of 10.5 acres of publicly owned property around Diridon Station for $109.87 million. Google’s proposal offers a complete transformation of the area and an exchange of the traditional closed-off corporate tech campus design for an open concept plan that welcomes the community.

Alexa Arena, Google’s director of real estate development, insisted that both Google workers and San Jose residents want to emerge from the station directly into a vibrant city. San Jose’s director of economic development, Kim Walesh, agreed with Arena’s sentiments, and told Mercury News, “They have designed a district that meets their office needs but that is going to feel like an extension of the downtown…and like a very high-quality, regular urban area, I think that must be a first.”

The Framework Plan map released at the San Jose meeting provides a clear idea of the company’s vision. As for the design, the intention is to preserve some of the industrial characteristics of the San Jose neighborhood in the north portion of the village and focus on local retail and landscape in the south.

Following the current plans for project development, Google will receive feedback from the San Jose residents and refine their plans for city application in October. San Jose’s City Council will then formally review the project and take a final vote in fall of 2020, potentially allowing for a portion of the project to open by 2024.",[]
https://www.sanjoseinside.com/news/developer-proposes-turning-lidos-nightclub-building-into-office-retail-space/,['San Jose'],A look inside San Jose politics and culture,"A developer has submitted plans to tear down the former site of Lido’s Nightclub in downtown San Jose. In a preliminary proposal given to the city’s planning department last week, San Jose-based developer Urban Catalyst said it wants to redevelop the building on 30 S. First St.—known as the Lido Building—into a 76,000-square-foot mixed-use project comprising office and ground-floor retail space.

The plans also include the historic Knox Goodrich Building next door. While preserving much of the building’s historical structure, the developer wants to make it building part of the lobby of the new building.

Josh Burroughs, Urban Catalyst’s COO and SVP of development, told San Jose Inside he doesn’t yet know what tenants will occupy the building. But the company is hoping to attract small and medium-sized businesses, he said.

“We really want to be a catcher’s mitt for businesses that might be pushed out from some of the larger projects downtown,” he said.

Urban Catalyst hopes to start construction by April 2021.

The development, called Fountain Alley, is being followed closely because of its ties to a new federal tax program. If approved, the development would be San Jose’s first “opportunity zone” project. Opportunity zones are regions around the country that offer tax breaks to investors who put money into those areas.

Real estate investors and developers have been particularly excited about the opportunity zone program, which was part of the tax bill signed into law last year by President Donald Trump. The tax break applies to investors who put capital gains—the profit made from the sale of stock or property—into funds that support development.

The idea is to encourage development in places that haven’t historically seen it, although there have been some concerns it may speed up gentrification.

Burroughs said that proposing a project in an opportunity zone makes finding money to build the project much easier because there’s an added incentive for investors.

“It gives us a whole new group of potential investors to invest in real estate,” he said. “It’s a whole new tranche of money.”

Downtown is beginning to see a host of new developments, as developers hope to take advantage of Google’s incoming campus and the extension of BART to the area. “We want to expedite the vision for downtown San Jose that’s already in place,” Burroughs said.",[]
https://sanjosespotlight.com/san-jose-to-tackle-anti-displacement-amid-concerns-of-developers-on-panel/,['San Jose'],San Jose to tackle anti-displacement amid concerns of developers on panel,"Amid the region’s housing crunch and an increasing homeless population, San Jose is searching for solutions to temper the ongoing crisis, as more families and communities of color are subject to displacement.

In response, the City Council on Tuesday will discuss anti-displacement strategies to curb the adverse effects of Silicon Valley’s economic boom.

“The City Council’s study session on displacement in San Jose will provide a venue for councilmembers to learn more about the issue of displacement and about anti-displacement strategies that cities can employ,” said Housing Director Jacky Morales-Ferrand. “The project uses community-centered and data driven research to understand gentrification, displacement, and to help identify policy interventions that support equitable development.”

The city will discuss strategies that are rooted in the “three P’s” of housing policy — production, protection and preservation. Currently San Jose has a few policies to mitigate displacement, including an inclusionary housing ordinance that requires developers to set aside affordable units or pay a fee, long-term ground leases for affordable developments and tenant protections.

Still, 40 percent of the city’s population is at risk of being displaced, according to housing officials, the majority of whom are Latino, African American and Vietnamese.

According to the city’s study on urban displacement, nearly half of San Jose households are considered low-income, while only 23 percent of homes in the city are considered “affordable” or “rent stabilized.” A whopping 77 percent of the city’s housing stock is market rate, making displacement among some communities challenging to avoid. The city reports that displaced residents are more likely to become homeless, couch-surf or have new, long commutes.

To combat these alarming rates of displacement, city officials recommend acquiring private land and building affordable, high-density housing near transit, securing new funding for affordable housing projects and encouraging community land trusts in susceptible neighborhoods. They also suggested education on and enforcement of existing policies, and establishing a local living wage to provide long-term stability for those most at risk.

Matt King, a community organizer with Sacred Heart, said protections such as a right to legal counsel for tenants, reducing the current 5 percent rent cap on rent controlled units and expanding rent control to duplexes are important steps to curb displacement.

Criticism over landlord interests

Housing officials who will present the anti-displacement study Tuesday will be joined by representatives from top business organizations, such as the silicon valley organization and the California Apartment Association, a point of contention for many housing advocates.

They claim the landlords and business lobbies were added to the panel at the eleventh hour after a council committee chaired by Mayor Sam Liccardo twice voted to delay the anti-displacement study session.

Some of those developer and landlord representatives who will speak on displacement Tuesday include Jeff Zell, a property manager, and Shawn Milligan of KT Urban, a real estate development firm.

“Inviting developers and a landlord… makes it hard to believe this study session is an act of good faith,” King said. “We can only hope the mayor and councilmembers care more about the people they represent than the people who fill their campaign coffers. In November, the mayor wants to dismantle our Ellis Act policy and make it easier to bulldoze affordable housing for luxury apartments. That is a failure of leadership. With political courage and a bold agenda we can keep people in their homes.”

As a landlord in Mountain View, Zell had refused to comply with rent control after it was approved by voters in 2016 in an act of “civil disobedience,” instead sending a letter to his tenants claiming that he planned on increasing the rent and evicting tenants who didn’t pay up. Housing advocates say developer KT Urban has been heavily involved in lobbying against the Ellis Act, a protection that many housing advocates say is crucial to preventing displacement.

Housing officials on Tuesday will also discuss displacement strategies adopted by other cities and discuss whether those strategies would be feasible in San Jose. The city will publish its report on anti-displacement in November.

Planning Commission appointment

Also on Tuesday, the City Council will appoint two new commissioners to the city’s Planning Commission.

For the last few months, the city’s East Side community has been up in arms over the appointment of a new commissioner –former Councilmember Pierluigi Oliverio — after he was chosen to replace Ada Marquez, making him the fourth member on the 7-panel commission from affluent District 6.

When the second vacancy opened after John Leyba’s departure, City Clerk Toni Taber said no new applicants would be considered. A week later, a fourth entrant was added to the mix of applicants.

The four contenders include Mariel Caballero, a Santa Clara County deputy director at the probation department; Louis Barocio, vice principal at a East Side Union High School District; business owner Rolando Bonilla; and attorney George Casey.

The drawn out saga has attracted intense scrutiny from both sides of the political aisle, especially raising red flags from minority groups who are demanding more representation on the powerful commission.

Last week, SOMOS Mayfair and Councilmember Magdalena Carrasco held a news conference decrying the lack of transparency over the fourth entrant — Casey — and highlighting concerns over racial representation on the influential panel ahead of Tuesday’s decision.

“Our job is making sure that we do what we can to represent our districts,” Carrasco said during the news conference. “At the end of the day, we have to have a bigger, much broader, diverse and well represented vision, which is an inclusive vision.”

Fireworks ordinance

City leaders are brainstorming new strategies to curb the use of illegal fireworks and displays, following years of complaints from San Jose residents fed up with the dangerous sparklers.

On Tuesday, city officials will receive an update on the city’s fireworks ordinance, which intends to provide stronger solutions for enforcement of the city’s ban.

The city in recent years has beefed up enforcement for illegal fireworks by using a new reporting system for the public to report illegal activity through a phone line and online tool. Yet, the city is still experiencing problems with the system and its reliability.

As of this year, only 42 percent of the tool’s users reported that it was easy to use, according to a city report. This past year, a total of 1,946 online reports were received, but only 161 were considered “actionable.” During Fourth of July, a total of 787 calls were made, but only 68 were answered.

While the city struggles to deploy additional police officers to handle fireworks complaints, the department seized 300 pounds of illegal fireworks this past July and has increased its presence in neighborhoods where fireworks are reported the most.

A total of 464 calls were received during the Fourth of July period last year.

“The city has made major progress on all components of the program, however, there continues to be blatant illegal use of fireworks within the city limits,” said San Jose Fire Chief Robert Sapien. “The team continues to develop methods to define, gather, normalize and track data that can be used to make program adjustments and/or develop policy changes.”

Sapien said improving the online tool so that users can accurately report a complaint with a potential tutorial video may help make the process more efficient, in addition to increasing the number of public safety officers when suspected fireworks use might be high. The chief also suggested continuous education and outreach to help curb the use and sale of illegal fireworks.

The City Council will meet 1:30 p.m. Tuesday inside the council chamber at City Hall, 200 East Santa Clara Street in San Jose.

https://www.austinmonitor.com/stories/2020/08/study-pushes-city-toward-using-data-results-in-plans-to-address-homelessness/,['Austin'],"Study pushes city toward using data, results in plans to address homelessness - Austin Monitor","The city and organizations working to solve homelessness will adopt a more data-heavy approach to achieving the goals of the 2018 Action Plan to End Homelessness. The move to handle contracts for homeless services in a results-focused way is expected to quickly bring about investments in permanent housing from foundations and private businesses.

A recent summary of a study conducted by consultant Barbara Poppe and Associates notes that the city lacks a strong management approach in its efforts to combat homelessness, which negatively impacted decisions on setting priorities from the action plan, securing investments to remedy homelessness and measuring the results of those investments.

As a result of the study, the new Public-Private Partnership Task Force to End Homelessness was formed and is meeting weekly to create a data-driven plan for adding permanent supportive housing and other resources. Member organizations of the task force include the city of Austin and Ending Community Homelessness Coalition as well as the Downtown Austin Alliance, Caritas of Austin, Front Steps, Integral Care, LifeWorks, and the Salvation Army.

Matt Mollica, executive director of ECHO and co-chair of the task force, said one of the existing hurdles to using data for planning around homelessness was that programs from different organizations measured many kinds of data in non-uniform ways, which made it difficult to gauge their effectiveness and coordinate.

He said looking closely at metrics such as programs’ retention rate, tracking exits and where clients go after exiting a program, measuring increases in income through employment or benefits, and overall improvement in quality of life will help task force members improve their programs. The University of Texas’ LBJ School of Public Affairs will assist the task force in strengthening its use of data in executing its strategies.

“We know that we’re under-resourced on the federal, state and local level and we’ve seen massive disinvestment in resources to help people experiencing homelessness, so we’re trying to capitalize on the funding we do have available. It’s about helping projects be more impactful,” he said. “It’s about where we are getting the data, and are we using the Homeless Management Information System in the right way? Are we getting the same data so we can look at projects together and determine where there’s strengths and weaknesses? It’s not that data isn’t being collected, it’s that it’s not centralized and there’s an opportunity for creating and implementing data standards for programs that are aligned with best practices.”

The inclusion of groups aligned with the city’s business community and charitable foundations is expected to help spin up donations to add housing.

“They’re very excited about the alignment that’s occurring right now and documenting the shared vision … that’s something they’re very interested in being a part of,” Mollica said.

Among the next steps specified in the summary is “Continuing to undertake a proactive and inclusive approach to public space management with non-punitive policies.” That step could be impacted by a possible November ballot question that seeks to undo the city’s 2019 relaxation of restrictions on camping and occupying public spaces.

Mollica said recriminalizing homelessness would make it more difficult to find those who need help to secure permanent housing and other assistance to stabilize their lives.

“We know that it’s not a strategy and the criminalization of homelessness does not end homelessness … as folks are being pushed more to the fringes of our community through criminalization it makes it harder to engage those folks and that would impact the effectiveness of the strategy for sure.”

https://www.austinmonitor.com/stories/2020/08/city-to-loosen-enforcement-on-food-donation-charities/,['Austin'],City to loosen enforcement on food donation charities - Austin Monitor,"Covid-19 has increased food insecurity across Travis County while creating further operational complications for local food banks, soup kitchens and other charitable feeding organizations. To help meet the rising demand, the city is looking to remove some of its structural barriers that may limit the flexibility and reach of local food pantries.

Allen Schroeder, founder of local nonprofit Save the Food Austin, participated in a prior city-led working group on food salvage efforts. He told the Austin Monitor that the central barrier is that the city doesn’t allow food pantries to reportion large servings of food from restaurants or delis into smaller giveaway-sized portions, thus limiting their options and sources for food distribution.

“The city won’t allow that to happen inside of a pantry unless you have a kitchen permit and you have a certified food handler in that pantry, which is ridiculous, because, you know, who’s got that?” Schroeder said. “To be a certified kitchen you have to have a double sink, you have to have a mop sink, all your surfaces have to be stainless steel, you have to show that you’re running it like a kitchen. Pantries can’t do that.”

City Council approved a resolution Wednesday calling on the city manager to pause enforcement of any restrictions on food charities that do not impact community safety or health at least through the end of the year. The resolution also asks for a new task force to address other ways to amend and simplify the city’s Food Enterprise permitting process to encourage organizations to step in and offer their services.

Council’s request is a continuation of a previous effort by a 2019 working group of the Austin Travis County Food Policy Board, whose final recommendation requested such a task force to guide the permit revision process.

Only 24 percent of food recipient organizations in Austin and Travis County have gone through the process of receiving a food establishment permit in order to handle foods considered potentially hazardous. While no permit is required to donate pre-packaged dried foods like soup cans, cereal boxes or bottled water, donations of foods like cut tomatoes or melons, dairy products, fresh shell eggs, meats or cooked foods must be approved by the Austin/Travis County Health and Human Services Department.

The city holds charitable feeding organizations that deal with food requiring time and temperature control to the same standards as restaurants, but many food pantries are volunteer-led and lack the time and resources to complete the permit process. They often operate out of temporary borrowed spaces and have little authority to make physical changes to bring them up to city standards of a proper kitchen.

City of Austin food service permit fees range from $359-$896 depending on the size of the establishment and food risk category. The fee amounts are one of the factors the task force – made up of members of the Austin Travis County Food Policy Board, community stakeholders and city staffers – is asked to address in the coming months. Council has requested the group summarize its preliminary findings for the Oct. 27 work session and prepare a final report with any fee changes by Nov. 12.

Schroeder said he would be willing to join the task force if invited, although he works only in packaged goods and would not be directly impacted by the permit process revisions. While Save the Food supports relaxing restrictions on food pantries, the organization’s primary objective is to reduce food waste by partnering with local grocery stores to bring residents packaged foods that would otherwise be discarded.

In recent years, Schroeder has tried pressuring Austin Resource Recovery to encourage restaurants and grocery stores to donate food rather than composting, but said the effort has so far been “very complicated” and met with a lot of hesitancy from the city. “The food business here in Austin is very powerful. They don’t like politicians telling them what to do and to say that you have to put your food aside for a nonprofit to come and pick it up, that’s too invasive,” he said.

Driving tourists around the city as a Lyft ride-share driver, Strain, 56, said he doesn’t ever remember seeing so many new high-rise buildings, tourists walking around and homeless people sleeping on the streets.

Commuters fill the bridge trying to get into downtown Austin.

“When I went to school here so many years ago, Austin was a hidden gem,” Strain said as he drove a Bisnow reporter around the city. Strain lived in Newport Beach, California, before moving back to Austin to take care of a family member a year ago. “This was just a college town.”

Today, Austin is more than just a bunch of students who fill the University of Texas and surrounding colleges.

It is a bona fide metropolis.

Once known only for being Texas' state capital and for its “Keep Austin Weird” tag line, Austin in recent years has become a major tech hub and an attractive destination for those seeking an affordable lifestyle.

As the city grows, Austin, like other tech regions such as San Francisco and Los Angeles, is grappling with big-city problems — longtime residents are being displaced due to higher rent, traffic congestion is getting worse and there is a growing homeless problem, experts said.

“Austin has grown so furiously, so fast, in such a short amount of time,” Texas Standard Editor Terri Langford said Thursday at the National Association of Real Estate Editors conference in Austin. “With so much growth and housing prices skyrocketing, we’re pushing out the younger workforce and the diverse workforce to the outer edges. That’s something that Austin is slowly grappling with.”

Langford went to school at the University of Texas in the 1980s. She remembers when Austin was mostly a two-industry town — government and university.

Her return 15 years later surprised her.

“The whole skyline has changed,” Langford said.

Tech invading Austin is nothing new. The city has had a tech background for decades.

In the 1960s, defense electronics contractor Tracor, IBM and Texas Instruments set up headquarters in Austin. In the 1970s, Motorola and the University of Texas’ IC² Institute set up shop. In the 1980s, Microelectronics and Computer Consortium and Dell placed headquarters here, according to BuiltInAustin, an online community that supports tech startups in Austin.

Those tech companies have mostly come and gone.

Today, a new generation of tech companies is emerging.

The downtown skyline displays the names and logos of Google and Silicon Labs. Northwest of downtown, in the Domain mixed-use development, more than 3.4M SF of office space has been built or is under construction, according to the Statesman. Facebook, Amazon, HomeAway and Indeed have signed leases for office space and/or buildings, the Statesman reports.

In May, Apple announced it would lease a 93K SF building ahead of the construction of a $1B campus on a 133-acre site in North Austin.

The Austin-American Statesman's Shonda Novak said tech companies are moving in because of the higher-quality — and affordable — way of life. The median price of a single-family home — $407K — is an all-time high in Austin. The price is more than Houston, San Antonio and Dallas. But it is significantly cheaper than the median price for homes sold in Southern California in May: $530K, according to CoreLogic. In San Francisco, the average price of homes sold in May was $860K.

An average one-bedroom apartment could fetch $1,355 in Austin, according to apartment data site RentJungle. Meanwhile, the average rent for a one-bedroom in Los Angeles is $2,491 and $3,600 for San Francisco, RentJungle reports. Nationwide, the average rent price for an apartment is $1,442, according to RENTCafé.

“[Austin] really attracts a lot of people who were priced out of other big tech centers like San Francisco and LA,” Novak said. “They are having such a hard time [finding] housing [in other cities] that they are flocking here.

“For companies in the East and West Coast, they consider us a bargain.”

Bisnow/Joseph Pimentel

As tech companies move in, people are following. Austin's well-known live music scene, festivals and counterculture idealism have attracted people looking for the American dream.

It was downtown Austin — inside The Armadillo World Headquarters — where Willie Nelson made a name for himself.

It was Austin where a homeless cross-dressing eccentric, Leslie Cochran, ran for mayor three times — finishing second once — and captured the hearts of Austinites. Cochran embodied Austin's famous ""Keep Austin Weird"" saying and a statue is being erected in his honor.

Lured by affordability, the eclectic lifestyle and Austin’s natural beauty, people are coming in droves.

The city — the most liberal major metro in the state — has become one of the fastest-growing cities in the country. From 2017 to 2018, about 145 people a day were moving to Austin, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

In 2010, there were a little more than 800,000 people living in Austin, according to the U.S. census. By 2018, the population ballooned 20% to 964,000 people.

The city's job market is thriving — largely due to the tech industry — and that is one of the reasons for the influx of new residents, according to USA Today.

Austin’s population is expected to hit 1 million by next year.

As new residents move in, longtime residents are being displaced.

In the past five years, rent has grown by 17.2%, compared to the national average of 13%, according to Curbed Austin, citing a study on Apartment List.

A Freddie Mac report released in June found that only 18% of new apartment units built after 2010 were for very low income households. Prior to 2010, 35% of units built were for very-low-income residents.

“What’s most concerning is that the loss in affordable housing units happened even though Austin’s supply of multifamily housing grew,” Freddie Mac Vice President of Multifamily Research Steve Guggenmos said to HousingWire. “Nearly a quarter of Austin’s units were built after 2009 and a high percentage of these new units are not affordable for very-low-income renters. Like a lot of cities, they just can’t keep up.""

Austin’s homeless situation is getting worse. The number of homeless people in the city reached 2,255, up 5% from the previous year, according to CBS Austin.

Last month, the Austin City Council approved a new $8.6M 100-bed homeless shelter. The city is also allowing homeless people to sit, sleep and set up tents on the sidewalk or any public areas as long as they are not blocking a pathway.

Texas Gov. Greg Abbott tweeted he plans to override the council's ruling.

As Austin boomed, builders didn't provide enough affordable housing stock for low-income renters.

Lyft driver Jose Gutierrez, 36, moved to Austin three years ago. Originally from Laredo, Gutierrez said she has noticed rent going up and gentrification seeping in.

""You see them on the streets,"" Gutierrez said, referring to homeless people. ""There are some people being displaced because of all these new developments. But I hope the developments won't too severely impact longtime residents.""

Michele Sandoval, 63, an information technology project coordinator, moved to Austin eight years ago to start over after getting a divorce.

Sandoval said she loves living in the city.

""People are nice and there are so many things to do,"" Sandoval said.

But she also noticed the influx of new residents.

""It's crazy,"" she said. ""They can't build housing fast enough.""

Asked if Austin can keep it weird, she said only if the new residents embrace the city's eclectic culture.

Writer's Workshop Director and author Ron Seybold has lived in Austin for 41 years. Seybold recalls a time when the city's popular Dirty Sixth Street was a collection of skid row dive bars.

Some of the areas around downtown were fruit stands where farmers sold peaches, he said.

The single-family homes in Northwest Austin were selling for $40K and it was so new, Seybold said, tarantulas and scorpions were commonplace.

Seybold predicts as more people come to live in Austin, it will get harder for young families to find an affordable house within the city. He said housing is Austin's No. 1 problem.

""They are going to move out and further away from the city,"" Seybold said. ""We're on a trajectory here to keep people out that don't have economic wherewithal to get started. I don't see them fixing the housing problem in the next 10 years.""

However, Seybold does like the influx of new residents and jobs. It is a bit of a Catch-22.

""The world is coming to Austin,"" Seybold said. ""There's plenty of talent, imagination and passion. ... This is a beautiful place, with a progressive mindset. I think there's a nice interaction of ideas here that have been established and those that can make those better.""",[]
https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/11/18260154/austin-scooters-bird-lime-uber-jump-sxsw-2019-dangerous-future-urban-transit,['Austin'],"A cyclone of scooters has descended on Austin for SXSW, for better or worse","Last Saturday night, for the first time in my four years of attending SXSW, I thought I was going to die. I crossed the road at the pedestrian crosswalk next to the Austin Convention Center, and four people — each traveling approximately 15 miles per hour on electric scooters — darted around me.

Not only did I not see or hear them coming — the mostly silent scooters have lights that automatically activate at night, but they can still be hard to spot in the dark — but I also had no idea what the best course of action was. I simply froze in place, standing in the middle of the street as the scooter riders whizzed by, having the time of their lives. Would I have died if struck? Probably not, and a motor vehicle in the same situation would have been a much graver threat. But in that moment, I felt genuine fear. My heart rate spiked, and for moments afterward, I felt shaken up and on high alert, wary of the countless other scooter riders that could be one mistake away from sending me to the emergency room.

This situation likely sounds familiar to any of the hundreds of thousands of festival attendees at this year’s SXSW, the annual tech, music, film, and marketing meetup. The scooters, nonexistent at last year’s festival, are everywhere in Austin this week, with thousands of vehicles concentrated in the roughly 1.5-square-mile area stretching from the Texas Capitol to the intersecting Colorado River. The result is attendees operating them at high speeds both through dense crowds on the sidewalk and among busy automobile street traffic. No one is wearing a helmet. And messy heaps of scooters are scattered across Austin’s sidewalks and public spaces.

Some of the astounding sights I’ve seen in the past few days include multiple vicious-looking wipeouts, a man cranking the accelerator and doing donuts in a crowded parking lot, and scooters littering the gutters of East 6th Street while throngs of people avoid tripping over them. At one point, I read that a man was found riding one down the shoulder of an Austin highway. Riders here are disregarding all manner of street signage and traffic lights; some people flagrantly speed the wrong way down streets.

Multiple police checkpoints litter the edges of off-limits areas — Austin has made certain that popular blocks, like downtown’s Rainey Street, are no-scooter zones — so officers can herd hundreds of scooters into makeshift parking lots. And yet, I’ve never seen so many people so thoroughly enjoying themselves as they maneuver from panels to parties, bars, and restaurants. Perhaps the recklessness is part of the fun, but even a cursory Twitter search turns up innumerable scooter evangelists who’ve been converted by their time in Austin.

Scooters have been messy from the jump. Bird first dumped its scooter fleet into the Santa Monica area of Los Angeles in fall 2017. Since then, municipal governments and the general public have been dealing with the injury risks, urban cultural effects, and makeshift regulatory environment surrounding the scooter movement, which has ballooned into a multibillion-dollar industry.

The SXSW scooter situation is a fitting experiment that shows us what cities may look like in five years

The scooters first arrived in Austin last April when the city declared itself a hub for experimentation with “micromobility,” a buzzwordy euphemism for rentable bikes and scooters designed to take you short distances. In the ensuing 11 months, Bird, Lime, Uber-owned Jump, Lyft, and Spin, among other smaller ventures, have happily moved in.

Here in Austin during SXSW, the large-scale scooter deployment is thanks to the city’s 10 licensed operators, each with permits that allow 500 vehicles in downtown Austin. The result is a fascinating test case in how the micromobility trend fares in an extremely dense, highly populated area with unfettered access to electric vehicles at all times.

Over the years, SXSW has shifted its tech focus away from mobile apps to far-future subjects like AI, self-driving cars, and cryptocurrencies. Its significance as a gathering of celebrities, executives, and industry experts has waned since the days when it helped kickstart Twitter; now, it mostly exists as a place for brands to self-promote and employees to party every night and gorge on tacos. But it’s still a destination for, at the very least, finding out what the biggest people in media, tech, and Hollywood think might be The Next Big Thing, even if that thing is inevitably a failure.

Now, the scooter explosion feels like the most talked-about development the show has seen since live-streaming app Meerkat broke onto the scene here in 2015. For a festival that bills itself as a peek into the future, the scooter frenzy is a remarkably fitting experiment that shows us what cities might look like five or 10 years from now. The answer so far: equal parts urban transit nightmare and genuinely transformative social change.

Last year’s SXSW brought an influx of more than 430,000 people to Austin, with a vast majority of people concentrated in the downtown area near the city’s convention center. Although Austin suspended licensing for adding new dockless electric vehicles to the mix back in January, while it reassesses its current contracts, that’s still left more than 17,500 licensed electric vehicles on city streets. Most of the scooter companies appear to have moved a majority of their fleets to downtown to capitalize on the opportunity.

With that many available, it’s no wonder that attendees seem to love the scooters. (They wouldn’t be a controversial subject if they sat unused, after all.) The process of getting around downtown for panels and attending events and parties used to be a slog from a series of hotels to the convention center and back, resulting in some turbulent history in recent years around regulating Uber and Lyft. Now, thanks to the scooters, it’s a brief and often enjoyable ride that saves you time and can cost as little as 50 cents.

Bird, Lime, and Uber are allowing Austin residents to use the vehicles free of charge to start, with a cost of just 15 cents per minute after that. In other markets, the companies tend to charge a flat fee of either $1 or sometimes $2.50, depending on whether you’re using a scooter or a bike. What that says about the sustainability of companies like Bird and Lime is not immediately clear. After charging and maintenance costs, as well as the money spent fishing scooters out of lakes and freeing them from impound lots, most scooter companies are left with a small fraction of each ride, while some actually lose money. Regardless, both Bird and Lime have earned valuations of around $2 billion each.

Fun and cheap as they may be, scooters come with serious risks. Traveling at that speed, a scooter rider may seriously injure themselves or a pedestrian, and using one in traffic without a bike lane to protect you, as the law requires, means you may be mowed down by an automobile. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention even launched the first study of electric scooter accidents at the request of Austin’s Public Health and Transportation departments. Speaking with local publication Hilltop Views last week, an emergency room nurse at the city’s St. David’s Medical Center said that the institution admits around 50 people per week with electric scooter injuries.

Scooters are so easy and cheap that the public is embracing them, despite the risks

Meanwhile, cities are now grappling with large-scale scooter deployments that drastically affect sidewalks, public spaces, and roads. That’s all while the existence of low-cost, venture capital-funded scooters make it much less likely that public transportation like rail and bus networks receive the necessary funding and support required to improve — or even function.

The scooter companies appear to be trying to make amends for their irresponsible beginnings. Uber-owned Jump is giving out helmets to any SXSW attendee who requests one, although I have yet to see a helmet rack. Jump also requires you to now take a photo of your scooter after you park it to ensure you’re not leaving it somewhere especially egregious, although that seems to be doing little to curb bad behavior.

“To prepare for the increase in demand, we have ramped up our team on the ground who are available 24/7 to move any incorrectly parked scooters or bikes to the designated parking areas,” an Uber spokesperson said in a statement given to The Verge. “We are also in regular communication with the city and will continue to work with them to help quickly address any issues.” The company says it has a ground team dealing with the helmet issue as well as “providing resources to encourage riders to follow the rules of the road,” although that seems unsuccessful.

Lyft, to its credit, says it’s built the first on-the-ground scooter parking stations in Austin specifically to help “calm the chaos” of SXSw, a spokesperson told The Verge. The company also launched what it calls a “scootiquette” program to educate riders on best practices and how to follow the law. The program even comes with a flashy, illustration-heavy infographic designed to inform people about permitted and prohibited scooter use.

Scooter companies are experimenting with parking stations and financial incentivizes

Bird declined to comment specifically on SXSW, but it did point The Verge to Austin’s John-Michael V. Cortez, special assistant to the mayor, who did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Prior to the event, Austin Transportation Director Robert Spillar said, “I’m not really worried about it,” when speaking about the scooter situation at SXSW last week with local NBC affiliate KXAN-TV. ”When I talk to my peers in other cities, they are just mesmerized with our very positive experience with this new, shared mobility technologies here in Austin,” Spillar added. “We’ve done way over a million rides here in Austin since we introduced them, and that’s just huge — that is people not in cars traveling.”

Additionally, Bird says it developed a battle plan for SXSW that was improved over time thanks to past experiments during the Austin City Limits Music Festival and in Atlanta during the Super Bowl. That involves partnering with hotels to create more ample sidewalk parking, working with the city to enforce the no-ride zones, and deploying a ground team to operate 24 hours a day to ensure that as little goes wrong as possible.

Similarly, Lime says it’s using in-app notifications and guides to help riders use the scooters safely, and it’s working with the city of Austin to issue fines for parking or riding in no-scooter zones. Lime is also incentivizing riders to park in designated areas by giving away discounts. Neither Bird nor Lime, however, would comment on the sidewalk clutter or rule-breaking that seems rampant this week at SXSW, with both companies reiterating that use in-app reminders and other methods of communication to ensure riders follow the rules and, if all else fails, defer to local police.

While there’s only been one panel that’s explicitly designed around scooters, much of the substantive discussion here at SXSW feels relevantly centered on policy — in particular, policy that may rein in tech platforms. “Moving fast and breaking things,” Facebook’s infamous early motto, is decidedly out of style.

That means that part of the blowback from scooter companies has to do with how they cribbed, in part, from the playbook of Facebook and more prominently from the playbook of Uber and Lyft, by dumping electric vehicles into city streets without permission. At one Oakland meeting about scooters, the companies blamed parents for children riding the scooters — even though no effort had been made to educate parents about whether children should use them before the vehicles were scattered all over the sidewalks.

Moving from a web service or software product into the real world comes with a higher level of scrutiny. Bird and Lime are in the process of establishing better relationships with cities around the globe. In doing so, we might see improvements to safety, urban clutter, and the other issues that make scooters so polarizing that people toss them into lakes. Yet at SXSW, the snapshot of the future we’re getting is one more prone to chaos than order — at least until a more peaceful equilibrium is reached between cities and scooter companies.

Unlike a mobile app, the stakes with electric vehicles are life and death. If Austin this week is any indication of what’s to come, scooters will inevitably arrive everywhere in short order, and the public will love them just enough to ignore the consequences. We just need to be prepared for what comes next.

Update 3/11, 3:30PM ET: Added additionally information from Lyft about its scooter parking stations in Austin and a new education program around scooter etiquette.

While Austin continues to be one of the fastest growing cities in the USA, that growth has also impacted mobility in the city. The average driver, for example, now spends more than 50 hours in traffic a year, and as the city continues to grow and evolve, the need for new mobility solutions will continue to be apparent. Locally, city leaders are looking to make it easier for people living in all parts of Austin to access the services and resources required for living a healthy life. The City:One Challenge is designed to complement the city’s efforts by facilitating a collaborative process with the community, offering residents the opportunity to share their experiences and suggest ideas for how to solve their most pressing mobility problems. The goal is to help improve the quality of life for residents and visitors through dynamic mobility options that complement the existing transportation system.

Ford and the Austin Transportation Department’s Smart Mobility team will explore citizen’s transportation needs and collaborate on new solutions. Throughout the eight-month City:One Challenge program, those who live, work and play in Austin are invited to explore dynamic mobility options focused on their requirements. Ford and Challenge collaborators, including sponsors AT&T, Dell Technologies and Microsoft, will also assist with the community collaboration process. Following a series of community workshops, the public, businesses, startups and innovators can begin submitting ideas for new mobility solutions during the application period at the end of August. In October, a committee of city officials, community stakeholders and corporate collaborators will select 12 finalists to attend a prototyping session and receive mentoring support to refine their schemes before submitting a final pilot proposal. Finally, a panel of judges will award up to US$100,000 to fund pilots to test the top proposed solutions.

Ford originally launched its City Challenge program in 2018 in Pittsburgh (Pennsylvania), Miami-Dade County (Florida) and Grand Rapids (Michigan). The three challenges resulted in ongoing pilots addressing issues ranging from long, inefficient student pickup lines at schools to safer transportation methods for night shift workers who must travel during non-traditional hours. Austin is the fourth city to launch the City:One Challenge this year, following previous announcements in Indianapolis, Detroit and Mexico City. Each challenge is tailored to the specific city or county and is focused on addressing its unique needs.

“To truly solve problems that affect the way people move in our cities, we believe it’s imperative to encourage all residents to take part in the process, identify serious issues, and propose solutions that lead to greater access for everyone,” said Jeff Jones, vice president of Ford City Solutions. “With the City:One Challenge, our goal is to engage people on a personal level, to really understand the unique issues that affect their day-to-day lives, as we look for solutions that have a real chance to improve their experiences.”",[]

The Texas city of Austin has become the first in the nation to approve funding for abortion access services, abortion advocates said this week.

The city council approved $150,000 in its 2020 budget to help cover transportation, lodging and child care for women seeking abortions. The move made Tuesday faces a lawsuit and follows a new state law banning cities from paying for abortions.

Austin Mayor Pro Tem Delia Garza said the funding can break down barriers to abortion in the wake of state and federal restrictions, such as the Trump administration rule that bans clinics from referring women for abortions. This month in Texas, Senate Bill 22 began to bar contracts between abortion providers and government entities.

“I don’t make decisions based on what the legislature wants, I make decisions based on what our community needs,"" Garza said Tuesday, the Austin American-Statesman reported.

Fewer women are having abortions: Why? Is a decline desirable?

Former councilmember Don Zimmerman filed a lawsuit to block the spending the next day, the newspaper reported, arguing it violates a 1961 state law making it a crime to help someone get an abortion. The Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision legalized the procedure 12 years after passage of that statute.

The author of Senate Bill 22, Republican Sen. Donna Campbell is also considering challenging Austin's support services funding through the Texas Attorney General’s office. In a statement, Campbell said she wasn't surprised the city “would manipulate the law (SB 22) to use taxpayer dollars to pay for transportation and lodging to those seeking an abortion.”

Sarah Lopez, a program coordinator for Fund Texas Choice, applauded Austin's move, noting it makes the capital of Texas the first U.S. city to provide practical, logistical support funding toward accessing abortion. In June, New York City became the first to directly fund abortions.

Abortion pills by mail: Some US women are taking reproductive matters into their own hands

No hearings have been scheduled for the lawsuit against Austin's funding, which does not cover abortion procedure expenses, the American-Statesman reported.

“They are always trying to put more money behind their ideological preferences,” Zimmerman told the newspaper. “The progressives are always trying to make taxpayers pay for their progressive ideologies.”

This new record price coincides with a drop in both new and active listings as well as a 3.4% drop in home sales in the city.

Surrounding areas, however, “experienced strong gains” in the same period, according to the report.

“A lack of middle-market housing in the city of Austin is driving demand to the suburbs,” ABoR President Kevin Scanlan said in a statement. “While the Central Texas housing market is healthy and thriving, Austin continues to struggle with housing options that are affordable for first-time homebuyers as the median price surpasses $400,000.”

Such expensive home prices have negatively affected Austin ISD, which has seen its enrollment drop by roughly 5,000 students over the last five years in a trend that is projected to continue.

Reyne Telles, executive director of communications and community engagement for the district, attributed the drop in enrollment in part to rising home prices.

“In order to adapt to this new reality and work toward increasing our student population, the school district now allows students who reside outside of AISD’s boundaries to transfer into our schools,” Telles said in a statement.

The district is also in the process of consolidating some of its campuses in an attempt to better use district resources.

Mobile technology company Kisi set out to determine which major U.S. cities offer the best work-life balance, and which ones could use an adjustment by examining work intensity, society and institutions, and livability. Overall, Austin ranks 10th-worst for work-life balance (No. 31 out of 40), but just as sobering is how overworked our residents are.

According to the study, Austin is one of the most overworked cities in the nation. Fifteen percent of Austin workers work at least 48 hours a week, the highest figure in the study, and, on average, the Austin workforce stays on the clock 43.5 hours a week, the third-longest in the country. Local workers arrive at work at 8:57 am but are on the road much earlier, commuting about 27 minutes just one way, the study says.

Austin falls toward the bottom of the list — No. 27 — for institutional and societal support. The city ranks low across the board, from healthcare and access to mental health to gender equality. However, Austin ranks higher than most cities for LGBTQ+ equality, at No. 19.

The Capital City redeems itself, though, for livability, No. 12, which takes into account overall happiness, safety, and access to wellness and leisure. This allowed Kisi to determine ""whether their residents can enjoy their environment after office hours,"" the study says.

In general, the Lone Star State could stand to improve its work-life balance. Houston ranks lowest in Texas, at No. 37, and is the second-most overworked place in the nation. Dallas and San Antonio also rank in the bottom 10, Nos. 32 and 31, respectively.

https://news.wjct.org/post/city-council-approves-jacksonville-emerald-trail-master-plan,['Jacksonville'],City Council Approves Jacksonville Emerald Trail Master Plan,"The groundwork has been approved by the Jacksonville City Council to create and connect 30 miles of trails in the urban core.

The Emerald Necklace has just been an idea for more than a century but our News4Jax partner reports the City Council has now adopted a plan to build the Emerald Trail within the next 10 years.

The resolution was approved March 26 to implement the master plan as part of Jacksonville's revitalization efforts at an estimated cost of $31 million for design and construction, not including land acquisition.

Groundwork Jacksonville has an agreement with the city to manage the design and permitting of the project and has committed to raising at least 50 percent of the design and permitting cost from private donors, grants and foundations. “The Groundwork Trust was established in Jacksonville to realize the Emerald Necklace and to build the public-private partnerships to make it possible,” says Kay Ehas, CEO of Groundwork Jacksonville. “We are proud to take this first giant step toward achieving that goal.”

According to Ehas, the next step will be to design and build the Model Project, a portion of the trail that will be highly utilized and will offer the community a tangible example of what the finished Emerald Trail can be. The 1.3-mile Model Project will connect the south end of the existing S-Line Rail Trail to the intersection of Park and Stonewall streets near the Convention Center. The goal is to have the project completed in 2020.

There are many advantages to this connection, including multiple access points for the LaVilla and Brooklyn neighborhoods, the opportunity to connect to the McCoys Creek Greenway in the future and the fact that no land acquisition is needed. The total cost for this first trail segment is projected to be $3.6 million. Groundwork is currently raising

$900,000, or 25 percent of the Model Project cost. For the balance of the funding, legislation will soon be introduced to move funds into the 2018-2019 Capital Improvement Projects (CIP) budget for design. Construction funds will be requested from City Council as part of the 2019-2020 CIP.

“As we look ahead at creating a vibrant and bustling downtown, I am pleased to have the City partner with Groundwork Jacksonville to increase pedestrian and bicycle access to our natural spaces,” said Mayor Lenny Curry. “Connecting communities and celebrating our neighborhoods is what the Emerald Trail project is all about. We are a city on the rise and this important project will be a big part of changing the landscape of our downtown as we move forward.”

When complete, the Emerald Trail will encompass 19.7 miles of new trails connecting at least 14 historic neighborhoods and downtown to existing and/or planned trail segments including the S-Line Rail Trail, Hogans Creek, McCoys Creek, the Northbank and Southbank riverwalks and the FDOTs Riverside connection to San Marco, for a total of 30 miles of trails and linear parks.

“The Emerald Trail will not only create unprecedented recreational opportunities in the urban core, it is a transformative transportation and economic redevelopment project,” said Ehas. Groundwork sees Jacksonville’s neighbor to the north as an example of the impact this project could have. “If you look at the Atlanta BeltLine, the direct economic impact is almost $4 billion thus far. We believe the Emerald Trail will deliver significant economic benefits to Jacksonville, as well,” Ehas added.

Groundwork Jacksonville developed the Emerald Trail Master Plan in collaboration with the PATH Foundation—the organization responsible for building more than 280 miles of trails in Georgia—and KAIZEN Collaborative, one of the Southeast’s leading trail planning and design firms.

Advocates believe the Emerald Trail will be a catalyst for social and economic opportunity in Jacksonville, from encouraging healthy lifestyles and promoting public safety, to spurring neighborhood revitalization and economic development. The trail will link to 18 schools, two colleges and 28 parks among other destinations like restaurants, retail and businesses, with an additional 20 schools and 21 parks located within three blocks of the trail.

“Everyone involved in revitalizing Jacksonville is looking for ways to create a more livable, walkable, recreational downtown to attract residents, visitors and business expansion to the urban core,” said Councilwoman Lori Boyer, District 5, a champion of downtown renewal and riverfront activation. “The Emerald Trail will help to accomplish this while also improving mobility and economic opportunity for those who currently live in the historic urban neighborhoods along the proposed trail.”

Emerald Trail Master Plan Tier 1

Tier 1 includes 6.8 miles of new trail at a cost of approximately $13.59 million:

Segment 1 - Model Project: South end of S-Line on State Street to the intersection of Park and Stonewall streets.

Segment 2 - Hogan Street Connector: Hogans Creek at 1st Street to the Northbank Riverwalk at the Landing.

Segment 3 - Southwest Neighborhood Connector: Artist Walk under I-95 to the south end of the McCoys Creek Greenway on Edison Avenue.

Segment 4 - S-Line Connector: Boulevard Street to East 21st Street.

Segment 5 - Hogans Creek Greenway: S-line near 12th Street to Hogans Creek Greenway at North Laura Street.



Emerald Trail Master Plan Tier 2

Tier 2 includes 14.1 miles of new trail at a projected cost of $17.44 million:

Segment 6 - Westside Connector: McCoys Creek Boulevard at Leland Street to Florida C. Dwight Memorial Playground.

Segment 7 - Northwest Connector: McQuade Street north of the active S-Line to Moncrief Road.

Segment 8 - Eastside Connector: North Liberty Street just south of East 13th Street to Hogans Creek Greenway south of the Arlington Expressway.

Segment 9 - Hogans Creek to Riverwalk: Hogans Creek Greenway at Laura Street to Northbank Riverwalk at Newnan Street.

Programmed trail segments are the proposed trail connections that have existing funding allocated for implementation. McCoys Creek Greenway, Artist Walk to Fuller Warren Bridge and the San Marco Connector are programmed segments that the Emerald Trail will connect to as part of the Master Plan.

With a grant from the U.S. Forest Service, Jacksonville has hired a Virginia-based nonprofit to study the city’s trees and how they can be better utilized to address the problems of urban stormwater runoff, among other things.

The city is hosting a public meeting on Thursday, February 28, where officials will discuss the study and seek input from residents. The event is scheduled to run from 6 to 8 p.m. at San Marco Preservation Hall, 1652 Atlantic Blvd.

The U.S. Forest Service funded studies in three Florida communities: Orange County, the City of Miami Beach and Jacksonville. Green Infrastructure Center Executive Director Karen Firehock said Jacksonville’s is the final project in the state, and her team is working to wrap up the study soon.

“Many cities in Florida are suffering from too much standing water and polluted runoff, as rainwater picks up pollutants on the streets and carries them into surface waters,” Firehock said. “This project is demonstrating how we can better utilize the city’s existing trees to capture stormwater and where we can plant new trees to also soak up additional water.”

Trees help because they capture and retain rainwater before allowing it to evaporate back into the atmosphere.

“What that does is it sort of intercepts some water. That’s less water that’s falling onto streets and running off and causing standing water, flooding and other problems,” explained Firehock.

She says the problem in older cities like Jacksonville is that much of the area is paved, meaning there’s not as much space for trees to grow. Additionally, the city’s tree canopy is getting old.

“So if you have a beautiful live oak tree but it’s been there for a long time, it might be getting toward the end of its life cycle,” she said. “So if we don’t plant new trees, we’re not going to have that canopy in the future.”

The urban tree canopy is the layer of tree leaves, branches and stems that provide tree coverage of the ground when viewed from above.

Researchers are using detailed satellite imagery to map Jacksonville’s canopy and to show where trees should be retained because they’re already effectively soaking up water, as well as places where additional trees should be planted to help with the stormwater problem.

According to Firehock, Jacksonville’s canopy average is currently at about 42 percent, meaning “if you were a bird flying over the city looking down, 42 percent of it would be covered by trees.”

But downtown the tree canopy drops dramatically to about 10 percent.

“It’s not evenly distributed, so we want to find those places in the city where trees are lacking and try to add them so they can soak up water,” said Firehock.

While trees play a significant role in reducing urban stormwater runoff and improving water quality, they provide other benefits as well.

Research from social scientist Kathleen Wolf suggests trees have socio-economic impacts like lowering crime rates, improving health, raising property values and they can even lead to people spending more time in shopping centers.

Plants also improve air quality and even help curb climate change and its impacts.

Trees absorb carbon dioxide, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and global warming.

Firehock said trees also help cool cities.

“You can find a difference of 12 degrees cooler under a tree versus out in the street,” she said. That also helps reduce energy costs. “It varies by area. It can be as much as 20 percent.”

As Jacksonville’s Urban Forest Manager Richard Leon puts it, trees are the answer to many of the city’s issues.

“That’s why I’m in this position,” he said. “I honestly believe that trees play a role in mitigating all these things.”

Leon said the study will help the city figure out if there are any codes or ordinances that could be changed to improve the condition of urban tree canopies.

The city will host its final meeting on the study in Springfield on March 28.

Firehock said it’s great that the city is sponsoring these workshops, but most of the land in Jacksonville is privately owned.

“The way we are going to be able to be most successful is if community members and businesses plant trees on their own properties,” she said. “That will be critical, because a tree survives best when it’s got enough room and space to grow, and the best place for a tree is really in somebody’s yard. We can get them to survive on streets, but really, if we can get participation by community members that will really help.”

Unlike the federally mandated Point-in-Time Count that takes place each January, the August Surge is a local initiative.

Changing Homelessness CEO Dawn Gilman said volunteers will be scouring Jacksonville’s urban core and the beaches.

""Not counting shelters, not counting transitional housing, we are very focused on who is outside, unsheltered or street homeless.""

Gilman says the summer census is a way for her organization to make sure homeless veterans identified in previous counts haven’t fallen through the cracks.

She says volunteers will also be on the lookout for homeless 18-to-24 year olds as well as unsheltered women and children.

""I just got an email from our homeless school liaison at Duval County Public Schools. School just started so they have found an unexpected number of families living in cars.""

The count is set for Tuesday, August 27 from 5:30 to 8:30 in the evening. Volunteers can sign up on the Changing Homelessness website.

In an effort to make Jacksonville green again, the 630-CITY Tree Planting Program is giving homeowners the ability to give back to the environment while beautifying their yards.

""People can call the city and request a tree be planted in their right of way and the trees come from the city's tree mitigation fund,"" said Richard Leon, the city's urban forest manager.

This new program is focused on reforesting urban areas.

""The goal is to get as many trees planted in the city of Jacksonville as we can,"" Leon said. ""When these trees get fully mature, you'll have a shaded sidewalk to walk your dogs down. You'll have a shaded street to park your car on. As foresters, we're always planting trees for the future.""

Joseph Jordan, a new homeowner in Springfield, is one of the first recipients of the new trees.

""It's exciting because our house is brand-new. We just moved down here,"" Jordan said. ""We have this oak tree in front of our house. It's probably 100 years old -- been here as long as you can remember -- so it's cool to see something start from small and be able to watch it grow over the years that we're here. So it's really neat.""

Homeowners can request up to two new trees to be planted in their yards, free of charge.

Keeping the trees watered is the responsibility of the homeowner.

The trees are planted with 35-gallon water bags around them. To make sure your tree is properly watered, the homeowner simply has to fill the bag of water up when it is running low.

The bill to bring the program to Jacksonville received unanimous support during a City Council meeting on Tuesday night. The proposal calls for about $765,000 in funding.

""I think the program has shown its value already,"" said City Councilman Bill Gulliford. ""We need to attack this thing (crime) at the ground level and that's what this thing (the bill) does.""

The assessment was performed between Feb. 18 - 21. Leaders spoke with hundreds in the community who gave feedback about the potential for reduced violence.

Damien Cook, from the Office of Grant and Contract Compliance, told the City Council that the hope is for immediate success, mirroring what happened in New York City, Chicago and Baltimore.

""This is going to get straight to the point of it and then work with all those other efforts that are working to try and reduce the violence,"" Cook said.

Cure Violence leaders were able to identify the hot spots for violent incidents. Over six of the the top 10 violent ZIP codes are in Zone 1, which includes Downtown, Springfield and the Eastside, and Zone 5, which includes Northwest Jacksonville, New Town and Baldwin.

The ten most violent ZIP codes, in no particular order, were identified as: 32202, 32205, 32206, 32208, 32209, 32210, 32211, 32218, 32244 and 32254.

If you’ve lived in Jacksonville for more than a few years and feel like it’s more crowded, you’re right.

The U.S. Census Bureau has a new report out that shows the city of Jacksonville’s population surged by an estimated 12,153 residents between 2017 and 2018. Jacksonville's estimated city population as of July 1, 2018 was 903,889.

The South and West continue to have the fastest-growing cities in the U.S., according to the new census estimates.

Phoenix topped of the list 15 cities with the largest population gains, with an increase of 25,288 people. Jacksonville is at the No. 7 spot. Miami is No. 15, with a gain of 8,884 people, bringing its city population up to 470,914.

In the South, the fastest growing cities in order of population growth were Austin, Texas; Jacksonville; Frisco, Texas; McKinney, Texas; and Miami.

In Jacksonville, the population boom has resulted in multifamily home construction's hitting an all-time high for new starts, with roughly 2,500 units begun since June 2018, according to real estate firm Colliers International’s 2018 year-end report.

Colliers predicted another record-setting year for 2019, with nearly 7,000 units under construction.

The Jacksonville metro area had 77,956 multifamily units in December, the Colliers’ report said, with a tight vacancy rate of 3.8% and an annual rent growth of 4.3%. The nation’s overall housing stock grew by 0.8%, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

Jacksonville International Airport also broke an 11-year-old record for passenger traffic in 2018 with 6,460,253 air travelers last year.

The Jacksonville Aviation Authority is seeking design bids for a new concourse to accommodate more passengers at the airport, which saw business grow 16% last year.

About 100 people gathered at Hemming Park in Downtown Jacksonville Friday to participate in a youth-led climate strike.

The event was part of a global movement to call for swift action on climate change.

Several young people spoke at the event in Jacksonville, discussing climate change and its impacts on the River City, the Green New Deal, and even the importance of local elections.

“Voting is important,” said Ella Humphries, a 16-year-old student at Stanton College Preparatory School in Jacksonville. “Do you remember the mayor from Jaws? He was still the mayor in Jaws 2. That’s a problem.”

Nathan Geiger, an assistant professor of communication science at Indiana University’s media school, said these types of marches and rallies have two goals: “to influence politicians, policymakers, people of power in this country; and also to influence public opinion.”

Related: Jacksonville Ranks Among Nation’s Worst Cities For Clean Energy

While it remains to be seen whether these strikes lead to policy changes, Geiger said there is evidence that they can sway public opinion.

In a study conducted before and after the People’s Climate March in April of 2017, Geiger and his coauthors found the event did in fact change public opinion.

“The marches positively impacted people's perception of climate advocates. In particular, the marches seemed to reduce people's perception of climate advocates as being arrogant or dictatorial,” he said. “The other thing that we found was that people's perception of the extent to which groups of people could work together on solving problems, such as climate change, had increased.”

Geiger said that second finding is particularly interesting when you factor in the type of media being consumed.

“People consuming conservative media were more pessimistic about people's ability to work together before the marches. But after the marches, we found that conservative media consumers’ pessimism had decreased,” Geiger explained. “They became more hopeful about people's ability to work together.”

In fact, conservative media consumers’ level of hopefulness after the march seemed to mirror that of liberal media consumers.

“The marches had a depolarizing impact on people,” said Geiger.

Because these strikes are youth-led, they may be especially effective at breaking through political divides, according to Geiger.

“Research suggests, at least in some situations, that young people can be among the most effective communicators at persuading people about climate change,” he said. “Because of the fact that they're younger, they have this sort of unique ability to break through and communicate on certain polarized issues where adults may not be able to do so.”

In other words, young people may be able to escape assumptions that they’re acting on behalf of a political agenda or for monetary gain.

“It'll be really interesting to see whether these youth have an impact on changing the conversation, potentially the same way that the March For Our Lives movement may have done with young people getting involved with taking action on gun control,” Geiger said.

The planning of Jacksonville’s climate strike was spearheaded by 15-year-old Katie Carlson, another Stanton College Preparatory School student.

Carlson has never organized or led an event before, but she felt a strong sense of urgency.

“I had been hearing about the strikes, but no one had done anything here. So I said, ‘We're not going to have a strike if I don't organize it.’ And that's what I did,” she said.

More and more people streaming in to Hemming Park for the youth-led #ClimateStrike in #Jacksonville. pic.twitter.com/I459u33dHQ — Brendan Rivers (@BrendanRivers) September 20, 2019

Her priority from the beginning was to make this a youth-led and youth-focused event.

“This is a cliche, but we are the future,” she said. “We are the ones who will be living with the effects of climate change, we will be experiencing the results of these resolutions passed, and we will be the ones to see how everything works out.”

During the strike, attendees were registering to vote and signing a petition urging Mayor Lenny Curry to make a pledge. That pledge would see the mayor commit to taking no more than $200 in contributions from sources associated with fossil fuel and to support the Green New Deal.

The strike was held across the street from City Hall, but Curry didn’t make an appearance. However, Carlson is determined to sit down with the mayor and voice her concerns.

“We have the pledge printed out. We’ll try to organize a meeting with him at some point to get him to sign it. It would be lovely if he could,” she said.

https://www.news4jax.com/news/2019/02/25/petition-asks-city-council-to-reject-jacksonville-landing-demolition/,['Jacksonville'],Petition asks City Council to reject Jacksonville Landing demolition,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. – After the announcement this week of a settlement that includes legislation that would fund the demolition of the Jacksonville Landing, some are taking to Change.org to encourage the City Council to hit the pause button on demo day.

An online petition, which had more than 200 signatures by Sunday evening, asks the City Council to take a longer look at what's next for the iconic riverfront mall and not be in such a hurry to tear it down.

Vote on our USay Poll: Should the city tear down the Landing?

The city of Jacksonville owns the land on the Northbank of the St. Johns River, but it has leased the property to Jacksonville Landing Investments LLC, a subsidiary of Sleiman Enterprises Inc., for the last 15 years.

That lease was supposed to last through 2054, but a public feud between Mayor Lenny Curry and Jacksonville Landing owner Toney Sleiman appeared to end in a truce this week with the announcement of a settlement that would squash any existing disputes between the city and Sleiman, pay off Sleiman and set aside funding for the demolition of the Landing, paving the way for redevelopment.

Several ideas have been tossed around for the future of the downtown landmark, from a new mixed-use complex to a public park.

""It’s past its prime. I think we need to think about something else. What that is is up for debate,"" City Councilman Jim Love said.

City Council President Aaron Bowman told News4Jax that legislation filed as part of the settlement calls for $18 million regarding the Landing. According to Bowman, under the bill, $15 million would be used to settle litigation with JLI and Sleiman, which means lawsuits over the Landing will be dropped and the city of Jacksonville will get the property.

Bowman said $1.5 million would be used for subleased tenants to terminate their leases. He said he believes many tenants have already been notified and the city will help them get out of the leases, which will take several months. He said the remaining $1.5 million would be used for demolition, meaning the city has no intention of keeping the Landing as it currently is.

""This is what the mayor and JLI have come up with -- reasonable terms that they've agreed upon,"" Bowman said. ""If approved by the council, it'll be executed and it'll be over. If the council doesn't like it or disapproves it, then it's going to go back to the drawing board.”

The online petition asks City Council members to deny the demolition of the riverfront mall “until a clear, suitable vision is achieved, and to be transparent in the measures taken to do so.”

City Councilman Matt Schellenberg seemed open to the suggestion.

""I don’t want to demolish anything until we have a plan,"" he told News4Jax on Sunday. ""I wouldn’t necessarily knock down the Landing. I think buying the Landing back is probably a great idea, but I wouldn’t knock it down until you actually have an idea of what you’re going to do with it.""

Bowman said the bill will be introduced Tuesday and then there's a six-week cycle before it would come up for a vote.

The petition takes issue with the recent demolition of downtown properties with what its author called ""no clear vision of future development.”

The city recently imploded the old 15-story City Hall and demolished the old courthouse building downtown, but plans aren't currently in place for what to do with those properties.

https://news.wjct.org/post/study-jacksonville-would-be-nations-most-expensive-city-protect-seawalls,['Jacksonville'],Study: Jacksonville Would Be Nation's Most Expensive City To Protect With Seawalls,"Yet more research shows Florida – and especially Jacksonville – has an expensive road ahead in dealing with rising seas.

A new study by the Center for Climate Integrity shows Jacksonville tops the list of the most expensive cities to protect with seawalls.

According to the study, Jacksonville would need about $3.5 billion to construct 632 miles of seawalls to protect itself from rising seas by 2040. Jacksonville has more square miles to contend with than any other city in the continental U.S. because of its consolidated government with Duval County.

Top 10 List Of Cities Facing The Most Expensive Seawall Costs:

1.) Jacksonville - $3,460,516,000

2.) New York - $1,973,735,000

3.) Virginia Beach - $1,716,510,000

4.) Marathon, Fla. - $1,506,927,000

5.) Fire Island, N.Y. - $1,449,948,000

6.) Galveston, Texas - $1,057,849,000

7.) Charleston, S. C. - $1,031,923,000

8.) Bolivar Peninsula, Texas - $966,919,000

9.) Tampa - $938,350,000

10.) Barnstable Town, Mass. - $889,226,000

The study only looked at seawalls when combating sea level rise. If other costs such as tougher building standards and buyouts were added, the estimates would be significantly higher.

The Center for Climate Integrity asserts that the cost for protecting Jacksonville breaks down to $3,990 per person.

Florida faces the greatest cost in the nation, should it decide to erect the estimated amount of seawalls needed: $75.9 billion for 9,243 miles of seawalls. To put that into perspective, the entire state budget for Florida was $85 billion in 2018, according to the Center for Climate Integrity.

“Florida is by far the most heavily impacted state, with costs reaching nearly $76 billion statewide, 23 counties facing at least $1 billion in seawall expenses alone (and often far greater price tags according to local estimates), and 24 communities where building just this rudimentary level of coastal protection will cost more than $100,000 per person,” the study’s authors wrote.

However, a local coastal engineer calls the report “pretty sensationalistic.”

Erik Olsen is a principal engineer at Olsen Associates, Inc and a member of Jacksonville’s Adaptation Action Area Working Group, which is exploring policies to protect Jacksonville from an assumed 2-feet rise in sea level by 2060.

He said the purpose of the study is to be an eye opener. Olsen also points out that in Jacksonville’s case, seawalls are only a partial solution, and one that would be primarily for areas along the St. Johns River.

In regards to coastal area, Olsen said, “You're not talking about the implementation of seawalls. Pragmatically, you're talking about dunes and increasing the elevations of your beach restoration projects.”

Higher seawalls will likely be part of the solution, though, along the riverbank at Friendship Park on the Southbank, for example.

“I have measured the elevation of the seawalls around downtown just to get an idea as to how they vary. You’d have to raise it, probably, about two feet,” he said.

But seawalls only address a part of the issue. “You can raise the elevation of the seawall, but it doesn’t really, necessarily, affect the drainage,” he said.

He points out that areas like parts of San Marco and Riverside can’t drain fast enough into the St. Johns when big storms hit.

The Center for Climate Integrity claims the costs outlined reflect the bare minimum coastal defenses that communities need to build to “hold back rising seas and prevent chronic flooding and inundation over the next 20 years.”

Olsen’s Jacksonville group hasn’t made any specific recommendations yet. “We’re only at the stage where we are identifying the area that we should be flagging as endangered,” he said.

But Olsen does stress the need for lawmakers to elevate sea level rise on the priority list.

“When will elected officials begin to acknowledge that this is a phenomenon — just like schools, just like redevelopment — that this is a phenomenon that the city of Jacksonville needs to address?” he said.

The study, “Stuck in Traffic,” from the Miami Urban Future Initiative, ranked Miami as having the 12th-worst traffic congestion in country. According to the report, the average commuter loses 100 hours of time in gridlock on roadways each year.

Florida International University professor Richard Florida and New York University professor Steven Pedigo are the co-authors of the report, and Pedigo joined Sundial to break down the report's findings, explain how ride-sharing is affecting traffic and discuss the link between transportation and income inequality.

An interview with Steven Pedigo, co-authors of the report, ""Stuck in Traffic,"" which looks at traffic congestion.

This interview has been edited lightly for clarity.

WLRN: What should we be doing to convince people that carpooling is cool and ride-sharing is the way to go?

PEDIGO: When you look at [New York and San Francisco] they have a much more robust public transportation system and it is a part of their culture to take public transportation. In those cities when we look at the number of people there are more people biking and walking to work in those urban environments. In Miami, we have to think about development and look at the densification of our communities and our downtowns to think about how we could design our areas to facilitate more people to bike and walk to work.

What is the extent ride-sharing has helped change [things] for better or worse? Is it having an impact?

The thought about ride-sharing was the idea that it would encourage people to consider either carpooling with their colleagues or carpooling with their companions, but one of the things that we know about ridesharing is that in fact that Uber and Lyft, particularly in other places like New York, have actually increased the amount of cars on the roadway. One of the things that we have to think about with ride-sharing is how do we balance [more cars]? When we look at the impact ride-sharing is having on public transportation overall it is eating into some of the public transportation.

South Florida's biggest problem is too many cars on the road with just one person in them.

What's happening with ride-sharing is that the cost of ride-sharing is a lot of times not much more inexpensive than maybe taking public transportation from a long distance. The impact that has had is encouraging people to select maybe a ride-sharing as opposed to taking public transportation.

Having less access to public transportation is very much linked to the affordability challenges, income inequality and the access to transportation. - Steven Pedigo

South Florida [also has widespread] economic inequality. How [do the issues] of economic inequality and traffic congestion come together?

We know from our previous study that when we look at income inequality South Florida has the highest income inequality in the country. It is on par with countries like Colombia. The idea of income inequality and the access to transit is: Our region is becoming much more expensive for people to live in it and as it becomes more expensive that means that folks are moving further away. This is extending their commutes. Having less access to public transportation is very much linked to the affordability challenges, income inequality and the access to transportation.

MIAMI--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Faced with the threat of rising seas, stronger hurricanes and intensifying tidal flooding, business and civic leaders in the City of Miami now have a suite of recommendations for adapting to the long-term impacts of climate change, preserving and enhancing quality of life along the Downtown Miami waterfront, and encouraging smart growth in and around Florida’s largest urban district. Through a partnership between the City of Miami and Miami Downtown Development Authority (DDA), the Urban Land Institute (ULI) convened a panel of 10 experts from across the U.S. to study climate-related threats within the City’s urban core, formulate recommendations for hardening the neighborhood’s infrastructure and protecting its natural and manmade assets, and identify potential funding solutions for bringing resiliency projects to life.

As part of the ULI assessment, panelists toured Downtown Miami’s vulnerable areas by land and water and interviewed more than 80 local stakeholders, producing a set of recommendations that were unveiled to the public on June 7, 2019 at Miami City Hall. The panel focused on strengthening the Biscayne Bay waterfront as Downtown Miami’s first line of defense against rising seas, transforming the Miami River into a mixed-use district that bridges the gap between the water and surrounding neighborhoods such as Little Havana and Allapattah, and incentivizing responsible development along an inland ridge of high-lying ground. A more comprehensive report will be released by ULI in the coming months.

“Transforming Miami into a more resilient community means shifting our perception – from viewing the water as a threat, to thinking of the water as a natural asset that we should embrace,” said City of Miami Commission Chairman Ken Russell, who also chairs the Miami DDA. “The Urban Land Institute’s preliminary findings provide us with a roadmap for enacting design, infrastructure, zoning and financing strategies that will ensure Miami sustains its growth as a world-class city – not for years, not for generations, but forever.”

Following is a summary of the panel’s recommendations:

Update zoning and building guidelines to incorporate resilience principles, including adapting the code to meet minimum thresholds for insurance coverage and real estate market demand

that incorporates resilience as a key element to guide development in Downtown and along the waterfront Strengthen community preparedness in vulnerable locations through neighborhood outreach, emergency management, and local partnerships

The panel’s recommendations coincide with a surge of development, investment and in-migration within Miami’s urban core and along the Miami Riverfront. Home to a daytime population of more than 250,000 people and more than 92,000 full-time residents – representing a 40 percent increase since 2010 – Greater Downtown Miami is among the country’s fastest-growing residential and commercial neighborhoods. The three-square-mile district encompasses real estate assets valued at nearly $40 billion, including more than 53,000 residential units, 25 million square feet of office space, 8,000 hotel rooms, several interconnected transit systems, and a host of public museums, parks and cultural venues.

“Miami enlisted this panel of experts with the goal of gathering independent perspective on how we plan, design and pay for the changes we need to make along our waterfronts to adapt and thrive in this changing climate,” explains Jane Gilbert, Chief Resilience Officer for the City of Miami. “The ULI panel recommendations both validate the critical importance of the steps the City has already taken, including the updates to our Stormwater Master Plan, Miami21 and initial infrastructure investments through the Miami Forever Bond and motivates the City to continue to strengthen interagency partnerships and resident and business engagement needed to move forward with innovative design and financing solutions.”

Scientific research indicates that Miami, like many coastal cities, faces the prospect of rising seas and warmer temperatures over the coming decades. Water levels are expected to rise between two and two-and-a-half feet by 2060, according to the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact. At the same time, the number of 90-degree days in Miami is expected to rise from 130 to 180 days per year by 2080.

“Downtown Miami is experiencing an incredible period of economic and urban growth, and the presence of an accessible and continuous waterfront is among the district’s most valuable assets,” observed panel chair Ladd Keith, Chair of the Sustainable Built Environments program at the University of Arizona. “Miami is already making strides toward becoming a stronger community in the face of a changing climate through collaborations like the Resilient305 strategy, and now the City must learn how to protect from, live with and create value from the water. That process begins with ushering in built and living infrastructure and quality of life upgrades along the waterfront, exploring forward-looking regulatory, zoning and policy changes, identifying creative financing solutions, and prioritizing community education and preparedness.”

Keith was joined by panel vice chair Michelle Beaman Chang, founder and chief executive officer, Imby Community, Inc., Washington, D.C.; Jason Bonnet, vice president of development, Brookfield Properties, San Francisco, California; Samia Byrd, deputy county manager, Arlington County Government, Arlington, Virginia; John Macomber, senior lecturer in the finance unit, Harvard Business School, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts; Michael Rodriguez, leader, market research and insights, mid‐Atlantic region, CBRE, Inc., Washington, D.C.; Susannah Ross, landscape architect, Boston, Massachusetts; Matt Steenhoek, vice president of development, PN Hoffman, Washington, D.C.; Byron Stigge, founder, Level Infrastructure, New York, New York and Jay Valgora, founder and principal, Studio V Architecture, New York, New York.

https://www.smartcitiesworld.net/news/news/miami-launches-a-model-for-urban-resilience-4232,['Miami'],Miami launches a model for urban resilience,"Miami-Dade County, City of Miami and City of Miami Beach has launched its Resilient305 Strategy, which aims to ensure communities are better prepared for shocks and stresses brought about by events such as hurricanes and infrastructure failures. It is also targeting longer-term challenges like rising sea levels, traffic congestion and severe economic inequalities.

The plan supports multilateral collaboration between governmental, non-governmental, business and academic organisations in the region to ensure a resilient and thriving future for all, environmentally, economically and socially.

Places, people, pathways

The Resilient305 Strategy focuses on three main goal areas: places, people and pathways. It has been driven by Greater Miami & the Beaches (GM&B), a unique partnership of Miami-Dade County, the City of Miami, and the City of Miami Beach. To ensure the strategy has a broad impact, GM&B will continue to expand to include the other 32 municipalities, other community organisations and anchor institutions.

It has been developed over a three-year period, with the support of the 100 Resilient Cities (100RC) Network, The Miami Foundation and input from thousands of stakeholders through a series of public meetings, surveys and focus groups.

""Successfully combatting our resilience challenges, from sea level rise to job creation, depends on this unified approach”

More than 50 actions have been identified, developed and organised for the strategy in the three overarching areas:



Places: addresses location-based challenges by enhancing climate resilience through design and planning; creating, connecting and improving mobility and housing options; and safeguarding ecosystems. Actions in this goal area focus on building healthy coral reefs and ecosystems, reducing storm surge vulnerability, developing mobility hubs and connectivity, and redeveloping public housing to make it more resilient, among others.

People: aims to improve the lives of citizens every day by supporting job and wealth creation; addressing specific health needs for the most vulnerable; and preparing and empowering neighbourhoods and networks to anticipate and respond to disruptions, both large and small. The strategy will look at ensuring representation in the census, breaking the cycle of youth violence, increasing resilience through volunteer emergency training and engaging communities through public art to help enhance the region’s social sustainability.



Pathways: seeks to bring together governments, businesses, community organisations, and educational institutions by setting common goals and committing to actions, such as utilising a pre-planning for post-disaster toolkit, creating an actionable science advisory panel (ASAP), and utilizing the City Water Resilience Approach to improve coordination and resilience on water issues.

Strategy implementation

Implementation of the Strategy will be overseen by the PIVOT Team (Progress, Innovation, and Vision for Our Tomorrow) led by Miami-Dade County, City of Miami, City of Miami Beach and The Miami Foundation, with the participation of municipalities countywide and a host of partners, including the Army Corps of Engineers, the Miami-Dade County Public School System, universities, non-profit organisations and other public partners.



“The launch of the Resilient305 Strategy marks a defining moment in Miami-Dade County’s history. Much more than a blueprint for the future, it is a living, breathing, fully functional roadmap for the present,"" said Miami-Dade County mayor Carlos A. Giménez. ""Best of all, it is backed by the full weight of the County’s multi-year capital planning budget, which has earmarked more than $22 billion for wide-ranging resilience efforts.”

In a data-driven report, Florida and Pedigo examine the current state of transportation, congestion, and commuting in Miami, along with new opportunities to create a more sustainable and better-functioning transportation network.

""The kind of traffic congestion Miami now has is an unyielding barrier to the region's innovative aspirations and economic competitiveness,"" explains Florida. ""Time wasted in congestion is a deadweight economic loss. When a place gets too congested and clogged up, its innovative potential and economic capacity suffer.""

Key Findings

Among large metros, Greater Miami has the 12 th -worst traffic congestion in the country. The average commuter loses more than 100 hours of productive time to congestion each year, and this costs the metro roughly $4 billion in lost economic output.

The average commuter loses more than 100 hours of productive time to congestion each year, and this costs the metro roughly in lost economic output. Greater Miami has the 13 th -longest median commute time in the country. The average commuter drives roughly 30 minutes each way.

More than three-quarters of commuters drive alone to work. That's far more than in leading global cities like and leading startup hubs like , where a much greater fraction of commuters use transit or bicycle or walk to work. Just 3 percent of Miami commuters use public transit, and ridership is declining. Compare that to nearly a fifth of San Franciscans and nearly a third of New Yorkers.

Compare that to nearly a fifth of San Franciscans and nearly a third of New Yorkers. An even smaller fraction of Miami commuters walks or bicycles to work. Just 1.5 percent of Miami commuters walk to work, and fewer than 1 percent bike to work—a shocking statistic for such a warm, sunny climate. Poor infrastructure and dangerous conditions are a powerful disincentive for walking and bicycling commuters. Worse, this phenomenon hurts the region's ability to compete for tech talent and sends a signal that Miami is not a major knowledge hub.

The recent report by urban researchers Richard Florida and Steven Pedigo says the Miami region's housing unaffordability crisis reinforces its high levels of inequality.

""Miami has a very high end economy, attracting people from around the world. And an incredible influx of north easterners are streaming in here with high incomes,"" Florida said. ""On the other hand, we have another economy, which is entirely filled with people who may not be working or working in very low skilled insecure jobs. And they’re sinking.""

The report says only Hong Kong, Sydney, Los Angeles, London, Toronto and New York are more expensive than the Miami area.

According to the study, ""low-income service workers"" make up more than half of the region’s workforce. So while Miami has seen a surplus of units being built - and the values of those units are rapidly appreciating - the city’s workforce has not grown with it. Wages and incomes are not keeping pace.

""We have one of the most service dependent, low skilled, economies in the United States,"" Florida said.

It also says that 6 in 10 employed adults in Miami are spending more than 30 percent of their income on housing. That is the highest rate of any large metro area in the United States.

A resident is considered ""housing cost-burdened"" at that threshold or higher.

The report says housing affordability needs to be front and center in any discussion of economic development in Miami.

""I don't even have to mince words, we have built housing for rich people,"" Florida said. ""That's our crisis. Too much housing for rich people and not enough affordable housing for not so rich people.""",[]

Clint Simpson Clint Simpson Image 1 of / 3 Caption Close On the Move: Houston’s urban environment attracts newcomers 1 / 3 Back to Gallery

As a city, Houston has long been famous for its urban sprawl. But, over the past several years, the Bayou City has become much more densely populated, as more and more people continue to move here.

This has brought a renewed focus on urban living, and the many conveniences that such a lifestyle can afford. This includes a long list of amenities, and the increased desire among residents for walkability. This represents a bit of a shift for Houston, which has always been a city dominated more by cars than pedestrians.

Today, Houston boasts of a very vibrant urban environment, which is attracting both local residents and newcomers alike.

Urban lifestyle draw

According to Kelly Pachar, a Realtor with Heritage Texas Properties, many of his relocation clients are drawn to the urban lifestyle because of the trend toward urbanization that is taking place across the country.

“A lot of people who are moving here have had urban experiences in other cities, so they want it again in Houston. There are also other people who have lived in the suburbs in another city, but they always wanted to do the urban thing, so their move now gives them that opportunity,” said Pachar.

He added that people really enjoy the convenience of being able to take advantage of the many cultural events and entertainment options that Houston has to offer, without having to drive a long distance to get there.

But, Pachar said that convenience does come at a cost.

Living in one of Houston’s more popular urban locations can be relatively more expensive than housing options in other areas, and there might be certain aspects that home buyers would need to give up in favor of the lifestyle.

Some ‘sacrifices’

For example, it might be necessary for home buyers to give up square footage, a large backyard, or a three-car garage in order to be in the area where they want to live.

“When I first started in real estate 12 years ago, Midtown was the hopping area, and if people couldn’t afford Midtown, then we would go to EaDo. Now, EaDo is as expensive or more expensive than Midtown, so I am always looking at what some of the other up-and-coming areas are for my clients.

“I think part of being a good Realtor is knowing those transitional adjacent neighborhoods, which can give people an alternative,” Pachar said.

For people who are moving here and are not sure whether urban living is really for them, Pachar said that renting can be a great way to try it before making a purchase.

“Leasing gives people the ability to test drive both the lifestyle and the community. If someone is moving here from another city, even if they have been here many times, they won’t be able to really get to know the city until they are here every day,” Pachar said.

Clint Simpson, a Realtor associate with Greenwood King Properties, is also seeing a big push among his out-of-town home buyers toward an urban lifestyle.

“My clients like the walkability to all of the retail shops and restaurants, and everything else that is close by,” said Simpson.

For the most part, he said that when his clients are evaluating areas, one of the top considerations is the accessibility to work. This makes areas such as the Memorial Park area, the Washington Avenue area, and Montrose highly sought after.

“A lot of these clients have offices located downtown, so being in these areas brings them much closer to the downtown area and their offices, which is a big plus,” Simpson said. “They also like the ability to be close to nature in Memorial Park and Discovery Green.”

In terms of the affordability of different areas and neighborhoods, he said that housing costs depend on the location.

“Property values are typically higher the closer you get to downtown, with the exception of EaDo, because EaDo is such a transition area and is considered up and coming. There are still lots of properties there that are being refurbished, rebuilt or completely torn down and replaced by new construction,” said Simpson.

He also said that urban living has an appeal for a wide variety of clients, in various stages of their lives. So, it’s not necessarily a trend characterized by a younger generation of people. He said that it’s all about the lifestyle choice.

“I find that people with children want to be outside of the downtown area, but people who don’t have children yet, or have children who are older or grown want to be closer in and more urban,” Simpson said.

https://www.houstonchronicle.com/business/article/Lowe-Heights-District-Regency-Square-developers-13852104.php,['Houston'],"Lower Heights District, Regent Square developers disclose plans for their urban sites","Developers revealed new details Thursday for two mixed-use real estate projects long planned for oversized sites in the urban core.

The developments, each on sites of more than 20 acres, have been years in the making as the owners waited out economic downturns, sought tenants and revised their designs.

Construction recently started at Lower Heights District, a 24-acre site a mile west of downtown, just south of Interstate 10 between Sawyer and Studemont, a burgeoning neighborhood of upscale restaurants, art studios and shops.

While the first phase of the project — a 370-unit apartment complex and 78,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space — is under construction, plans are in the works for a cinema and dining concept, office buildings and more apartments and shops, according to Gulf Coast Commercial Group, the Houston developer that bought the site in 2015 for $40 million.

Also on Thursday, the Boston-based firm behind Regent Square, a mixed-use development planned on the former site of the Allen House Apartments, said it would start construction this fall on a 600-unit apartment complex and 50,000 square feet of retail space on a portion of the site at West Dallas and Dunlavy streets.

Several years ago, Alamo Drafthouse Cinema, an entertainment concept that combines a movie theater and dining, said it was planning a location in Regent Square, but a spokesperson for GID Development Group said those plans were off.

Boston architecture firm CBT is designing the new buildings. Apartment floor plans will range from studios with separate sleeping alcoves to large two-bedroom units. The shops will ring a central plaza designed by Houston-based OJB Landscape Architecture.

JLL has been tapped to oversee retail leasing for the entire mixed-use district along West Dallas Street between College Memorial Park Cemetery and Waugh Drive, across Allen Parkway from Buffalo Bayou Park.

GID announced plans to develop Regent Square in 2007. At that time, the property housed the Allen House Apartments, which GID had owned for decades. Most of the apartments were demolished, but the project stalled until GID built a 21-story apartment tower at 3233 W. Dallas. That building, called the Sovereign, was completed in 2015.

“Our goal for Regent Square is the creation of an exemplary, urban mixed-use district in the heart of Houston. Phase 2, the core of the masterplan, is poised to establish the project as a dynamic, walkable place as it weaves high quality restaurants, retail and residential into the fabric of the surrounding neighborhoods,” James Linsley, GID’s president, said in a statement.

Lower Heights District, designed by Gensler, is also designed to be open and walkable, with small plazas and green spaces. Diners will spill onto outdoor restaurant patios and the project, near the hike and bike trail, will cater to trail users as well as nearby residents, the developer said.

Gulf Coast said there are plans to develop a 120,000-square-foot office building constructed with cross-laminated timber wood panels made from several layers of lumber glued and stacked that is said to be an environmentally friendly construction material.

Trammell Crow Residential is developing the apartment complex under construction at Lower Heights District. Completion is expected mid-2020. Total Wine and Ulta Beauty have finalized leases for the retail space underway, but the developer would not reveal names of the other tenants it is talking to.

https://www.houstonchronicle.com/opinion/outlook/article/Good-Reason-aims-to-make-all-of-Houston-s-14070606.php,['Houston'],Good Reason aims to make all of Houston’s public schools good ones [Opinion],"There are 900,000 children who call Harris County home — children with dreams of becoming teachers, scientists, entrepreneurs, and leaders — but the reality is, we are not providing all our children with the education they need to achieve their dreams.

Half a million of our children attend school in Houston’s urban core — districts centrally located in Harris County where more than 70 percent of the students are economically disadvantaged. More than half of them are not receiving the type of education that will propel them to futures filled with opportunity.

In August our schools will receive letter grades from the Texas Education Agency. Assuming no significant changes, more than 300,000 students across Houston’s urban core will be learning in schools rated C, D or F. We are facing an educational crisis, one that disproportionately affects our black, Latino, and low-income students.

Houston, this cannot be the legacy we leave.

This is why, together, Houston Endowment and Kinder Foundation helped launch Good Reason Houston to champion a bold, optimistic vision for our region — that every child, in every neighborhood, excels in a world-class public school and thrives in the Houston of tomorrow.

Today we are asking Houston parents, educators, leaders and community members to come together and join us to fulfill this vision.

Since its launch in 2017, Good Reason Houston has been on a mission to increase the number of students achieving in great public schools, both traditional and charter. The organization brings best practices, financial resources, and staff time and expertise to local school systems to support strategies that will improve existing schools and create new high-performing ones.

Good Reason Houston has set an ambitious goal: to increase the number of students learning in A and B schools by 60,000 by the end of the 2025-26 school year. While this is just a start, 60,000 represents a 30 percent increase over the number of students learning in A and B schools today. Phase I of this plan will see an increase of 10,000 more students in high-performing schools by the end of the 2020-21 school year.

As with any worthy effort, this plan costs money; an investment of $61 million from public and private sources is required, with $34 million from philanthropic investments. Our foundations have taken the first step by providing catalyst funding of $20 million for Phase I - this in addition to the funding we provided to launch Good Reason Houston.

We did so because we believe this is not only a critical investment in 300,000 children, but also a necessary investment in our city’s future.

As all investors do, we did our homework. We researched how other cities address educational inequities, and we saw that to accomplish region-wide transformation, the vision and plan must be bigger than any one school and any one district.

Other cities, including Washington, D.C., Dallas, and Indianapolis have organizations that keep the larger community laser-focused on a clear goal to accelerate student outcomes. We knew that’s what was missing in Houston.

For the first phase, Good Reason Houston has partnered with Houston-area districts that primarily serve economically disadvantaged students — students who often attend our most persistently failing schools.

Some of this work is already happening and being celebrated. For example, in the 2019-20 school year, Good Reason Houston will continue to support Aldine ISD’s implementation of the Accelerating Campus Excellence (ACE) program at Goodman and Worsham Elementary Schools. The ACE model, which has been proven to dramatically improve student outcomes, brings a district’s most effective educators to some of its most struggling schools.

In Dallas and Fort Worth ISDs, the ACE model resulted in 17 out of 18 Improvement Required campuses leaving that state list within one year, and 66 percent of the ACE schools are currently rated A or B by the Texas Education Agency. We look forward to watching Aldine have similar success.

Good Reason Houston will continue to expand its footprint in the months and years ahead, partnering with more area school districts to implement innovative solutions. These solutions include strategic professional development for educators, replicating some of our region’s high-performing schools, and creating new school models within districts.

Our legislators showed a tremendous commitment to students across Texas with the passing of HB 3, and it is now our time to build on that commitment. This plan requires the entire Houston community to set aside differences of opinion and ideology and come together around a bold vision to achieve better outcomes for all our region’s students.

We challenge everyone in the Houston community to join us in ensuring that all our students have the opportunity to attend a great school — the kind of school that gives each child, regardless of background or Zip code, the opportunity to seize their dreams.

Good Reason Houston has earned our confidence for the initial work they have done already in bringing together our city’s best talent and resources to prove what’s possible. We are energized to be a part of this. If the rest of the community joins us, we all have good reason to be optimistic about what lies ahead.

https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Houston-lifts-minimum-parking-requirements-in-14103862.php,['Houston'],"Houston lifts minimum parking requirements in EaDo, Midtown","Property owners in east downtown and part of Midtown will be exempt from Houston’s minimum parking requirements under an ordinance approved by City Council on Wednesday that allows developers to decide how many parking spaces businesses and residences require.

The move, proposed by Mayor Sylvester Turner’s administration and largely backed by urbanists and business leaders, passed with District G Councilman Greg Travis casting the lone dissenting vote. The measure expands the use of so-called market-based parking, which already exists in the central business district.

Opponents of parking minimums say the requirements produce an excessive number of parking lots that eat up space in the urban core, making it harder to traverse cities on foot or by public transit. Cities around the country have moved in recent years to eliminate or soften minimum parking regulations.

Houston’s move to lift the parking minimums comes as public debate plays out over a proposed state project to remake Interstate 45 and ahead of a likely November vote in which the Metropolitan Transit Authority is expected to ask voters for authority to borrow $3.5 billion to support a wave of transit projects.

As council members weighed Turner’s proposal Wednesday, the discussion turned to the future of transportation and accessibility in Houston, where residents and development long have depended heavily on cars.

“It seems to me that in a city of 600-plus miles, that we not only are now, but we are going to continue to be a city that’s going to require access by vehicles of some sort — cars, Uber, whatever,” District J Councilman Mike Laster said. “I don’t know how we develop a comprehensive transportation plan in the city and the county and the region if you don’t implement a complementary parking plan to go with that.”

Urban planning experts generally say cities should seek to become less car-dependent as they become more dense, because cars take up a large amount of space, an argument made by Houston transportation planner Geoff Carleton in a recent Chronicle op-ed. Planners also say buildings located near public transit, such as Metro’s light rail lines in Midtown and EaDo, should provide less parking than those located elsewhere.

District I Councilman Robert Gallegos, who represents the East End, cited a study Wednesday concluding cities tend to require too much parking near transit stations, stymieing development on valuable land.

“More parking lots in our neighborhoods do not protect our neighborhoods,” Gallegos said. “We need to realize that nowadays with taxis, with Uber, with Lyft, with rail, with bikes, all these parking lots around transit centers are not needed.”

Travis, the sole vote against the measure, grappled with his support for the free market and cutting regulations with his concern that stripping parking minimums would produce “unintended consequences.”

“If you do not have enough adequate parking, you don’t have an adequate number of customers,” Travis said. “You can walk, skip, crawl, I don’t care what you do to get to these establishments. We are not high-density like New York.”

At-Large Councilwoman Amanda Edwards backed the measure and suggested the city should try to partner with private firms to build parking garages that she said could bring revenue to the city.

Before the measure came before city council, it passed through several rounds of public vetting and feedback. The city’s planning and development department introduced the concept last August to neighborhood groups and other stakeholders. Days later, the department brought the proposal before the city planning commission, which approved the measure, sending it to a city council committee.

Along the way, neighborhood group members weighed in at a series of public hearings. The chief opposition came from neighborhood leaders who said cars would overflow onto the streets of adjacent neighborhoods if businesses were not bound by parking minimums. Laster echoed that concern Wednesday.

Those who supported the measure noted it does not restrict property owners from providing parking.

“This does not mean that (developers) will not provide parking. It means they will provide as many parking spaces as the market dictates,” Hector Rodriguez, an administration manager with the planning department, told council members at a council committee meeting in March.

In recent weeks, the proposal appeared to meet more resistance from those who argued it does not go far enough.

The planning department’s first iteration would have exempted all of Midtown from the parking requirements. Turner agreed to remove east Midtown — south of McGowen and east of San Jacinto streets — from the exempted area, after Midtown super neighborhood leaders raised opposition to the measure.

Turner later shot down pleas from the Midtown Management District to fold east Midtown back in, though the mayor said he intends to remove parking minimums in east Midtown if the measure proves successful.

The planning department initially considered expanding market-based parking into the Fifth Ward, too. Rodriguez said department staff supported the idea, but wanted more time to hear public feedback.

Mayor Pro Tem Ellen Cohen, whose District C includes some of the exempted area, said she supported the measure despite some opposition from neighborhood group members.

“No one is going to be completely happy,” she said. “It’s a shared sacrifice, so there’s going to be a little discomfort on all sides. But it works. We have evidence that it works.”",[]

Now, Buffalo Bayou Park joins the fertile mix, with a recent selection as a finalist of the 2019 Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence. This means the park can secure either a gold medal, with a $50,000 prize, or a silver medal, with a $10,000 prize, to enhance current and future projects.

Buffalo Bayou Park was recognized for its “enhancement of a historic waterway into a resilient public greenspace,” according to a statement by Buffalo Bayou Partnership and SWA Group. The nomination is especially sweet, given the myriad floodings and setbacks the park has endured post-Harvey.

Buffalo Bayou Park joins four other 2019 finalists from across the country, including Sulphur Springs, Texas, which was recognized for its renewal of a rural, small-town civic plaza and main street. The other projects hail from Lynn, Massachusetts; Memphis, Tennessee; and New Orleans.

The biennial award has recognized transformative places that contribute to the economic, environmental, and social vitality of American cities, according to a statement. Seventy-eight projects in 27 states have been honored since its founding.

Finalists and medalists are chosen by a nationwide committee of urban experts through an in-depth evaluation process involving input from the award application, site visits, interviews with project participants and community members, and committee discussions.

Next month, RBA staffers will begin site visits to each finalist project in preparation for the committee’s selection of the medal winners in June. Buffalo Bayou Park and the other finalists will be featured in Metropolis magazine.

“Buffalo Bayou Partnership extends our congratulations to the park designers and consultants as well as our sincerest thanks to the Kinder Foundation for its catalyst gift and to all of the generous funders that made Buffalo Bayou Park possible,” park reps say in a statement. “Special thanks also to the Downtown Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone #3 that provides BBP with annual funding for the park's operations and maintenance.”",[]
https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Houston-s-affordable-housing-could-get-45M-13875147.php,['Houston'],Houston’s housing programs could get $45M boost from HUD grant program,"The City Council on Wednesday authorized Houston’s housing department to apply for about $45 million in federal funding in part to help the city build its stock of affordable housing.

The city’s housing department would use the money, granted through four programs under the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, primarily to increase homeownership, improve city amenities and expand affordable housing.

The bulk of the funding — about $28 million — would flow through HUD’s Community Development Block Grant program, which allocates funds to Houston each year on top of the disaster recovery grant money it has sent to the city for Hurricane Harvey recovery.

On HoustonChronicle.com: Harvey’s aftermath: Houstonians struggle to recover after hurricane

About a quarter of the community development grant money would be slated for improving public facilities, with another quarter going toward home rehabilitation, according to the housing department’s recommendations.

The rest would be split among public services, at about $3.5 million; code enforcement, about $2.8 million; multifamily housing, $300,000; economic development, $400,000; and lead-paint abatement, $275,000.

The program administration price tag comes in at just over $5.6 million. The housing department estimates that it would generate about $4 million through the block grant program, with $24 million coming in potential federal funds.

The item passed with little fuss among council members, though At-Large Councilwoman Amanda Edwards, who previously objected to requirements in contracts for Hurricane Harvey recovery, asked whether there was a way to divert people awaiting Harvey aid into other programs.

On HoustonChronicle.com: Thousands line up for Hurricane Harvey recovery funds but they're still waiting

Constituents were so confused by the process, she said, that they dropped out of the system entirely.

“There’s frustration with our housing programs in terms of the various requirements,” Edwards said. “I don’t know if it would be applicable, but I think we need a systematic approach to how we can register better customer service to our residents, so it’s not a frustrating process.”

Edwards’ comments did not generate discussion among council members and the grant application passed without any objection.

The funding amounts approved Wednesday fall in line with the housing department’s annual grant applications in prior years.

Council members also gave the housing department authority to apply for $9.4 million in grants that would fund a variety of services for single- and multi-family affordable rental units, including rehabilitation, relocation and construction of new units.

The grant application also contains about $9.9 million for housing for people with AIDS, setting aside funds for rental assistance and other housing services. About $2 million would additionally go toward homeless shelters and programs that aim to prevent homelessness.

A project to build one of Texas' largest urban solar farms in south Houston is underway. The City of Houston has selected Wolfe Energy to develop the farm in Sunnyside on a 240-acre landfill that has been closed for decades.

The project is part of the city's participation in the C40 Reinventing Cities competition, which Houston joined in 2017.

The farm's 70 megawatt solar array could generate electricity for 12,000 homes and provide discounted rates for Sunnyside residents, according to the city.

“We’re taking a former landfill and making it into a productive, useful neighbor,” Dori Wolfe, owner of Wolfe Energy, told News 88.7.

The company says the solar farm is also part of the city’s strategy to combat climate change.

“Within the first five years of its operation, it will offset the carbon it took to create the farm,” said Wolfe, “and then it will be net carbon inducive because it’s offsetting fossil fuel carbon output.”



Solar farms are a new trend

While Houston is touting this development as one of the largest of its kind in the state, the concept of urban solar farms is already taking off. Energy expert Joshua Rhodes said urban solar farms are becoming a trend in Texas.

“Since the price of solar (energy) has been dropping significantly, it’s making more and more sense on these smaller scales,” said Rhodes, a researcher at the University of Texas at Austin's Energy Institute. “We’re starting to see more development, you’re starting to see communities decide that they want this.”

Rhodes said it’s sometimes hard to build new energy infrastructure in cities, so solar farms are seen as beneficial for the local power grid. Those grids don’t store energy, so when a solar farm produces power “that means some other power plant, one that likely produces carbon dioxide, is not going to be producing as much power.”

Sunnyside revitalization

City leaders also see the farm as a step toward revitalizing the Sunnyside neighborhood. Larissa Williams is the energy manager in the city's Office of Sustainability. She said the landfill where the farm will be built had become an “eyesore” and pointed at more affordable electricity as a positive outcome for residents.

The city and Wolfe Energy are currently working out the details of the lease for the land and a environmental feasibility study will be conducted.

Wolfe said she expects the farm to start operating in late 2020 or early 2021.

the overhaul of the 550,000 square foot barbara jordan post office, which was in use by the US government from 1936-2014, was announced by lovett commercial who plan to turn the site into a ‘one-of-a-kind urban ecosystem’. titled POST houston, the development aims to reinvigorate the city’s north downtown neighborhoods with a mixed-use environment combining arts, entertainment, creative workspaces, dining, and retail.

‘in a city that is constantly reinventing itself, it is incredible to have an opportunity to transform a building of such solidity and sheer scale,’ says OMA partner jason long, who led the design of the project. ‘lovett’s vision to preserve this structure from houston’s past allowed us to design a multi-layered, interconnected platform for the city’s cultural and commercial future.’

the existing warehouse will be punctured vertically with skylights and atriums, while new passages will establish distinct thoroughfares of connected activities. the three atriums, each covered with an ETFE roof system and excavated from the existing structural grid, bring light into the depth of the building. meanwhile, connecting the complex vertically, monumental staircases culminate in ‘skylawn’ — a rooftop park and farm designed by hoerr schaudt.

as one of the world’s largest rooftop parks and farms, the rooftop features 360 degree, unobstructed views of the city’s downtown skyline and includes multiple dining and event venues, recreation and open spaces, as well as a stage for events. the property’s culinary tenants will be able to source ingredients from the rooftop farm, allowing them to offer a rooftop-to-table experience. phase one of the mixed-use adaptive reuse project began in early september 2018 and is expected to complete in summer 2020.

https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/map-predicts-how-climate-change-will-feel-city-where-you-live-180971487/,['Washington'],"With Climate Change, Washington, D.C. Will Feel More Like Arkansas by 2080","The threat of climate change is big, yet nebulous enough that it can be easy to ignore despite mounting evidence that humanity faces a future with more extreme heat waves, floods, drought and food shortages. Those hazards may just affect someone else. But a new study aims to make the effects personal by showing how the climate may change in your city.

Philadelphia in 2080 will feel a bit more like the climate of current day Memphis, for instance. Researchers analyzed rainfall and temperature trends and compared them to climate models for 540 cities across the U.S. and Canada. Their results forecast a climate change ""twin city"" for the future of each urban area, writes Robinson Meyer for The Atlantic.

""Everything gets warmer,"" researcher Matt Fitzpatrick tells The Atlantic. Fitzpatrick is an associate professor at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science. ""I don't think I've seen a place that doesn't.""

Wondering what the future may hold for a particular city? The researchers created a web tool that allows people to play around with locations and climate change scenarios and see for themselves. The cities analyzed are home to 75 percent of the population of the U.S. and 50 percent of the population of Canada.

Summers in Washington, D.C., for example, are already pretty hot and sticky—but just wait until the 2080s. Even with reduced carbon emissions, the nation's capitol is predicted to feel more like Paragould, Arkansas, where July temps regularly hover just above a sultry 90 degrees Fahrenheit, warmed by tropical air from the Gulf of Mexico. By comparison, Washington, D.C.'s July average high is just below 80 degrees. Say goodbye to the occasional snowpacolypse; Paragould currently gets an average of two inches of snowfall a year, according to U.S. Climate Data.

And keep in mind this is basically a best case scenario. If the world continues to put out unchecked emissions, D.C. residents could expect to experience weather currently seen by the people in Greenwood, Mississippi, where it's way hotter and more humid than Paragould.

Overall, cities in the northeast will tend to feel more like the subtropical climes found in the modern southeastern U.S., the researchers report in the journal Nature. Western cities should expect to feel more like the desert Southwest.

If the world doesn't cut back on emissions and climate change predictions hold true, the cities in the study will have conditions most similar to locations that are, on average, nearly 530 miles away from their modern day location.

One difficult finding is that many cities will experience change to a climate that doesn't look like anything currently in North America. ""It really underscores this dramatic transformation of climate that occur over the next 60 years, in the lifetime of children alive today,"" Fitzpatrick tells Rachel Becker at The Verge.

The analogy isn't perfect, particularly where rainfall is concerned. The researchers had to pick the analogous city with the best fit to the predictions. Also, the results only offer a picture of the average climate. Cold snaps, heatwaves and more complicated phenomena—such as the effect of urban heat islands, where cities absorb more heat than surrounding areas—aren't part of this model, reports Matt Simon at Wired.

The point of the paper is to try and get people to think about how climate change may affect them. Fitzpatrick and his co-author Robert R. Dunn, an applied ecologist at North Carolina State University, write:

""Translating and communicating these abstract predictions in terms of present-day, local, and concrete personal experiences may help overcome some barriers to public recognition of the risks (and opportunities) of climate change.""

The study could even spur action, suggests Kevin Burke, a climate scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who was not involved in the new study. “One notable outcome of this work is the potential for cities and their analog pairs to transfer knowledge and coordinate climate adaptation strategies,"" Burke tells Wired.

The changes mapped in the tool only account for the actual conditions people might experience when they step outside. The other effects of climate change remain to be seen. Maybe future tools could help people see how floods and heatwaves could come to their hometown. Or what new invasive species, weeds, pests or diseases may become their neighbors. What tools like this cannot do is predict the unexpected challenges a warming climate may force upon us.",[]
https://civileats.com/2019/09/26/the-woman-leading-the-way-for-urban-farming-in-the-nations-capital/,['Washington'],The Woman Leading the Way for Urban Farming in the Nation’s Capital,"With her background in advocacy, welcoming smile, air of refinement, and down-for-doing-business demeanor, it would be easy to assume that when Gail Taylor visits Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., every Wednesday, she’s going to meet congressional staffers for high-stakes legislative deal making.

But instead of heading into the halls of Congress in a power suit, Taylor drives into the parking lot of a condo complex near the U.S. Capitol, where she pitches a tent, sets up tables, and unpacks heaps of vegetables. On a recent day, they included orange and purple carrots, dark green cucumbers, heads of green cabbage, green beans, and a milk crate of hardneck garlic. This mid-summer week, she also has baskets of blueberries, red gooseberries, yellow plums, heirloom tomatoes, Presidio rice, and bags of hand-milled flour.

Then she awaits the arrival of 25 of her community supported agriculture (CSA) subscribers, who’ve signed up to retrieve their weekly share from Three Part Harmony, a farm she established three-and-a-half miles from the White House.

“I started with six CSA members on my porch, and now we do almost 200 shares, three days, and seven locations,” Taylor says.

Taylor’s efforts have not only led to the first production-focused organic farm and CSA accessible by bus or bike to D.C. residents. They have also led to the passage of legislation encouraging D.C. landowners to give their property over to agricultural purposes, helping make the nation’s capital a more friendly place for urban farms.

District Councilmember David Grosso helped Taylor in her policy work. “She set up a model that wasn’t just about community gardens, but more about the expansion of urban farming, to grow quality food closer to the source of consumption,” he said. “It wasn’t about sharing a plot; it was bigger than that.”

Marla Karina Larrave, an advocate for justice in food and farming policy and Three Part Harmony CSA member, says, “She’s definitely the people’s farmer. In terms of farming, you’re talking to the most awesome person in D.C.”

Returning to the Land

Taylor’s venture into farming took root during a self-described “quarter-life crisis.” With a degree in U.S. foreign policy and Latin America, she worked as a human rights advocate before quitting to spend nine months in Guatemala on a project to promote healing among women recovering from the trauma of civil war.

Then, instead of continuing a career path in diplomacy when she returned, Taylor signed up to volunteer at a food co-op. A vegetarian since her teens, she wanted to learn more about food and have enough to eat while she was unemployed. She also began volunteering at an organic farm in rural Maryland.

“I was doing a lot of weeding and transplanting and more weeding,” Taylor said. “I loved it. I was like ‘Oh my gosh, I never have to turn on a computer again.’”

A dozen years later, her passion for farming has become her profession. “My favorite times this year were when I went to the farm on a Saturday afternoon, locked myself in the fence by myself, and worked until the sun went down,” she says.

With farmers on both sides of her family tree, Taylor’s connection to the land runs deep. But Taylor doesn’t see her pivot into agriculture as unique to her personal family history. Rather, it’s something she shares with many African Americans, who despite family histories of farm life that include exploitation, are rediscovering the land, redefining their role in the profession, and recognizing the power of food production in revitalizing their communities.

“I’m in part of this return generation—young Black farmers who are returning to the land after having skipped a generation,” she says.

But in order for Taylor to make her newfound mission to provide organic fruits and vegetables to her adopted community in D.C. a sustainable operation, Taylor also had to rely on her diplomacy skillset.

The “I Want D.C. to Grow” Campaign

During her years as a farm hand, Taylor rose from volunteer to member of the vegetable crew to co-manager for the farm. In that time, she learned the most successful strategies for growing vegetables in the D.C. region, where warmer temperatures alter the growing season, as well as how to run that farm’s 485-member CSA.

But after five seasons, Taylor grew tired of the 90-minute round-trip commute. With ideas on starting her own organic farm that she could bike to, she found a two-acre plot of unused land owned by the Oblates of Mary Immaculate, a Catholic order of missionaries.

Within D.C.’s 68 square miles, small plots of land then were being cultivated to grow food to donate to low-income residents. There also were gardens set up to teach people how to grow vegetables. “But at that time in 2012, we didn’t have a farm in D.C. that was dedicated solely to production,” Taylor says.

While the Oblates supported her mission, their attorney worried that leasing the land for a commercial farm could subject them to a property tax assessment. Passed down to Taylor, the bill could make it hard for her to get a farm up and growing.

“We needed a lower property tax rate on land that was in agricultural use, which actually is a model that people have done all over the country since the ’70s to save family farms,” Taylor says.

While hauling in compost to build up the farm’s soil, Taylor simultaneously worked with Councilmember Grosso, students at a pro bono legal clinic, and food and farming advocates on “I Want D.C. to Grow,” a policy campaign designed to support her own goal as well as others interested in farming in the city.

Their efforts led to the passage of the D.C. Urban Farming and Food Security Act, which allows a 90 percent reduction in property taxes to owners of vacant lots who create partnerships with independent urban farmers. Known locally as the “D.C. Farm Bill,” the legislation allows property owners who are exempt from taxation to pass the exemption to the farmer. It also allows would-be growers to submit proposals for leases to cultivate unused public land.

When the D.C. Farm Bill took effect in April 2015, Three Part Harmony became the first farm to benefit. Now, the policy is poised to clear a path for more urban farming in D.C. In 2020, the city’s tax and revenue department will implement the abatement procedures for property owners, says Ona Balkus, food policy director at the D.C. Office of Planning. Balkus is excited about the potential more production farms on unused city property, and even on rooftops.

“Once the urban farming tax abatement goes into effect, private properties will be eligible for the tax credit if they lease their land or their rooftops to urban farms,” Balkus says. “Given the high price of land in D.C., rooftop farms on new real estate developments are a promising way to bring more fresh food to District residents.”

A year after requesting proposals, the city is expected to finalize five-year lease deals with two applicants this fall. Jeremy Brosowsky, who since 2010 has run a business that provides compost to urban farms, is one of those applicants. He credits the “I Want D.C. to Grow” campaign for making his idea possible.

“If this program didn’t exist, the farm couldn’t exist,” Brosowsky said. “Gail is an important advocate for the community and a talented and relentless urban farmer.”

Organic Production in the City

During the years she spent working on the D.C. Farm Bill, Taylor couldn’t sell any of the vegetables she was growing on the Oblates’ property. To earn start-up money, she built a greenhouse in her backyard and began supplying starter plants to local hardware stores and neighbors operating community gardens. She also launched a small, porch-style CSA, which she ran by growing vegetables in her backyard and in the backyards of friends and neighbors.

Heading into its eighth season, Three Part Harmony offers pesticide-free vegetables, herbs, and cut flowers. Designed as an “edible landscape,” the cultivated rows on the farm’s two-acre plot feature three-foot walkways to allow visitors to “get up close with their food.” Taylor’s technique also includes the companion planting of crops that enhance each other’s growth. She might plant a row of bunching onions and come in three weeks later with romaine lettuce.

“We’re constantly putting in things that can share space together,” Taylor says.

To add nutrients and organics to the soil and allow it to rest between plantings, Taylor also plants a third of the farm with oats, rye, and crimson clover as cover crops, or “green manure.”

A Group Effort

Three Part Harmony takes its name from her father’s often-repeated description of the collaborations her family of musicians created together. Its organic growth is due to efforts of the community of friends and neighbors Taylor has cultivated who come together and do their part, she says.

In addition to volunteers who help with the harvest, some CSA members donate their front porches to Taylor to help with distribution.

They also help build the farm’s online presence and offer professional bodywork to help Taylor and her two part-time farm hands recover after long days of planting and harvesting. A family member created the farm’s logo, which pays homage to the Monarch butterfly and Taylor’s family’s path during the Great Migration.

Taylor has enlisted nearby orchards and farms run by women and farmers of color to add variety—products like fruit, cheese, honey, rice, herbal items, and eggs—to her weekly CSA menu.

“Two years ago, when we went from under 100 members to over 100, my staff and I went around to all of those farms and said, ‘We want to scale up. This is what we need,’” recalls Taylor. “That was the first time [other farms] started setting aside some of their acreage and growing just for us.”

One of those growers is Gale Livingstone, a former government IT contractor, who met Taylor at a conference for new farmers. They bonded over the novelty of being young African American women launching production farms. Livingstone began providing organic eggs and vegetables for Taylor’s CSA.

This season Livingstone has relocated to a three-acre plot of land closer to D.C. “My long-term plan is that I’m trying to buy some land in Maryland—a much larger piece of land—so that I can incorporate animals into my operation,” Livingstone says. “I’m hoping to have Gail become an integral part of that—she’s super-organized and is great at managing people, which is one of the areas that I tend to need help with.”

A Deeper Connection

In addition to scaling up her CSA, Three Part Harmony has also donated food to soup kitchens and food pantries. Through her efforts at the farm and within the community, Taylor aims to build an operation that disrupts the historical racism and oppression upon which food systems have been operated, provide alternatives to corporate-based food production, and meet the community’s needs on a deeper level.

As residents within cities like D.C. seek greater food options and policy makers look to urban farming and community supported agriculture to solve challenges such as malnutrition, health disparities, and disinvestment in urban communities, Taylor’s work can serve as a model of urban farming that’s innovative and member-driven.

“People are going out of their way to support this CSA. They’re not saying, ‘I paid this much and this is what I’m getting out of it,’” Taylor says. “A lot of people are saying ‘I paid this much money, and I’m supporting these Black women farmers.’ We’re two right now, but maybe one day there will be more.”

Released Monday, the report ranks current and projected levels of walkable urbanism in the 30 largest U.S. metro areas based on land-use data and other development metrics, like rent premiums.

Walkable urban places feature high development density, lenient zoning rules, mixed uses, and multiple forms of transportation, according to the authors. A helpful rule of thumb for thinking about walkable areas is whether “destinations such as home, work, school, stores, and restaurants” are within a half-mile or so of a specific point. The report describes “761 regionally significant walkable urban places,” or “WalkUPs,” in the 30 metro areas studied.

“These WalkUPs occupy a minute portion of the total land mass of [those] areas (less than one percent), but deliver outsized economic performance,” write authors Tracy Hadden Loh, Christopher B. Leinberger, and Jordan Chafetz. The report, titled “Foot Traffic Ahead,” was produced in partnership with real estate firm Cushman & Wakefield, nonprofit organization Smart Growth America/LOCUS, and research and data company Yardi Matrix, per a release.

The D.C. region ranked fourth for walkable urbanism as of today, behind New York, Denver, and Boston. In both the Boston and D.C. metros, more than 40 percent of occupied WalkUP space is located in suburbs seeing development, the report says. Northern Virginia’s Reston Town Center and Maryland’s downtown Bethesda and Silver Spring are cited as examples of this pattern. “Even Tysons in Northern Virginia, the prototypical ‘Edge City’ of the late 20th century, is urbanizing about 40 percent of its 2,400 acres, evolving into 4 to 5 WalkUPs, as a result of four new Metrorail stations opening in 2014”—for the Silver Line—the report notes.

The authors make a key distinction between walkable urban and “drivable sub-urban” areas:

“Many readers may be used to thinking of the land in metropolitan areas in the U.S. as divided into three categories: ‘central city,’ ‘suburban,’ and ‘exurban.’ However, emerging 21st century development patterns suggest that the exurban typology is less meaningful for where the economy focuses its location, and we need categories driven by measures of urban form and economic activity, rather than absolute or relative spatial location, to examine and understand contemporary and future metropolitan development in the United States. The more useful dichotomy to understand metropolitan America is ‘walkable urban’ and ‘drivable sub-urban’ development. Both types of development can occur in either a metro’s central city or in a metro’s suburban area.”

Drivable sub-urban areas are characterized by low density, homogenous building types, heavy motor-vehicle activity, and separated land uses. As for the D.C. area, it also ranked fourth for what the report refers to as “future growth momentum,” a measure of changes in market share and rent premiums for office, retail, and multifamily space from 2010 to 2018.

The study, which was funded by the Greater Washington Partnership and JPMorgan Chase, also says 220,000 families who have annual incomes below $75,000 and are spread across 296 census tracts, may face displacement due to rising housing costs.

The numbers put a fine point on the region’s affordable housing crisis as its economy stands to continue growing with the advent of Amazon’s Northern Virginia headquarters and other employment opportunities. The researchers are calling for local governments to implement a slew of strategies to make housing more accessible to people of various incomes, including by preserving existing affordable housing and removing barriers to new development. Still, they note that “there is no silver bullet” in the public or private sectors for addressing these issues.

“Inaction on housing affordability challenges could ultimately undermine the region’s future economic growth and prosperity,” the authors write in an abstract to the report. “Housing challenges like these can undermine worker productivity, make it harder for companies to attract and retain employees, and discourage companies from locating in the area. Recent job and population trends suggest that housing constraints and affordability challenges may already be slowing employment growth and causing people to leave the Washington region.”

The projected 374,000 new homes needed by 2030—derived from an economic growth rate calculated by the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments—assumes no families would have to pay more than 30 percent of their incomes on housing. Among experts, that threshold is commonly defined as being “cost-burdened” by housing. The researchers say 40 percent of these additional units would have to be in the low-middle and middle housing cost bands, while another 38 percent would have to be in the lowest and low cost bands, to match the need. (The cost bands range from $0 to $799 per month to $3,500 or above per month.)

Meanwhile, according to the Urban Institute, increasing home values and property taxes are placing greater pressure on families to leave the area. Beyond the 220,000 families who are most at risk of displacement, another 99,000 families also with incomes below $75,000 per year live in communities that are “vulnerable” to displacement. Four regional jurisdictions—Prince George’s County, the District, Montgomery County, and Fairfax County—account for three-quarters of those at-risk and vulnerable households, or roughly 240,000 households; the biggest number live in Fairfax County, including Fairfax City and Falls Church (43,400).

The authors say government and business leaders should set benchmarks for boosting the production of new housing in the region, targeting funding at affordable housing programs, and tracking progress through data. The region may need to act quickly: A recent report by RentCafe found that apartment construction in the D.C. area is slowing despite the demand.",[]

Less than half of the households who live east of the Anacostia River, in Wards 7 and 8, have home broadband subscriptions letting them surf the web at high speeds, according to the D.C.-based Urban Institute. Culling new data from the U.S. Census Bureau, Urban finds that only 45 and 48 percent of households in Wards 7 and 8, respectively, have such service.

By contrast, 82 and 86 percent of households in Wards 2 and 3—which stretch roughly from Judiciary Square up to Friendship Heights, in Northwest—have broadband subscriptions at home. The average rate in the District is 70 percent, compared with a national average of 67 percent. (When dial-up service is included, 83 percent of D.C. households have web access.) The Urban Institute suggests these disparities could be hindering broader economic growth.

The differences are even greater between particular neighborhoods, with some Northeast neighborhoods seeing just 37 percent of households with broadband subscriptions, versus some Northwest neighborhoods seeing 90 percent rates. “If we closed the equity gap between the neighborhoods of Mayfair, Hillbrook, and Mahaning Heights, and DC overall, 1,061 more households would have a broadband internet subscription,” reports Urban. “If we set a goal to bring the broadband subscription rate in Ward 7 to 90 percent, 13,551 more households would be connected.” The data represent five-year estimates from a Census Bureau survey.

Urban author Leah Hendey outlines a series of possible reasons for the internet inequities, including the cost of broadband subscriptions, the lack of computers in some households, and widespread smartphone access. “Strategies to reduce the cost of broadband internet, ensure all neighborhoods have reliable and high-speed broadband, and provide digital literacy and technology training can improve equity and reduce the digital divide,” she writes.

A new study puts numbers to something most people in the region probably already sensed: The D.C. area’s traffic is among the worst in the nation, and it’s getting worse.

The 2019 Urban Mobility Report, by the Texas A&M University Transportation Institute, found that the average D.C.-area car commuter spends 102 hours a year stuck in traffic.

That’s the third-worst total in the nation, and that number, based on 2017 data, is up from 99 hours in 2016, 96 in 2015, 90 in 2012 and 36 in 1982.

That’s not all: The average car commuter in the area wastes 38 gallons of gasoline — that’s second in the nation — and between the gas and extra maintenance, spends an extra $1,840 per year because of congestion, also third in the country.

Tom Costello, the transportation correspondent for NBC News, told WTOP there was a bright side — D.C. isn’t No. 1 (that would be Los Angeles with a whopping 119 hours of congestion per commuter), and “a lot of that is because we’ve got a good economy; we’ve got nearly full employment.”

OK, that’s it for the bright side.

The underrated causes of D.C.-area traffic include what Costello called “the Uber and Lyft factor.”

The original perception was that people would give up using their own cars in order to use the ride-hailing services, but in fact, people are giving up mass transit to use the services, Costello said. A different recent study found that 7% of the D.C. area’s traffic comes from Uber and Lyft.

It’s a structural problem, Costello said, and the study agrees: improving roads will only have a “modest effect” on traffic, the study said. The solution requires changes in how people commute.

“There is more of an appetite than ever for trying to carpool, to cut down on the number of vehicles on the road,” Costello said. He cited the increase of telecommuting and added, “Let’s hope Metro continues to improve.”

“I think it is pretty clear that everything isn’t happening enough,” Tim Lomax, a research fellow at the transportation institute and co-author of the report, told The Associated Press.

Following the recession that began in 2008, officials predicted changes in commuting patterns — transit use, carpooling and more reliance on off-peak travel — would solidify and start to change habits.

“Our data just doesn’t show that,” Lomax said, referring to the updated estimates. “It shows that there is a pretty direct link between economic growth and congestion.”

As for the timing, the D.C. area’s traffic gets worse at about the times one would expect: The 4 p.m. and 5 p.m. hours on weekdays are generally the worst, with a bit of a bump in the 3 p.m. hour on Fridays, and the 5 p.m. Friday hour not quite as bad as on other weekdays. In the morning, the 7 a.m. and 8 a.m. hours are the worst, except for Fridays, which aren’t so bad.

The five worst metropolitan areas:

Los Angeles San Francisco D.C. New York Boston

The least busy: Kokomo, Indiana, with only eight hours of delays per year; Lawton, Oklahoma, with six; and Kailua, Hawaii, with only three hours of traffic a year.

The report projects the problem to get even worse nationwide: The cost of congestion across the U.S. will grow from $166 billion in 2017 to $200 billion in 2025.

The report was compiled from data from INRIX and the Federal Highway Administration. You can read the whole report and the page for the D.C. area on the institute’s website.

The forest, off Browns Mill Road, will be made up of fruit and nut-bearing trees, bushes, shrubs, and garden plots. This will provide fresh produce to an area of the city that is currently classified as food insecure.

“A food forest is kind of like a community garden. …” Smith said. “The people that live around here can come over and enhance dinner.”

It’s all part of an effort to ensure that 85 percent of Atlanta residents are within half a mile of fresh food by 2021, according to Atlanta City Councilmember Carla Smith, who has led the project.

Atlanta City Council recently unanimously agreed to purchase the land and transform the space, with the help of a grant from the United State Forest Service’s Community Food Service program.

ATLANTA (AP) — On his way home, Darnell Eleby paused before boarding the commuter train in Atlanta's Five Points station and maneuvered his wheelchair to a stop not seen on many mass transit platforms: a fresh food stand stocked with colorful fruits and vegetables. Aided by a volunteer, he filled a basket with bananas, apples, corn and squash and paid with a health program voucher.

""It helps you out when you can't get to the store,"" Eleby said.

In Chicago, nonprofit groups have opened health clinics where staff provide patients with nutrition education and free coupons to area farmers markets replete with healthy foods. Both cities also have encouraged burgeoning efforts to plant urban gardens.

Large cities across the country are using this multipronged approach to bring healthy diets to ""food deserts,"" mostly low-income neighborhoods located miles away from the nearest supermarket. They hope not only to reduce rates of diabetes, high blood pressure and obesity, but to encourage community activism and empowerment.

""We're doing this out of ... responsibility toward our community,"" Safia Rashid said of the garden she and her husband, Kamau Rashid, have tended on Chicago's South Side for the past 14 years.

The 44-year-old mother said the couple began gardening when their oldest son was 3 years old, to fight ""'food apartheid' ... folks deliberately disinvesting in this community, removing healthy food away from us,"" Safia Rashid said.

The Rashids' garden grows at the South Chicago Farm, a 14-acre (5.6-hectare) site developed in 2015. It's one of eight such farms in Chicago operated by the nonprofit Urban Growers Collective.

In Atlanta, many of the tomatoes, peaches and peppers found in bins at the Fresh MARTA Markets come from food grown in the city and nearby farms, said Hilary King, of the nonprofit Community Farmers Markets, which partners with the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority to run the stands. Launched in 2015, the MARTA markets are located at different stations during the week.

""We cannot rely on traditional retail methods,"" said Atlanta urban agriculture director Mario Cambardella.

Nonprofits also have teamed up with ridesharing company Lyft to provide up to 300 low-income families with discounted rides to farmers markets and grocery stores in Atlanta. The six-month pilot program, called Access AgLanta, began June 1, inspired by a similar Lyft partnership in Washington, D.C.

""What we have often heard over the years is that transportation is a huge barrier to food access,"" said Alysa Moore, program manager for Georgia Fresh For Less, which provides state residents who receive food stamps with financial assistance to shop at farmers markets.

Eleby relies heavily on the transit platform markets. Without them, he said, he'd be forced to rely on a small scattering of stores in his low-income neighborhood in southwest Atlanta where he said he has to smell food or examine it for mold before buying it. The food there, he said, isn't ""like it's supposed to be.""

As of 2015, roughly 22% of Atlanta's population was living in a low-income community more than a mile from a food store, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

In Chicago, that number is 5%. Comparatively, the number in Seattle is 7.8%; Washington, D.C., 6.4%; Baltimore, 4.3%; and Milwaukee, 3.5%, according to the USDA.

Christopher ""Mad Dog"" Thomas, 34, who grew up in the Altgeld Gardens neighborhood on Chicago's South Side, said he has suffered from ""'food desert eating disorder,' where all you can afford to eat is candy.""

Thomas and his wife, Kathryn Gatewood, make a weekly trip outside their neighborhood to a store called Pete's Supermarket, which Kathryn Gatewood describes as ""the black or Hispanic Whole Foods.""

""We spend almost 40% of our paychecks combined to ensure a healthier diet for our kids,"" she said, adding that it is a better alternative than buying bad food from the ""dusty shelves"" of corner stores in Englewood.

The Chicago nonprofit Inner-City Muslim Action Network has launched ""The Corner Store Campaign"" to change that.

Sami Defalla, who runs the Morgan Mini Mart in Englewood, has been an active partner with the campaign for more than two years. Defalla has created a ""green zone"" in the store where shoppers can purchase inexpensive fresh fruits and vegetables.

""I wish I had a bigger platform to offer more ... to my customers,"" Deffala said.

The Muslim Action Network also operates a health clinic where patients can see a dietitian free of charge and receive coupons for free produce at the nearby farmers market. Every Friday, the group hosts a farmers market where residents can connect with local urban farmers.

As a volunteer in a community garden in Atlanta, Celeste Lomax is finally able to take fresh produce home to her low-income neighborhood, which is located about 4 miles (6.4 kilometers) away from the nearest supermarket.

""We have a right to eat healthy like everyone else does,"" she said.

https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/atlantas-urban-design-storefront-brings-planning-to-the-people,['Atlanta'],Atlanta’s Urban Design Storefront Brings Planning to the People,"On a weekday afternoon in southwest Atlanta, passersby round a street corner and walk by a windowed storefront. Perhaps they catch a glimpse inside of the aerial map of Atlanta, covered in sun-faded sticky notes. Or maybe they see people working and talking at desks.

Either way, the City of Atlanta hopes these passersby open the door.

Atlanta City Studio is a pop-up storefront meant to involve the public in the urban design process. Operated by the city’s Department of City Planning, the pop-up invites anyone to walk in, talk with the city’s urban designers and collaborate on ideas for projects. City staff are there to answer questions and give the public a way to get their ideas for improving their neighborhoods in front of the right people. Oh, and if you have a question about a broken water meter or a pothole, the studio can help you with that, too.

Atlanta City Studio opened in 2016 at Ponce City Market, a repurposed historic building with a food hall and shopping. In 2017, the pop-up moved to its present location in Cascade Heights, a historically black neighborhood. The story of how Atlanta City Studio came to Cascade Heights highlights its public-facing nature. The Cascade Heights Community Development Corporation invited the city to tour the neighborhood, hoping to eventually revitalize the business corridor.

“We knew that [the studio] would draw a lot of resources that we needed and it would also shine a light on the neighborhood,” says Corliss Claire, secretary and founding member of the community development corporation. “Development is coming in this direction, but we want to make certain that we stay on top of it.”

Cascade Heights is one of the last areas near downtown Atlanta that has swaths of available land for development. Claire, who has lived in Cascade Heights since 2002, says this is a critical moment to help guide future growth while preserving the neighborhood’s character.

So in April 2017, the studio opened in Cascade Heights. It has six full-time staff members and one fellowship student.

“They’ve become an essential part of the community,” Claire says.

The studio began by listening to residents and learning what they had already accomplished and what they wanted for the future. “We put their work on up the walls alongside city designs and tried to tease out what those projects were,” says Kevin Bacon, director of Atlanta City Studio.

Six months into its tenure there, the studio identified projects to work on in Cascade Heights. This has included making Beecher Street, a major connection, more walkable, and working with the community to design and build a custom bus shelter that has real-time bus signage and landscaped planters. Ideas came from the CDC and others in the community.

The studio brings its own expertise as well. CDC asked the studio to hold a session with business property owners about how to improve their storefronts, Claire says. It went beyond that. The studio ended up offering a matching grant program, giving eligible property owners up to $20,000 for facade improvements. By the time the program finished in summer 2018, five businesses had received the storefront redesign grant, and the city has launched a similar grant program in the West End neighborhood.

In addition to speaking with the public about design projects, the studio has recurring events every month to engage people: a book club, a lunchtime forum and a morning discussion over doughnuts. People and groups can also use the studio space for meetings.

The studio is not only a public-facing design arm. It also represents the city as a whole. A staff member is always on duty to answer any questions, even if they aren’t design-related. “If this is your first touchpoint with city government, we want it to be a really good experience and point you in the right direction,” says Sonia Sequeira, the studio’s manager of community engagement.

Atlanta City Studio’s more than two years in Cascade Heights is coming to an end as it moves to another part of the city. Though some Cascade Heights projects have finished, others are still in progress. The studio worked on the design of the Beecher Street walkability project, and the next step is to find funding. It will continue its support of the project even after leaving the neighborhood.

Another project has envisioned how to bring additional housing to the business quarter. The studio has coached the CDC on how to promote this vision going forward.

“We would never have been able to solidify our ideas and our visions for the future for the business quarter and also for the immediately surrounding neighborhood without the resources that the studio has,” Claire says. “[For] a government entity, I don’t usually have these kinds of glowing praises.”

She adds that a community of color is not one that normally gets this kind of attention.

The next stop for Atlanta City Studio is south downtown, where it will open in late summer. Among the most notable development coming is Centennial Yards, a 40-acre, mixed-use mini city within downtown.

Bacon says designers can play a role in shaping change coming to that area.

“When you look at south downtown, among a lot of the other places that you could make arguments for, everything that’s about to happen right there just begs having us in the middle of it to be a shaping force.”",[]
https://edition.cnn.com/2019/05/24/us/atlanta-food-forest-fighting-food-desert/index.html,['Atlanta'],This southern city is fighting food deserts with a forest of free produce,"(CNN) Among the heavily trafficked streets of Atlanta, a massive urban food forest is growing to provide fresh produce for the public.

But what exactly is a food forest?

In the fight against food deserts -- low income areas that lack access to fresh, whole foods -- a food forest is a public space in the city where fresh produce will grow in trees, bushes, plants, and community garden beds for the community to enjoy.

And at 7.1 acres, the site in Atlanta will become the city's first and the nation's largest.

In the Lakewood-Browns Mill community, which will house the Urban Food Forest, more than a third of the population lives below the poverty line, according to the USDA , who has assisted in the project.

https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/08/14/magazine/traffic-atlanta-segregation.html,['Atlanta'],How Segregation Caused Your Traffic Jam,"Atlanta has some of the worst traffic in the United States. Drivers there average two hours each week mired in gridlock, hung up at countless spots, from the constantly clogged Georgia 400 to a complicated cluster of overpasses at Tom Moreland Interchange, better known as “Spaghetti Junction.” The Downtown Connector — a 12-to-14-lane megahighway that in theory connects the city’s north to its south — regularly has three-mile-long traffic jams that last four hours or more. Commuters might assume they’re stuck there because some city planner made a mistake, but the heavy congestion actually stems from a great success. In Atlanta, as in dozens of cities across America, daily congestion is a direct consequence of a century-long effort to segregate the races.

For much of the nation’s history, the campaign to keep African-Americans “in their place” socially and politically manifested itself in an effort to keep them quite literally in one place or another. Before the Civil War, white masters kept enslaved African-Americans close at hand to coerce their labor and guard against revolts. But with the abolition of slavery, the spatial relationship was reversed. Once they had no need to keep constant watch over African-Americans, whites wanted them out of sight. Civic planners pushed them into ghettos, and the segregation we know today became the rule.

At first the rule was overt, as Southern cities like Baltimore and Louisville enacted laws that mandated residential racial segregation. Such laws were eventually invalidated by the Supreme Court, but later measures achieved the same effect by more subtle means. During the New Deal, federal agencies like the Home Owners’ Loan Corporation and the Federal Housing Administration encouraged redlining practices that explicitly marked minority neighborhoods as risky investments and therefore discouraged bank loans, mortgages and insurance there. Other policies simply targeted black communities for isolation and demolition. The postwar programs for urban renewal, for instance, destroyed black neighborhoods and displaced their residents with such regularity that African-Americans came to believe, in James Baldwin’s memorable phrase, that “urban renewal means Negro removal.”

This intertwined history of infrastructure and racial inequality extended into the 1950s and 1960s with the creation of the Interstate highway system. The federal government shouldered nine-tenths of the cost of the new Interstate highways, but local officials often had a say in selecting the path. As in most American cities in the decades after the Second World War, the new highways in Atlanta — local expressways at first, then Interstates — were steered along routes that bulldozed “blighted” neighborhoods that housed its poorest residents, almost always racial minorities. This was a common practice not just in Southern cities like Jacksonville, Miami, Nashville, New Orleans, Richmond and Tampa, but in countless metropolises across the country, including Chicago, Cincinnati, Denver, Detroit, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, Milwaukee, Pittsburgh, St. Louis, Syracuse and Washington.

While Interstates were regularly used to destroy black neighborhoods, they were also used to keep black and white neighborhoods apart. Today, major roads and highways serve as stark dividing lines between black and white sections in cities like Buffalo, Hartford, Kansas City, Milwaukee, Pittsburgh and St. Louis. In Atlanta, the intent to segregate was crystal clear. Interstate 20, the east-west corridor that connects with I-75 and I-85 in Atlanta’s center, was deliberately plotted along a winding route in the late 1950s to serve, in the words of Mayor Bill Hartsfield, as “the boundary between the white and Negro communities” on the west side of town. Black neighborhoods, he hoped, would be hemmed in on one side of the new expressway, while white neighborhoods on the other side of it would be protected. Racial residential patterns have long since changed, of course, but the awkward path of I-20 remains in place.

By razing impoverished areas downtown and segregating the races in the western section, Atlanta’s leaders hoped to keep downtown and its surroundings a desirable locale for middle-class whites. Articulating a civic vision of racial peace and economic progress, Hartsfield bragged that Atlanta was the “City Too Busy to Hate.” But the so-called urban renewal and the new Interstates only helped speed white flight from Atlanta. Over the 1960s, roughly 60,000 whites left the city, with many of them relocating in the suburbs along the northern rim. When another 100,000 whites left the city in the 1970s, it became a local joke that Atlanta had become “The City Too Busy Moving to Hate.”

As the new suburbs ballooned in size, traffic along the poorly placed highways became worse and worse. The obvious solution was mass transit — buses, light rail and trains that would more efficiently link the suburbs and the city — but that, too, faced opposition, largely for racial reasons. The white suburbanites had purposefully left the problems of the central city behind and worried that mass transit would bring them back.

Accordingly, suburbanites waged a sustained campaign against the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority (MARTA) from its inception. Residents of the nearly all-white Cobb County resoundingly rejected the system in a 1965 vote. In 1971, Gwinnett and Clayton Counties, which were then also overwhelmingly white, followed suit, voting down a proposal to join MARTA by nearly 4-1 margins, and keeping MARTA out became the default position of many local politicians. (Emmett Burton, a Cobb County commissioner, won praise for promising to “stock the Chattahoochee with piranha” if that were needed to keep MARTA away.) David Chesnut, the white chairman of MARTA, insisted in 1987 that suburban opposition to mass transit had been “90 percent a racial issue.” Because of that resistance, MARTA became a city-only service that did little to relieve commuter traffic. By the mid-1980s, white racists were joking that MARTA, with its heavily black ridership, stood for “Moving Africans Rapidly Through Atlanta.”

Even as the suburbs became more racially diverse, they remained opposed to MARTA. After Gwinnett voted the system down again in 1990, a former Republican legislator later marveled at the arguments given by opponents. “They will come up with 12 different ways of saying they are not racist in public,” he told a reporter. “But you get them alone, behind a closed door, and you see this old blatant racism that we have had here for quite some time.”

Earlier this year, Gwinnett County voted MARTA down for a third time. Proponents had hoped that changes in the county’s racial composition, which was becoming less white, might make a difference. But the March initiative still failed by an eight-point margin. Officials discovered that some nonwhite suburbanites shared the isolationist instincts of earlier white suburbanites. One white property manager in her late 50s told a reporter that she voted against mass transit because it was used by poorer residents and immigrants, whom she called “illegals.” “Why should we pay for it?” she asked. “Why subsidize people who can’t manage their money and save up a dime to buy a car?”

In the end, Atlanta’s traffic is at a standstill because its attitude about transit is at a standstill, too. Fifty years after its Interstates were set down with an eye to segregation and its rapid-transit system was stunted by white flight, the city is still stalled in the past.",[]

Change is hard.

We are witnessing that fact every day – whether it be turning one-way streets into two-way streets or whether it be introducing 10,000 e-scooters on our city’s streets in the past year.

It all comes down to a simple fact. We are readjusting the way we are moving around in Atlanta. We are shifting from a car-oriented transportation network to one that includes multiple modes – pedestrians, cyclists, transit riders and users of the myriad of micro-mobility modes that have emerged on our streets, trails and sidewalks.

But not everyone is embracing the change – as we found out with the proposal to turn six blocks of Baker Street downtown from a one way corridor to a two-way street.

After the legislation was approved by the Atlanta City Council in an 11-4 vote, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms surprisingly vetoed it.

“A lot of concerns have been raised,” Mayor Bottoms said in a brief interview after the ribbon-cutting of the Atlanta BeltLine’s Eastside Trail north of Memorial Drive. “Out of an abundance of caution, I wanted to be sure we have addressed their concerns. We have an opportunity to take a step back, to give everyone the assurance that their concerns are being addressed.”

Asked if the two-way proposal was still on the table, the mayor answered without hesitation: “Absolutely.”

Bottoms said the is continuing to get input from the those who would be impacted by making all of Baker Street two ways – the residents, the business community, including downtown hotels among others.

“It is an opportunity to take a step back and make sure we have done our due diligence. We want to make this transition as safe as possible. There’s never any harm in slowing this process down,” said Bottoms, who added that she doesn’t have “over-arching concerns” about the proposal.

She also said she had met with Tim Keane, the city’s planning commissioner, to discuss her veto.

“Tim Keane is a seasoned professional,” Bottoms said. “I trust his judgement.”

One can attribute part of Atlanta’s changing transportation habits to the BeltLine – trails that serve pedestrian, cyclists, skateboarders, skaters, e-scooters, e-bikes and other means of movement.

As an example of how the BeltLine has changed our psyche, Mayor Bottoms admitted at the ribbon-cutting that 10 years ago, she had heard about the BeltLine “but I probably couldn’t tell you what it was.” Now it has changed the profile of Atlanta.

Downtown is not the only area changing its focus from cars to pedestrians.

The Midtown Alliance is planning to turn one-way thoroughfares into two-way streets. The Midtown Alliance has several plans to change the feel of one of the hottest real estate markets in the Atlanta region.

Kevin Green, president and CEO of the Midtown Alliance, recently revealed the results of an extensive survey of people who live and/or work in Midtown.

One interesting response was that “94 percent agree that Midtown is no longer a place to go through,” Green said. Instead it is a destination – a place to experience and enjoy. Green said there are 70 lane miles within the 1.2 square mile that makes up Midtown. Plans call for reducing only 8 percent of that space for alternative modes of transportation.

The survey revealed support for a shift in priorities.

When asked about which modes of transportation should be a priority, 96 percent answered walking; 90 percent said transit; 79 percent said cycling; 42 percent said dockless scooters and the lowest priority was cars with 39 percent.

Scooters were non-existent in Atlanta before May 2018. Today there are about 10,000 scooters offered by 10 vendors. It’s become a little bit like the wild, wild west on Atlanta’s streets.

But at the monthly Sustainable Atlanta Roundtable event at Southface on July 12, there was consensus that the scooters are here to stay.

“It’s better to have a 40-pound scooter than a two-ton car” competing for space on our cities streets, said Shaun Green, senior transportation engineer for Atlanta BeltLine Inc. Green said that just one of the vendors – Lime – had one million rides in just one year; and he added that 37 percent of scooter rides are replacing a car trip.

“The best part about scooters is that people are no longer as pissed off at bicycles,” Green said jokingly.

When it comes to scooters, the rules of the road and the sidewalk still need to be fine-tuned. Common courtesy goes a long way – no matter what mode of transportation one uses. And our streets need to be reconfigured to make them more welcoming to non-automobile modes of transportation.

My guess is that this micro-mobility revolution is in its infancy. As time goes on, my guess is that we will see different kinds of electric vehicles that would appeal to the over-50 demographic – seated scooters or even mini golf carts.

They all will play a part as we witness that transition from cars to a multimodal transportation system. Micro-mobility modes are becoming part of the “last-mile solution” – filling in the gaps that exist because of our limited transit network.

“How can we build a region where it’s easier and safer for everyone to walk and bike?” asked Byron Rushing, bicycling and walking program manager for the Atlanta Regional Commission, during the Southface panel discussion. “We need to build better streets. If there are no facilities for people to walk or bike safely, people are not going to walk or bike.”

An ARC study – “Walk, Bike, Thrive” – lays out the opportunities for the region. And it is not surprising that the change will begin in the city of Atlanta – where density and development is forcing a shift away from cars to alternative modes.

So it’s only a matter of time before Baker Street and several of our other one-way thoroughfares become two-way streets that are more inviting to those on foot, on bicycles or scooters. Complete streets, here we come.",[]
https://boston.curbed.com/2019/6/25/18716405/sprawl-boston-walkability,['Boston'],"Sprawl is over in the Boston area, report says","The Boston area is done sprawling.

That is according to a new report tracking what it called the “761 regionally significant, walkable urban places” (or WalkUPs) in the 30 largest U.S. metro areas.

Some 31 percent of the Boston region’s income-producing office, retail, and multifamily properties is now within an existing WalkUp, according to the report from George Washington University’s Center for Real Estate and Urban Analysis, developer coalition LOCUS/Smart Growth America, research site Yardi Matrix, and brokerage Cushman & Wakefield.

What’s more, 99 precent of the net change in the supply of office and multifamily in the Boston region from 2010 to 2018 was in these eminently walkable areas. And 40 percent of the WalkUP space in the region is in its suburbs or in cities just beyond Boston.

“Like election results, it is possible to ‘call’ an end of sprawl in metropolitan Boston in office, retail, and rental multi-family housing...,” according to the report. “The Boston metro serves as a likely harbinger of the new walkable urban development era in the U.S.”

Indeed, the Boston region is basically a national model for walkable urban real estate that is not single-family housing—the report’s research did not include anything related to that—one other metros, such as New York and Washington, might soon follow it in largely eliminating car-dependent sprawl from its office, retail, and multifamily markets.

“This analysis examines income-producing real estate, and does not include single-family housing, which is a primary driver of sprawling development,” the report said. “However, within these market-driven product types (office, retail, and rental multifamily), we observe that in metro Boston drivable suburban development may be reaching its end.”

How has the region gotten to this point? The report, “2019 Foot Traffic Ahead,” posits a few theories.

There is a significant amount of “historic walkable urban (pre-1930s) neighborhoods to redevelop” in Boston and Cambridge in particular.

The tech industry is driving much of the region’s economy, and its workers and companies by and large want reliable transportation that doesn’t revolve around privately owned cars (witness the recent call from Kendall Square business leaders for more funding for the T).

There is that “extensive, though perpetually underfunded” T, which makes non-vehicular transportation more possible.

The region has “one of the highest levels of walkable urbanism in the suburbs, now including brownfield development (Cambridgeport) in addition to suburban town center redevelopment (Cambridge).”

Finally, there’s a more amorphous reason that the report’s authors just couldn’t quite define but that many residents might identify with: “Pride of place, while hard to quantify, but Bostonians have remarkable pride in their city and metro area, even referring to it as the ‘hub of the universe.’”

The prominence of walkability in Boston-area real estate, and the resultant decline if not death of sprawl in the region, is in keeping with a larger trend.

Ten of the 30 metro areas that the report tracked are gaining economic market share three times faster than their 2010 base market share. The last time there was so pronounced a shift, the report said, was in the 1980s—when market share was going in the opposite direction, toward suburbs that workers, shoppers, and residents had to drive to, and away from urban areas.

The report also found that for-sale homes in WalkUps in the top 30 metros sell at a​ 90 percent premium and rentals lease at a 46 percent premium compared with their counterparts outside of WalkUps in the metros’ overall markets.

Altogether, it’s a shift toward the urban and away from the suburban in work-life that could have profound effects on the U.S. economy.

“This trend suggests substantial future demand for additional WalkUPs in all metropolitan areas, especially within the urbanizing suburbs,” Christopher B. Leinberger, chairman of the Center for Real Estate and Urban Analysis and co-author of the report, said in a statement. “This demand for new WalkUPs, along with the growth of existing WalkUPs, puts a new foundation under the U.S. economy, similar to that resulting from the building of drivable suburbs in the mid- to late 20t​h​ century.”",[]
https://bostonrealestatetimes.com/boston-mayor-walsh-announces-design-of-city-hall-plaza-renovation/,['Boston'],Boston Mayor Walsh Announces Design of City Hall Plaza Renovation,"BOSTON – Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh announced the renovation concept design of Boston City Hall Plaza. The renovation will transform the Plaza into a civic space for all residents, with universal accessibility, new civic spaces for all to use, increased environmental sustainability, and critical infrastructure improvements that will ensure the Plaza is safe and accessible for all for generations to come.

“Boston’s City Hall Plaza is a space visited by thousands of Boston residents each and every day,” said Mayor Walsh. “This renovation will turn our seven-acre space into a welcoming, accessible space for all, featuring new civic spaces for events to areas for families to enjoy together. Creating a new People’s Plaza will help us achieve our goals of making one of Boston’s most-used public spaces better for all residents.”

The seven-acre plaza is one of the City’s largest civic spaces and for the last 50 years it has hosted events ranging from sports celebrations and rallies, to seasonal cultural festivals. The Plaza’s sustainable and forward-thinking renovation will bring Boston’s City Hall Plaza up to 21st-century standards, and create a Plaza that is welcoming and accessible for all residents and visitors. The Plaza design is created by Sasaki, a global design firm specializing in urban design.

Phase 1 of the project will deliver updated civic spaces and programming capabilities, as well as add infrastructure that will make the Plaza more sustainable, including connecting Congress and Cambridge Streets with an accessible sloped Promenade activated by 21st century civic amenities like shady seating and gathering areas, a destination play space, public art space and an iconic water feature.

City Hall Plaza’s redesign includes a focus on:

A Welcoming Front Yard for Civic Life

With Boston’s renovated City Hall Plaza, this community space will become universally accessible for residents of all abilities. Opening up the Plaza for all will include re-opening the second floor of City Hall Plaza to the public, allowing easier access to the building. This public-facing entrance was closed in 2001, and will open again under the new renovation plan.

The renovation also includes 3,000 new welcoming spaces for residents to sit, 12,000 square feet of playscapes for children and families, and 11,000 square feet of terraces for pop-up play and interactive public art.

Flexible and Accommodating Event Venues

Boston City Hall Plaza renovation will right-size one of Boston’s largest event spaces, and create civic event spaces that can be used by all Boston residents. The renovation includes creating seven new “plug and play” locations for community groups to utilize, with space for 10,000 – 12,0000 visitors on the main Plaza, and room for a 20,000 – 25,000 person gathering on the entire Plaza.

The new design will also include three smaller event and gathering places, and a new civic building on Congress Street, equipped with a bathroom and other facilities to support public gatherings.

A Model of Sustainability and Resilience

Creating a sustainable City Hall Plaza that meets the City’s environmental goals is one of the key parts of the Plaza renovation, and this renovation will make City Hall Plaza one of Boston’s signature civic spaces environmentally sustainable, meeting Boston’s resilience standards.

The renovation includes an increase in permeable surfaces that will soak up stormwater, planning ahead for severe weather in downtown Boston. The design also includes 100 new trees, improving the shade, scale and air quality of the Plaza. Fifty lights will be replaced with efficient LED technology, and 22,500 feet of granite and brick paving will be reused or recycled.

As part of the master planning process beginning in early 2015, Mayor Walsh engaged the community through dozens of public meetings and across social media to help crowdsource ideas on how to reimagine the Plaza. As the project has proceeded it has engaged, and will continue to engage, many stakeholders and impacted abutters and neighbors, including the MBTA and the U.S. General Services Administration, which concurrently has been masterplanning their own modern-era structures and neighboring and sites.

Funding for Phase 1 of the Plaza is included in Boston’s Capital Budget, announced earlier this year. Of this budget, $70 million in total project costs is designated to complete Phase 1 of the Boston City Hall Plaza renovation.

The $2.78 billion FY20-24 Capital Plan is how the City makes critical investments in the City’s capital assets, including schools, roads, bridges, bike lanes, libraries, and more. This year’s plan includes renewed public housing in Charlestown, revitalized parks in Dorchester, transportation improvements in Allston-Brighton, school improvements across the city, and fulfills Mayor Walsh’s commitment to dedicating over 10 percent of new city funding toward climate resilient projects. This plan ensures the municipal, civic and open space assets that residents cherish in their neighborhoods will remain active and vibrant parts of the community for years to come.

The Plaza design and implementation is led by global design firm Sasaki. The project is managed through the City’s Operations Cabinet by the Public Facilities Department in partnership with the Property Management Department and is assisted by owners project manager Skanska USA.

“Boston City Hall Plaza has long been Boston’s place to gather, celebrate and make residents’ voices heard,” said Isabel Zempel, Sasaki landscape principal. “This historic Plaza recently celebrated its 50th anniversary and these updates will bring the Plaza into the modern century with improved infrastructure, sustainability, and public spaces. The Plaza’s renovation will honor its original intentions and history, while making it a more accessible place for all.”

The current renovation project builds off the foundations of the Boston City Hall and Plaza Master Planning Study: Rethink City Hall. Released by Mayor Walsh in October 2017, the study was led by the City’s Public Facilities Department and design teams of Utile and Reed Hilderbrand. The study resulted in a 30-year master plan to address required repairs and to transform the 50-year-old City Hall and Plaza into an innovative, healthy, efficient and civic facility designed to better serve current and future generations of Bostonians and visitors.

Over 600 residents visit Boston City Hall on a daily basis, while 19,500 residents live within a half-mile of the Plaza, in addition to its 18 million annual tourist visitors. This renovation supports Mayor Walsh’s commitment to investing in civic spaces throughout Boston, and creating a City Hall that is accessible for all residents.

Previous work by the City to enhance the Plaza include seasonal events like The Patios: presented by Berkshire Bank along with the Boston Garden Development Corp., which reopened on Thursday, May 2 and Boston’s free summer lunch program for students on the Plaza, or Boston’s now-annual summer “lawn” popup piloted in partnership with the Mayor’s Office of New Urban Mechanics.

More information about the City Hall Plaza renovation is available on boston.gov. A public community meeting will be held at Boston City Hall Plaza on Wednesday, June 5th at 6:00 p.m. for a design presentation and discussion about the Plaza renovation.

https://www.fastcompany.com/90374868/america-has-fallen-out-of-love-with-the-suburbs,['Boston'],America has fallen out of love with the suburbs,"“There’s no leasing activity happening in the drivable suburbs,” says Tracy Hadden Loh, senior data scientists at the George Washington University School for Businesses’ Center for Real Estate and Urban Analysis. “All of the new demand for retail, office, and multifamily rental space is going to walkable, urban places.”

Those walkable, urban places, Loh adds, are not just located in downtown Boston. Adjacent cities, like Cambridge and Somerville, are well connected by transit and contain dense housing options, near shops and amenities, that people want to live in. Looking at the Boston metro area, Loh says, provides a window into what could be the landscape of America in the future: networks of dense, urbanized communities built out around core cities, and connected by non-car transit options like light rail, buses, and bike infrastructure.

This trend is not just limited to Boston. A new report from GWU and Smart Growth America (Loh is a co-author) finds that on the whole, America is falling out of love with the suburbs. It’s not the location of these places that is the issue, Loh and her co-authors find, but rather their design: sprawling communities of single-family homes that require a car to navigate are not what’s drawing people anymore. What’s popular now are places where people can live in mixed-use, multifamily housing—maybe an apartment building above a coffee shop—and walk, bike, or take transit to get around.

Foot Traffic Ahead: Ranking Walkable Urbanism in America’s Largest Metros counts 761 such communities throughout the 30 biggest metro areas in the U.S. In total, these mixed-use, walkable areas comprise less than 1% of the total land mass in the metro areas, but they delivery disproportionately significant economic benefits. While sprawling, suburban districts have added no new development and in some cases, lost occupancy since 2010, nearly all new office and multifamily housing construction has clustered in these 761 areas. In today’s “knowledge economy,” companies are finding they benefit from clustering near each other and in the midst of a strong labor pool—which they’ll find in the dense, walkable communities that younger and well-educated workers are increasingly seeking out.

A well-documented negative effect of this trend is high real estate prices. But, according to Loh, that’s only creating significant problems in the U.S. because wages for ordinary workers have stayed stagnant for decades, making it difficult for them to keep pace with housing costs, and because many cities have not met the growing demand for housing in walkable communities with adequate new construction. Yet even in places like New York and San Francisco where housing costs are high for these reasons, residents often save on transportation costs because it’s not necessary to have a car to get around.

Beyond raising wages for workers so they can afford to live where they work, Loh says that metro areas need to take concerted steps to support this trend toward walkable, urban communities. One lever, she says, is doing away with single-family zoning, which prohibits building mixed-use and multifamily developments. That’s already happening in some places: Minneapolis and the whole state of Oregon have recently banned single-family zoning. Another is rolling back requirements in many places that developers must add more parking to go along with new housing or commercial structures.",[]
https://rebusinessonline.com/demand-for-retail-space-surges-in-boston/,['Boston'],Demand for Retail Space Surges in Boston – REBusinessOnline,"Demand for Retail Space Surges in Boston

Boston’s urban core is seeing a healthy volume of new development, such as Arsenal Yards, a mixed-use project in Watertown that will ultimately feature 250,000 square feet of retail space. But with healthy demand from new retailers and restaurants, the market appears to be balanced.

Bolstered by strong growth in its millennial population and high-paying jobs, Boston’s urban core continues to boast one of the lowest retail vacancy rates in the country.

But this trend has also led to a wave of new development that could temper that good news for Boston retail owners.

According to data from Marcus & Millichap, metro Boston’s retail vacancy rate is expected to rise by 40 basis points from 3.2 percent to 3.6 percent in 2019, a year in which 1.3 million square feet of new projects are slated for completion.

By comparison, the national vacancy rate stood at 10.2 percent at the end of the first quarter, reports Reis. Marcus & Millichap predicts that the uptick in metro Boston’s retail vacancy will slow the pace of annual rent growth to 3.3 percent.

Population growth is fueling demand for housing, which in turn spurs demand for retail to serve those new residents. Metro Boston’s population has grown by more than 112,000 people over the last five years, according to Marcus & Millichap, and the area boasts a median household income in excess of $90,000.

While the local rate of population growth mirrors that of the United States as a whole, average household income is nearly 33 percent higher in Boston than in the rest of the country. In addition, the market added 23,560 new jobs during the 12-month period that ended March 31. That figure represents a decline from the previous 12-month period, but a healthy indicator nonetheless given that the bulk of those jobs were in the business and professional services sector.

In markets where the population is growing, retail developers and operators often look to the suburbs for new spaces and customers. But Boston’s urban core is experiencing inward migration, due not only to the aforementioned job and population growth, but also to the presence of vibrant new destinations.

As such, retail real estate professionals see little cause for concern in terms of oversupply. They expect key retail categories like food, fitness and entertainment to continue to drive positive absorption, particularly in submarkets located within the 128 loop.

Mixed-Use Projects Abound

Similar to the United States as a whole, the Boston retail market is over-retailed in the big box segment. But much like other primary markets, well-located properties with authentic, creditworthy tenants continue to perform well and attract strong demand from investors.

In addition, redevelopment projects that feature a mix of uses have brought elevated demand for retail space to growing submarkets. Such projects include Arsenal Yards, a mall redevelopment project in Watertown, and the Seaport District, located near South Boston.

At the same time, neighborhoods like Somerville and Brighton, which have traditionally been strong retail markets anchored by nearby college populations, are also seeing retail development within mixed-use settings. Assembly Row in Somerville offers several entertainment destinations — an AMC theater, Legoland and Lucky Strike Social — in addition to boutique dining and shopping options. In Brighton, the new Boston Landing development, which houses the world headquarters and flagship store of New Balance, is also seeing its retail and dining components come on line.

“The densification of Boston’s urban core is happening with high-rise residential and office projects,” says Manny Steiner, vice president of leasing at New England Development, a firm known locally for projects like CambridgeSide, which fronts the Charles River in East Cambridge and Chestnut Hill Square in Chestnut Hill. “With those projects, retail is often required by government authorities, and many developers see that component as an amenity that sets the tone for the rest of the building.”

Steiner also says that taking a mixed-use approach to retail development will be integral to balancing future supply in Boston’s suburbs, where much of the existing product is pure-play retail space. Big boxes and single-tenant properties have been hit by both slacking absorption and investor demand in the age of online shopping.

“The needs of retail in today’s urban core are more pedestrian, modest and transit-oriented than they were in the past,” says Steiner. “Today’s consumers want convenience above all else and are approaching retail from an omni-channel perspective. Much of the older retail space in the suburbs will need to be repurposed or reinvented.”

Corey Bialow, president and CEO of full-service brokerage firm Bialow Real Estate, notes that the emergence of new destinations is prompting retailers and restaurants that are new to the area to rethink their site selection strategies. This holds true in both neighborhoods that have high densities of retail space and which have always been hotbeds of pedestrian traffic, as well as in submarkets that lack those qualities.

In many cases, first-to-market concepts that have historically gone to neighborhoods close to downtown, like Fenway-Kenmore or Back Bay, are considering other submarkets that are experiencing population growth but which are more affordable.

“Historically, Boston has been a very difficult market for new tenants to enter. This is due in part to a large supply of older buildings, properties that carry restrictions that often limit landlords’ ability to meet the needs of tenants,” says Bialow. “But new projects have many modern amenities, such as larger floor plates, upgraded mechanical systems and parking garages that traditional retail hotbeds like Newbury Street can’t offer.”

Fighting E-Commerce

The steady growth among Boston’s internet-resistant retail categories has been a defining point of this cycle. Boutique fitness concepts that focus on specific workout routines, as well as quick-service restaurants that offer healthy menu options, are among the new users beefing up their footprints in the state capital.

“We’re seeing many e-commerce brands realize that having a physical presence is important to building their brand and forming a better connection to their customers,” says Bialow. “This has helped backfill many of the voids created by traditional brick-and-mortar retailers closing their stores, though the city of Boston has fared much better than the suburbs in terms of [minimizing] closures.”

Companies that built their brands with e-commerce are also drawn to brick-and-mortar locations in Boston due to the metro’s demographic advantages, including a growing cohort of millennials. According to a recent report by the Boston Chamber of Commerce, more than a third of the city’s population was classified as millennials, persons roughly between the ages of 20 and 34.

And with more than 30 colleges and universities located throughout the Boston metro area, the market has a high proportion of millennials that have college degrees — almost 60 percent, according to recent data. These demographic traits make Boston an appealing market for companies seeking young talent, which in turn is drawn to workplace settings with strong retail and restaurant amenities.

Kenneth Fries, vice president of leasing, development and acquisitions at Needham, Mass.-based RK Centers, also cites grocery-anchored product as one of the market’s strongest-performing sectors. Established grocers like Wegmans, Whole Foods Market and Market Basket are among the users that have expanded their store counts during this cycle, unlocking additional value in the underlying real estate in the process.

“The draw of legacy grocers allows developers to charge rents that are higher than current market rates for ancillary, small-shop spaces,” says Fries. “But for smaller grocers that are faced with operating stores with declining sales, it often makes more sense to work with the landlord to permit and redevelop the land for a high-density residential use.”

While some small-shop spaces in more affluent neighborhoods command above-market rents, there is a shortage of affordable small-shop space across the market as a whole. According to Fries, this is one of the biggest concerns currently facing the Boston retail market, as it creates a major barrier to entry for up-and-coming retail concepts that lack the credit or capital to take space in a prime Boston location.

“The lack of availability of affordable small-shop space for budding new retail concepts is a problem,” says Fries. “It’s not a new problem, but in the past it always seemed like there were incubator locations for cool new tenants.”

In addition to hurting merchandisers, the dearth of quality retail space that won’t break the bank is also problematic for new restaurant users. These users, if not backed by a larger operating group, often have higher costs of occupancy — mainly in the form of tenant improvements — and take longer to turn a profit.

The market is experiencing ample demand for space from both nationally branded and chef-driven concepts. But restaurants that want to develop their own spaces face high construction costs and property taxes, and some users that are looking for turnkey spaces are being priced out by the market’s strong pace of rent growth.

The suburban markets of Eastern Massachusetts are also seeing absorption from certain national tenants, some of which have backfilled big box vacancies. According to a report from KeyPoint Partners, a full-service firm with offices throughout the region, Hobby Lobby led the way in terms of large-format store openings, recently adding two new locations in Braintree and Attleboro. Target has opened three new stores in Burlington, Medford and Cambridge; and At Home is opening a second regional store in Dedham.

Smaller-format retailers that have also boosted their presence in metro Boston include Xfinity (nine new stores), Verizon Wireless (seven new stores) and Richfield Convenience Express (seven new stores). According to KeyPoint Partners, this activity has brought the vacancy rate for all of Eastern Massachusetts, which has a market inventory of about 196 million square feet, to 9.4 percent.

Investment Outlook

Similar to retailers adjusting their sales and marketing strategies to adapt to e-commerce, landlords are retooling their tenant rosters to promote cross-shopping, longer visit times and socialization and recreation within their centers.

Retail investors are already drawn to Boston’s demographic and economic fundamentals. As retailers and developers continue to make the aforementioned changes, the confidence of retail investors in the operating strategies of these groups is coming back. This is perhaps best captured by a slight uptick in recent investment activity from institutional capital sources, the activity of which has largely been confined to shedding non-core assets over the last several years.

Based on property and portfolio sales of $2.5 million and above, private investors accounted for about 47 percent of all retail acquisitions in the Boston market during the first quarter of 2019 on a trailing 12-month basis, according to Real Capital Analytics (RCA) and CoStar Group. Publicly traded REITs comprised just 3.7 percent of buying activity, while equity funds and other sources of institutional capital accounted for 12 percent of purchases.

“Having in-house operating, development and leasing resources allows us to get granular in our valuation,” says Shelley Anderson, managing director at KPR Centers. “Being able to cite key tenant relationships in the underwriting and due diligence phases gives confidence in a successful transaction.”

Investors in Boston and beyond still face hurdles, however, such as accurately analyzing online sales data to determine a store’s overall health or finding value-add opportunities that aren’t overly capital-intensive. But according to Anderson, capital sources are still allocating funds for retail deals. Combined with Boston’s strong retail fundamentals — population growth, residential development and traffic counts — this mandate has elevated the competition among buyers in the marketplace.

“Competition continues to be tight within the [State Route] 128 and [Interstate] 495 rings, where demographics are especially robust,” says Anderson. “However, redevelopment costs incurred and rent adjustments are causing a shift in how we underwrite and evaluate risk for retail investments.”

Landlords are also being aggressive when it comes to pursuing tenant renewals and extensions, she adds. “As landlords seek to fill vacancies and fight for the new and thriving tenants, maintaining lease term and strong co-tenancy will distinguish winners from losers on residual sales of assets.”

The influx of millennials and high-paying jobs aside, Boston’s retail investment market also benefits from high barriers to entry, says Bob Horvath, executive vice president at Horvath & Tremblay, which specializes in net-lease and multi-tenant retail deals.

“Boston is still a desirable market for investors due to the complexity of zoning in New England, which serves as a barrier to entry for new development,” he says. “In addition, cap rates in this area tend to hold fairly steady relative to other parts of the country. The capital flow is sticky and tends to stay in New England, as local investors tend to focus on local assets.”

According to CoStar and RCA, as of the first quarter of 2019, the average cap rate for multi-tenant retail assets in the Boston area was about 6.5 percent. Single-tenant properties tended to trade at an average cap rate of 7.3 percent. The average sales prices for these asset classes clocked in at $322 per square foot and $374 per square foot, respectively.

Across the board, however, investors are paying close attention to the term and credit of tenants, as well as the residual risk component — whether the rent is replaceable with a new tenant or if it’s significantly above or below the market rate.

“The market on a national level is a little softer in terms of cap rates, and there’s been some upward movement on certain assets,” says Horvath. “But much of that is driven by macroeconomic factors — interest rates, uncertainty in the larger economy. This is still a top market with excellent fundamentals: population, income, traffic counts — all the things you look for in retail, Boston has them.”

https://www.wbur.org/news/2019/07/30/boston-heat-july-forecast-recap,['Boston'],Boston Sweats Through Its Hottest July On Record,"Tuesday brought more 90-degree weather to Boston, for the second official heat wave this summer — with warm temps on the way again Wednesday.

Many cities and towns in New England have had more 90-degree days than Boston. For instance: Windsor Locks, in Connecticut, has had 18 such days this month, the most there in any month on record. Most climate sites are experiencing one of — if not the — warmest Julys on record. It doesn’t matter which climate site you review, this is a top 10 warm month pretty much everywhere in the Northeast:

Many climate sites are experiencing a top-5 warm month this year. (Screenshot courtesy of the Southeast Regional Climate Center)

When you hear ""warmest July,"" what meteorologists mean is that the average between the day and the night ends up higher than any other month. Records for Boston go back to 1872, so when you have the warmest July on record it's significant.

Statistics can be funny because you can look at a variable all sorts of ways. For example, while this month will end up as Boston's warmest average July on record, it will be slightly off from warmest daily high temperatures — likely the third-warmest. And the number of 90-degree days will not exceed the record, which was 15 back in 1994:

As of Monday, there were 10 days at 90 or above this July. (Screenshot courtesy of NOAA)

The nights have been incredibly warm. Part of the reason the nights have been so tropical is due to something called the urban heat island effect. This keeps cities like Boston warmer than the surrounding countryside. All the concrete and other building materials radiate the heat absorbed during the day and keep cities warmer at night. Both daytime and nighttime temperatures have been on the rise over the past several decades, but the nights have been outpacing the rate of change, partially because of all the building that's going on in Boston.

This is true for any urban environment. Scientists agree the changing climate is due mostly to human influence from things like CO2, but the urban heat island effect has a part, as does natural variability, just not as much.

July has had humidity, but not excessively higher-than-average. I put together a chart that shows the number of hours we've spent at different dew point levels. The green box indicates the most humid hours. Notice there's been more hours than average with the highest (70 and over) dew points.

The number of hours with high dew points has been above average in July. (NOAA)

Earlier this month a few places actually had dew points nearing 80 degrees, which is about as high as you will ever see in the Northeast. Although this was extreme, it didn't last.

Not only is this July the warmest July on record, it's also the warmest month ever recorded here in Boston. Of course with temperatures around the globe rising, it shouldn't be any surprise we're seeing more and more monthly and yearly records for high temperatures. June was the warmest June for the entire globe and we've seen heat records broken from the United Kingdom down into Central Europe.

You perhaps heard about all the heat in Europe earlier this month. This included a record high of 38.7 degrees Celsius in England. That's over 101.6 degrees Fahrenheit. Incredible.

The Arctic continues to experience high rates of melting as well. If we look at the rate of summer melt since 2015, you will see that this year is lower than any of those years and on pace to perhaps break the record set back in 2012. All of this should be of no surprise to anyone. Global climate models have been predicting this warming for decades.

Since climatologists have been looking at the rate of warming for so long, we are now able to compare what's happening with what the models predict. A decade ago there was 10 years' less data; now with more data available, we can see the global climate models are doing a good job of predicting what we are observing.

Take a look at the chart below, which shows how actual temperatures have been, compared with computer models' predictions. The lines aren't going to be perfect, nor would we expect them to be. In the same way that the computer models I used to forecast today weather's aren't going to exactly predict what's going to happen, it's the same for climate models, but they are both pretty good at their respective jobs. Short-term models are good for forecasting weather within 10 days, the climate models are good at forecasting the climate years in advance.

Future months may or may not break records, but that doesn't mean that the climate isn't warming. There is no doubt that warmer records are going to outpace cooler ones in the coming years and we should expect more summer heat that lasts long and is more intense. We may start even getting used to an additional 90-degree day, or two or three, but in the coming decades the numbers of heat waves and tropical nights are likely to be on the rise and in an increasingly big way.",[]
https://www.kuow.org/stories/mmiw-in-seattle-tears-flow-as-city-commits-to-supporting-native-americans-93df,['Seattle'],Tears flow as Seattle Council commits to supporting Native Americans,"“Reclaiming the inherent responsibility of the City to protect its most vulnerable populations.”

Those are the first words in a resolution passed by the Seattle City Council on Monday that aims to support Native American communities — especially the crisis involving missing or murdered indigenous women and girls.

Councilmember Debora Juarez, a member of the Blackfeet Nation, listed what’s in the measure:

“Number one, we decolonize the data by improving data collection and reporting methods. We will be working with Chief Best, Mayor Durkan, City Attorney Pete Holmes, and King County Prosecutor Dan Satterberg.”

Juarez said the work is urgent.

“Seattle ranks No. 1 as having the highest rate of missing, murdered indigenous women and girls across this country,” she said.",[]
https://crosscut.com/2019/08/council-promises-seattle-its-own-green-new-deal,['Seattle'],Council promises Seattle its own Green New Deal,"Advocates of the plan have been speculating about what a Green New Deal might look like in Seattle while emphasizing the value of community input, especially from disadvantaged and vulnerable populations. In the end, the resolution that passed is mostly in line with the goals pushed forth by environmental group Seattle for a Green New Deal, which is run largely by Got Green and 350 Seattle.

Councilmember Kshama Sawant called the resolution “necessarily ambitious,” referring to its goal to dramatically push Seattle forward in its climate and equity initiatives.

“This is a very strong resolution with which to base our future fight on,” Sawant said. “There’s no other way to achieve this.”

The resolution, which was finalized hours before the council meeting, is inspired by the Green New Deal introduced by progressive leaders in Congress earlier this year. While that resolution has stalled, some municipalities, including New York and Los Angeles, have moved forward with their own versions. The resolution that the Seattle City Council passed details a broad range of green initiatives, including the promotion of free public transportation, elimination of carbon pollutants and adoption of renewables. The council first showed support of a resolution in June when advocates asked council members to sign a pledge committing to a citywide Green New Deal.

Lavanya Madhusudan, assistant to Councilmember Mike O’Brien, said while the resolution is nonbinding, it does set the stage for future action in the city.

“The resolution is the first step,” Madhusudan said by email before the vote. “By laying out a vision for what we are working towards, it sets the stage for future legislation to act to make this vision a reality.”

The resolution states that while the city has made some steps towards the goals listed within it, “that progress is insufficient to make the necessary changes to shift Seattle’s economy to be more equitable and ecologically sustainable.” The resolution suggests that financing of these actions be taken with “progressive revenue sources” and public funds.

While Seattle’s Green New Deal mentions carbon-cutting efforts the city already is pursuing, it calls for them to be pushed further. Mayor Jenny Durkan’s 2018 Climate Action Strategy aims for carbon neutrality by 2050, for example, while the resolution seeks to create a new goal of carbon neutrality by 2030. Madhusudan says that by expediting these actions, the resolution wants “to create action to redouble our efforts to meet the urgency of the climate crisis.”

Initially, advocates of Seattle’s Green New Deal were interested in creating an ordinance that would have been proposed alongside this resolution in order to ensure follow-up action. While no concurrent ordinance was proposed, Madhusudan says that it has been discussed in committee, and an ordinance to create a Green New Deal Oversight Board will be reviewed and revised over the next few weeks. At this point, she expects that it will be brought to a vote in early September.

For now, advocates say that the resolution is a solid beginning. King County Councilmember Larry Gossett, who spoke during the city council’s public comment period, also expressed an interest in introducing a Green New Deal resolution at the county level: “It’ll be a great foundation for me to pick it up and spread it.”

The resolution comes as Seattle is on the brink of electing a new council. After the general election in November, at least four council seats will have new occupants. O’Brien, who has worked with advocates to bring the resolution to council for weeks and is lead sponsor of the resolution, will not be returning. He encouraged new council members to push the Green New Deal and address the global climate crisis in his absence.

“A resolution alone is not going to solve it,” O’Brien said. “We have a lot of work to do going forward.”",[]
https://insideclimatenews.org/news/13082019/seattle-city-green-new-deal-heating-oil-tax-free-public-transit-congestion-pricing-resolution,['Seattle'],What Would a City-Level Green New Deal Look Like? Seattle's About to Find Out,"City leaders launched Seattle on the path to a Green New Deal this week, passing a resolution that starts laying out an ambitious plan for how the city can cut its greenhouse gas emissions in ways that protect the climate and improve the lives of its residents.

It's a nonbinding resolution, and like the national Green New Deal manifesto that's being promoted by Democrats in Congress, presidential hopefuls and the young activists in the Sunrise Movement, it's still mostly aspirational.

But it begins to sketch out a roadmap for Seattle's future as the city tries to both adapt to climate change and cut emissions in line with what the world's scientists say is needed.

The resolution envisions free public transit, a limit on new fossil fuel construction, 100 percent electric vehicles for ride sharing, and an infrastructure plan that takes sea level rise into account, among other ideas.

The big question confronting city officials and environmentalists now is how to begin implementing—and paying for—many of these initiatives. There are hints within the resolution, which mentions a congestion pricing plan to support low-income transit, using proceeds from a soda tax to promote healthy foods, and developing ""green zones"" to provide financing in neighborhoods that have historically borne the brunt of pollution.

Some climate activists see Seattle's measure as the first step toward moving from symbolic gestures to specific goals and potential ways to implement them.

""It lays out the goals and timeline and ways to get there,"" said Alec Connon, an organizer with the environmental advocacy group 350 Seattle. ""No policies have changed, but it is a clear statement of intent from Seattle leaders that they're understanding the sheer severity and urgency of the climate emergency.""

The move by Seattle highlights how local and state governments are setting ambitious targets to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions in the absence of federal action, particularly at a time when scientific warnings are becoming increasingly urgent and the Trump administration is backing out of federal efforts aimed at curbing climate change.

This spring, Washington became the fifth state or territory—following Hawaii, California, New Mexico and Puerto Rico—to pass legislation committing to 100 percent clean electricity by 2045. Other states, including New York, have adopted aggressive policies to meet goals set by the Paris climate agreement, which the Trump administration abandoned in 2017.

""Climate change is one of the gravest threats we face, and the solutions to climate change must also be solutions that address income inequality and racial inequity,"" Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan said in a statement after the City Council unanimously passed the resolution Monday. ""While they debate the Green New Deal in the other Washington, we must continue to do more in Seattle.""

Translating Goals Into Policy

While a nonbinding resolution can set out goals, the city will have to find ways to translate those goals into actual policy to make a difference.

""The bigger story is, 'Does Seattle take that next step?' Whether that's developing a tax or finding ways to earmark funding and go deeper into the implementation process,"" said Barry Rabe, a professor of public policy at the University of Michigan and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.

When asked if the city of Seattle had any specific plans on how it would fund the goals in the resolution, Jessica Finn Coven, the city's director of the Office of Sustainability and Environment said, ""the answer is yes and no.""

Last week, Durkan proposed a tax on home heating oil to help as many as 18,000 Seattle homes transition from oil to some form of cleaner energy. So, when it comes to funding the specific goal of transitioning away from using oil to heat homes, there is a specific mechanism on the table, Finn Coven said.

For the broader proposals in the resolution, she said, city lawmakers are researching their options and working with constituents and community leaders to determine how to move forward.

""Climate change is one of the gravest threats we face and the solutions to climate change must also be solutions that address income inequality and racial inequity,” Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan said. ""While they debate the Green New Deal in the other Washington, we must continue to do more in Seattle.”

Connon said he hopes to see policies soon now that the resolution has passed, and he believes there are promising funding options available to help the city pay for some of the initiatives laid out in the measure, such as congestion pricing and implementing new taxes.

As an example of one viable option used in another city, Connon points to a move by Portland, Oregon, where voters last November passed a measure that imposes a tax on large retailers to help pay for the city's clean energy efforts.

Another way Seattle could pay for its green goals would be a levy, Connon said. Earlier this spring, nearly 70 percent of Seattle voters backed a $2.2 billion education levy.

""There's no reason the city couldn't do a Green New Deal levy to help kick this off,"" he said.

'Cities Continue to Push the Needle'

Seattle is one of a handful of U.S. cities that have mitigation goals for urban heat islands, have adopted or advocated for stringent building energy codes and have set targets for energy efficient transportation plans that take into mind low-income communities, according to a report released last month by the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy (ACEEE).

When it comes to reducing energy use and trying to spur renewable energy, ""cities continue to push the needle,"" said David Ribeiro, senior research manager at ACEEE.

The ACEEE report found that 75 large U.S. cities had taken more than 200 actions on renewable energy and energy efficiency. Seattle ranked No. 3 in the report, behind San Francisco and Boston.

""In the case of Seattle, they are a city that's already leading on clean energy,"" Ribeiro said. ""They have aggressive goals; they have aggressive policies; they have good planning processes.""

Ribeiro said it's hard to know whether Seattle's Green New Deal resolution will push more cities to follow suit. Los Angeles recently released a ""Green New Deal"" sustainability plan focused heavily on energy efficiency and renewable energy.

""I think it's all a matter of the interest of the residents and business owners in that city,"" Ribeiro said.

https://www.geekwire.com/2019/city-council-members-join-public-scooter-test-rides-seattle-looks-add-transportation-option/,['Seattle'],City Council members join public in scooter test rides as Seattle looks to add transportation option,"Seattle City Councilmember Mike O’Brien said he has been a bicycle commuter for 20 years. On the plaza on Thursday in front of City Hall, O’Brien showed up carrying his own helmet, as he surveyed the scene where Lime and Bird electric scooters were lined up for a test-ride opportunity for members of the Council and public.

“When the whole scooter thing started a year or so ago, I kinda shrugged,” O’Brien said, figuring it wasn’t going to change his life. “And then I tried one. It was amazing, within about 30 seconds, how I felt comfortable on it and I could see how so many people who may not be comfortable on bikes for whatever reason could really adapt to using this.”

That seemed to be the prevailing sentiment under the hot noontime sun as dozens of people lined up to get a quick tutorial from Lime and Bird reps, strap on a helmet and then zip round the plaza.

The push by the transportation sharing companies comes a day after Seattle officials announced that they were speeding ahead with plans to launch a free-floating scooter share pilot program in the city. In a guest post on GeekWire on Wednesday, Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan said, “Let’s try scooters in Seattle. But let’s do it right.”

For members of the Council in agreement with the mayor, that means paying attention to and getting reassurances about everything from rider safety to sidewalk clutter.

“As a City Councilmember I’m excited to do everything the Council can to make this mobility option available to folks as soon as possible,” O’Brien said.

A new era in Seattle transportation? Councilmember Abel Pacheco celebrates his birthday with a festive Lime scooter ride at City Hall. pic.twitter.com/X7sV1rvJQM — GeekWire (@geekwire) May 9, 2019

Councilmember Abel Pacheco not only came to work on his birthday, but he rode a scooter decorated with colorful balloons for the occasion.

Councilmember Lorena González took off from one side of the plaza to the other and her giddy laughter could be heard as she sped away. She addressed the rise in injuries in cities where scooters have already arrived.

“I think we have a really strong culture in Seattle of people who ride bikes already, so I have often times seen people just traveling with their bike helmet,” González said. “It’s going to be an education process for us to make sure people understand how to safely use both bikes and scooters as they continue to be deployed throughout the city of Seattle. I think people in Seattle are very smart and very educated and they’re going to understand their own limitations and what they need to do to protect themselves.”

Glen Buhlmann used to work for Microsoft, and he gave up his car when he moved into Seattle from the Eastside. On the back of his left leg, he was sporting a tattoo of a person on a bicycle dumping a small car into a recycling bin.

“I have memberships with everything … bike shares, all three of the car shares, and I already had the Bird membership waiting for them to come,” Buhlmann said, adding that he thinks people were ready for a scooter program in Seattle a year ago. He said he believes the only valid criticism of bike and scooter-share programs is that the city doesn’t build enough safe places to use and park them.

Buhlmann figures he would mix scooters into his current transportation routine — “I’ll just use whatever’s closest,” he said. And when it comes to helmets, he doesn’t use them — “I’m not against helmets, I’m against helmet laws.”

Anna Zivarts is the program director of Rooted in Rights, a video advocacy program that is part of Disability Rights Washington.

“We haven’t seen the city figure it out yet with bike share,” Zivarts said about the prospect of scooters getting in the way of those who face challenges with accessibility. “We’re excited about the health benefits, the mobility benefits. It’s great that scooters are coming, we wan’t people to get out of cars and have more options. But we’ve got to figure out the parking.”

Zivarts, who was currently working on a video with the Seattle Department of Transportation on proper bike-share parking, said it’s not fair to ask the disability community, people whose mobility is already challenged, to bear the brunt of mis-parked bikes and scooters.

“Off-sidewalk parking would be great,” Zivarts said. “We have streets, we can decide how we allocate that space. Let’s allocate some of the parking space that goes to cars right now to bike shares and scooters.”

After some Council members took their test rides they returned to City Hall for a Sustainability and Transportation Committee lunch-and-learn session in which Portland-area officials presented findings from that city’s scooter pilot program.

The report sheds a lot of light on how scooters were received and used by the public in 2018 and what issues have raised concerns, including a lot of what Seattle hopes to address before even getting started such as safe spaces to ride, dedicated parking and equitable access.

Tyler VanBrocklin is studying informatics at the University of Washington and he’s an avid rider of LimeBikes as well as the company’s LimePod car sharing. He first rode scooters during a trip to Los Angeles with friends a couple months ago and the things were everywhere in Venice Beach.

He still has his own car but has slowly stopped using it.

“You don’t really need a car in a city like this that now has so many different options,” VanBrocklin said.

Daniel Babadzhanob is working on his own healthcare startup and he was one of the first on the scene at City Hall as Lime and Bird workers were setting up the scooters. He previously tried Lime scooters in Washington, D.C., when he was there for a conference.

“There were these scooters around and my friend and I decided to use it and try it out for the day,” he said. “We had just an unbelievable time. Just super awesome.”

His advice for the Council?

“Do it for sure,” Babadzhanob said. “It just offers another option for people to get to work and get to places and brings a new experience to Seattle.”

Councilmember O’Brien is among those who are listening.

“In a world where we have a lot of congestion, we have air pollution, these are the types of solutions we need and we need to do it right,” O’Brien said, adding that, in the case of bike sharing, “Seattle often is one of the first cities to do things when it comes to transportation.

“At the moment we’re one of the last, but that’s OK. We’ve learned from a lot of other cities. We can design a program that hopefully will be the best in the nation.”",[]
https://www.geekwire.com/2019/uber-lyft-drivers-roll-seattle-city-hall-demand-better-wages-worker-protections/,['Seattle'],Uber and Lyft drivers roll up to Seattle City Hall to demand better wages and worker protections,"A caravan of Uber and Lyft drivers arrived at the steps of Seattle City Hall on Thursday afternoon to demand better wages and treatment from the ride-hailing companies.

The rolling demonstration comes three weeks after drivers around the world held protests timed with Uber’s initial public offering. In both cases, the drivers involved said they are frustrated by the companies’ take rates and opaque methods of calculating rates. The drivers are also asking for a fair process to appeal deactivations on the apps.

It also comes on the same day Uber posted its first quarterly earnings report as a public company, revealing revenue of $3.1 billion and losses of $1 billion for the first quarter of 2019.

Huge caravans of Uber drivers are rallying around Capitol Hill. Maybe you hear them honking? pic.twitter.com/S3jtJgtJgl — nathalie graham (@gramsofgnats) May 30, 2019

But not all drivers are fed up with Uber and Lyft. Some claim that the protesters are just a vocal minority advocating on behalf of the incumbent taxi industry and stymieing innovation. This conflict is playing out in cities everywhere as drivers and lawmakers struggle to define this new form of work enabled by apps. But the struggle is especially acute in Seattle, the first city to pass a law that would allow Uber drivers to unionize if it ever makes it out of lawsuits delaying its implementation.

In some ways, drivers are on the frontlines of a proxy war between Uber and Teamsters 117, a union in Washington state representing warehouse workers, truck drivers, taxi drivers, and others. The Teamsters were involved in the crafting of Seattle’s collective bargaining ordinance. Teamsters affiliate the App-Based Drivers Association organized the caravan protest Thursday.

In Uber’s court is Drive Forward, a group of drivers organized by the company. Drive Forward Director Matthew Wald said the protesters are “the same small group of disgruntled former taxi drivers who have fought against rideshare in Seattle for years,” in a statement.

“The fact is that drivers do make a living wage and enjoy the freedom and flexibility to make money on their own terms as independent business owners,” Wald said. “The claims made by the App-Based Drivers Association are misleading and don’t represent the views of the vast majority of rideshare drivers.”

The driver caravan started in Seattle’s Central District and ended at City Hall, where they delivered a set of demands to city officials and a report that found Uber and Lyft have a median take rate of 31 percent in Seattle, based on their analysis of 560 trips. That’s up from Uber and Lyft’s take rate in previous years. Drive Forward disputes the findings of the report.

The drivers were greeted by Seattle City Councilmembers Teresa Mosqueda, Kshama Sawant, Lisa Herbold, and Mike O’Brien outside City Hall.

The hardline stance was approved by city legislators who also took the opportunity to place wider restrictions on the purchase of any new forms of surveillance technology – which must now be approved in advance.

A counter-reaction against the adoption of the technology arose amid fears that current techniques were both unreliable and unacceptable infringement on individual liberty and privacy, outweighing concerns that the move could undermine the fight against crime – even though San Francisco police do not currently employ facial recognition tools.

Emboldened by this success civil liberties campaigners have called for other cities to follow suit but others believe the issue is not as black and white as portrayed.

Joel Engardio, vice-president of Stop Crime SF, said: “Instead of an outright ban, we believe a moratorium would have been more appropriate.

""We agree there are problems with facial recognition ID technology and it should not be used today. But the technology will improve and it could be a useful tool for public safety when used responsibly. We should keep the door open for that possibility.""

Despite its best efforts, San Francisco will still be home to a minimal form of automated recognition although this will be restricted to air and sea ports which fall under the remit of the national government.

https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/8/18535627/uber-lyft-sf-traffic-congestion-increase-study,['San Francisco'],"Uber and Lyft are the ‘biggest contributors’ to San Francisco’s traffic congestion, study says","Uber and Lyft have long argued that ride-hailing apps have the potential to make cities better by ameliorating traffic and reducing personal car ownership. But there is a growing body of research that suggests the opposite is taking place. The latest study, published Wednesday in the journal Science Advances, underscores how Uber and Lyft are worsening traffic in the city that gave birth to the ride-sharing phenomenon.

San Francisco, home base to both Uber and Lyft, is experiencing some of its worst traffic in years — research firm INRIX ranks it the eighth most congested city in the US — and much of it is due to the rising popularity of transportation network companies (TNC, an industry term used to describe ride-hailing apps like Uber and Lyft). How bad is it? According to today’s study, between 2010 and 2016 traffic congestion in San Francisco increased by about 60 percent — and Uber and Lyft are responsible for more than half of that increase.

Uber and Lyft are responsible for more than half of the increase in vehicle delays

The study began when the San Francisco County Transportation Authority (SFCTA) reached out to Gregory Erhardt, associate professor for civil engineering at the University of Kentucky and an expert in transportation models and travel forecasting, to help determine the impact of ride-sharing on the city’s traffic patterns. (The authority previewed the findings of the study in its own report released in October last year.)

Erhardt said the goal was to present a “before” and “after” picture of San Francisco’s streets — before Uber and Lyft became popular in 2010, and after they became a dominate mode of transportation in 2016. To start out, they used a standard transportation simulation to control for variables, such as population growth, changes to the city’s transportation system, and a rise in freight and deliveries.

A big challenge going into this project was access to data. Uber and Lyft are sitting on troves of really interesting data on the movement of cars and people, but they are generally reluctant to share it with governments or academic researchers out of privacy concerns and for fear of compromising their competitive advantage. As a result, the research into the effect on congestion has been a mixed bag: some studies conclude that TNCs reduce congestion, while others note they increase vehicle miles traveled (VMT). Still others fail to reach any conclusion at all — and most researchers cite the lack of data as a prime obstacle.

Erhardt and Joe Castiglione, the deputy director for technology, data, and analysis at SFCTA, reached out to some data scientists at Northeastern University who had put together a computer program that queries the API (application programing interface) for both Uber and Lyft, and reports the location of the 10 closest vehicles in both apps.

“And what they were able to do is set up sort of a grid of client calls to the API across San Francisco for a six month period in late 2016,” Erhardt told The Verge. “Every two seconds, they say, ‘Hey, where are the 10 closest vehicles, write that to a database. And we ended up with about 17 terabytes worth of data. But what you get out of it are these traces of where the vehicles are, where the drivers are, and when they’re available for a ride.”

Erhardt’s team used a panel regression model to determine the change in travel time during this period, and what they found surprised them: far from alleviating traffic, Uber and Lyft are actually the “biggest contributor[s]” to San Francisco’s worsening traffic congestion.

Specifically, they found that the difference in travel times in congested conditions versus travel times in a free-flowing scenario — which they characterize as “vehicle hours of delay” — increased by 62 percent. Average speeds in San Francisco decreased by 13 percent in the time period. By contrast, in a simulated model that removes Uber and Lyft from the equation, weekday vehicle hours of delay increased by only 22 percent and average speeds decreased by 4 percent in the city.

“There has been this narrative about how [Uber and Lyft] have the potential to support transit, bringing people to and from transit stations, they have a potential to enable carpooling, and they have some potential to reduce people’s auto ownership,” Erhardt told The Verge. “And those things are true to a degree. But the question is whether they’re true enough to offset the ways in which TNCs increased congestion. And we find that when you look at the data, that’s not the case.”

Erhardt’s team isn’t the first to look at the effect Uber and Lyft have had on traffic in big cities. Probably the most widely cited study was done by Bruce Schaller, a transit consultant who served as deputy commissioner for traffic and planning in New York City. Last summer, he released a report called “The New Automobility,” in which he concluded that ride-hail companies like Uber and Lyft have added 5.7 billion miles of driving annually in cities like Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami, New York, Philadelphia, San Francisco, Seattle, and Washington, DC.

Erhardt said his research differs from Schaller’s in so far as it “zoomed in” on a specific city during a specific period time, and examined the effect of Uber and Lyft on traffic congestion. “To be able to look at this in two different ways, and find similar results, is really important and really encouraging,” he added.

Last week, the Sierra Club launched an ad campaign urging Uber and Lyft to curb air pollution by switching to fully electric cars. The environmental group is hoping to leverage Uber’s impending IPO to highlight the ride-hail companies’ contribution to climate change and rising carbon emissions.

To be sure, Uber and Lyft have weathered criticism about pollution and traffic congestion for years. And the company has tried to address it through a variety of means, including its bike- and scooter-sharing services, its effort to integrate public transportation scheduling and ticketing into its app, and its incentive program to get drivers to switch to electric cars. Uber also supported New York City’s recent push for congestion pricing.

spokespersons for both Uber and Lyft sent similar-sounding statements

Asked for a comment on the study, spokespersons for both Uber and Lyft sent similar-sounding statements touting their support for “comprehensive congestion pricing,” improved bike and scooter infrastructure, carpooling, and support for public transportation. They also both tried to cast doubt on the study’s findings. Uber said that “studies disagree on causes for congestion,” while Lyft notes that Erhardt’s study “overlooks notable contributors to congestion including increased freight and commercial deliveries, and tourism growth.”

Erhardt said he hopes his study will serve as a wake-up call to city planners, who have the power to enact change that can help reduce the congestion. “If I’m riding in an Uber or Lyft, it’s pretty convenient, it’s reasonably cheap, I get door to door service,” he said. “However, there’s an externality, there’s an effect on other people on the road. Me being in a car, I’m causing congestion for other people. And the same thing happens if I’m driving my personal car as well. And so what city planners and city officials need to do is somehow balance that out, balance out the benefits of the person in the car, with the cost to everyone else.”",[]
https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2019/jul/01/san-francisco-big-tech-workers-industry,['San Francisco'],'We all suffer': why San Francisco techies hate the city they transformed,"San Franciscans have long complained that tech workers ruined their city, driving up rents and homelessness and eliminating diversity. Now even the tech workers agree

It was a beautiful winter day in San Francisco, and Zoe was grooving to the soundtrack of the roller-skating musical Xanadu as she rode an e-scooter to work. The 29-year-old tech worker had just passed the Uber building when, without warning, a homeless man jumped into the bike lane with his dog, blocking her path.

She slammed on the brakes, flew four feet into the air and landed on the pavement, bleeding. “It was one of those hardening moments where I was like, ‘Even I am being affected,’” she recalled.

It should be noted that Zoe, who asked not to be identified by her real name because she was not authorized by her employer to speak to the press, is not the stereotypical tech bro who moves to San Francisco for a job and immediately starts complaining about the city’s dire homelessness crisis. She arrived in 2007 to study at San Francisco State University and had a career in the arts before attending a coding bootcamp and landing a job at a major tech company.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Many gentrified neighborhoods are renamed, like the East Cut, pictured, formerly known by local residents as part of SoMa in downtown San Francisco.

But the fall and other incidents, including getting mugged and having her phone stolen, have all contributed to her growing sense of insecurity in the area. She told the Guardian the tale of her scoot, interrupted, because she said it was a perfect example of her own – and perhaps the broader community of tech workers’ – increasingly hate-hate relationship with San Francisco. “This guy needed services to help him,” she said of the man who caused her to fall, “and we all suffer because of the issues that are not being addressed.”

A quarter of a century after the first dot-com boom, the battle for San Francisco’s soul is over and the tech industry has won. But what happens when the victors realize they don’t particularly like the spoils?

Tech workers are increasingly vocal about their discontent with the city they fought so hard to conquer. In May, the median market rent for a one-bedroom apartment reached an all-time high of $3,700 a month, according to the rental site Zumper. Meanwhile, the city saw a 17% increase in its homeless population between 2017 and 2019, and residents complain of visible drug usage, fear of crime and dirty streets. Even Marc Benioff, CEO of Salesforce and a San Francisco native who has long urged comity between the techies and the city, has taken to calling his hometown a “train wreck”.

For Zoe, the newfound financial security from working in tech does not counterbalance a constant sense of being unsafe in the city. She now earns three to four times more than when she was a “starving artist”, but she says she is terrified to walk at night. She no longer rides scooters and says she feels “triggered” when she sees them around the city. She takes Ubers everywhere after dark and asks drivers to watch to make sure she gets inside her apartment building.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest A homeless man picks up a syringe on Mission Street. Median rent for a one-bedroom apartment in San Francisco reached $3,700 a month in May.

“Mark Zuckerberg lives nearby, but our corner is the main prostitution corner in the city,” she said of the Mission District apartment she shares with her boyfriend. “There’s condoms and syringes. It’s absolutely crazy with how much we pay for rent … It’s tough, because we work in tech, but we ask ourselves every day if we should move.”

It’s a striking contrast from just five years ago, when tech workers showed up in force at San Francisco City Hall to declare their love and respect for a city that was not exactly loving them back. “I am so proud to live in San Francisco and be a part of this community,” Google employees were instructed to say, as a preface to their remarks at a January 2014 hearing before the local transportation authority, according to a leaked company memo.

I feel like San Francisco is between Seattle and New York, but rather than the best of both, it’s the worst of both

That hearing was one of several pivotal moments in recent San Francisco history when public officials could have used the city’s legislative or regulatory powers to force the tech industry to contribute more to public services, but chose not to. Such inflection points (which also include a controversial 2011 tax break for Twitter and a failed attempt at a “tech tax” in 2016) highlight the complicated relationship between the city government and an industry that has brought untold wealth and jobs, but has arguably failed to pay its fair share – while treating the city as a petri dish for disruptive innovations (think Uber, Airbnb and self-driving cars) by ignoring regulations.

The nominal issue in 2014 was the use of public bus stops by private charter shuttles (AKA “Google buses”) hired by tech companies to ferry employees the 45 miles south to their Silicon Valley headquarters. Activists wanted the double-decker buses banned from the streets and the companies fined for the illegal use of bus stops; the city chose to legalize the buses.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest Workers near Google’s San Francisco offices catch a bus headed to Mountain View, home of the company’s main campus.

The Google Bus controversy was particularly charged because it tapped into local residents’ deep concern that San Francisco – a city with the population of Jacksonville, Florida, and the self-importance of New York – would be reduced to a bedroom community for Silicon Valley. But while the buses continue to ply their routes north and south, that particular nightmare scenario hasn’t come to pass. Instead, San Francisco has become more of a satellite campus, with South Bay stalwarts including Apple, Facebook, Google and LinkedIn competing for office space in the city proper. They’ve joined the San Francisco-native companies Twitter, Uber, and Airbnb in the cramped confines of a city of just 49 square miles, surrounded by water on three sides.

Sure, you get people from all over the world, but the only ones who can move here now come from the same socio-economic class

The consequences of that squeeze are well documented: the outrageous housing costs, the displacement of black and Latino families, evictions, homelessness, the loss of beloved businesses and cultural institutions. The tale of how tech destroyed the city that gave us the Summer of Love has been told so many times that in 2014, the San Francisco Chronicle produced a satirical cheat sheet for out-of-town reporters parachuting in for taste of avocado toast and class warfare. (Amid a bumper crop of new elegies to San Francisco in recent months, web publication HmmDaily updated the form with an “AI Algorithm-generated” version.)

But what’s striking about the current winter of our discontent (yes, it’s July; consider this your obligatory Mark Twain reference) is that it’s not just the archetypal “evicted Mission District visual artist” complaining that techies ruined San Francisco: it’s the techies themselves, too.

Facebook Twitter Pinterest A public space on the ground floor of the LinkedIn office.

The arguments against San Francisco are manifold: it’s too expensive even for people making six-figure salaries, it’s dangerous and depressingly unequal, and, increasingly, it’s kind of boring. A frequent refrain among the more than a dozen tech workers who spoke to the Guardian for this article was that it is not so much the presence of have-nots that is ruining their experience of San Francisco, but an overabundance of haves.

“The housing crisis has a huge negative impact on quality of life because of who it excludes from living near you,” said Simon Willison, a software developer who moved to San Francisco from London five years ago. “When I visit other cities I’m always jealous of their income diversity: that people who have jobs that don’t provide a six-digit salary can afford to live and work and be happy.”

There’s no future for anyone under 40 in this city who’s not rich

“Even though people think there is diversity in the city, there isn’t really,” said Adrianna Tan, a senior product manager at a tech startup who moved to San Francisco from Singapore. “Sure, you get people from all over the world, but the only ones who can move here now come from the same socio-economic class.”

“I feel like San Francisco is between Seattle and New York, but rather than the best of both, it’s the worst of both,” said Beth, a 24-year-old product manager who asked not to be identified by her real name. Beth moved to the city directly after graduating from Stanford to work at a major tech company, but recently transferred to Seattle. “Everyone I met was only interested in their jobs, and their jobs weren’t very interesting,” she said of her time in San Francisco. “I get it, you’re a developer for Uber, I’ve met a million of you.”

Facebook Twitter Pinterest A man holds a sign as people watch a Democratic candidate debate in the Mission District.

One aspect of that homogeneity is that when everyone around you is either rich or destitute, being rich doesn’t feel that rich.

“Unless you’re here to hit the IPO jackpot, you’ll always be middle-class,” said Chris, a former Apple manager who recently decided to leave San Francisco for Texas and spoke on condition of anonymity. “Tech salaries allow you to get by for now, but there’s no future for anyone under 40 in this city who’s not rich.”

Chris and his partner’s combined annual income places them comfortably in the top 1% of earners in the US – but not in San Francisco, which recently achieved the dubious distinction of having the most billionaires per capita in the world. He said that the “cost/benefit perspective” on San Francisco was no longer working for him.

“It’s just not sustainable for a couple to live here,” he said. “A million-plus for a home with $300,000 down? Then when we have kids, $30,000 a year for private school? Who can afford that even making $300,000 a year? … There’s hundreds of other places in the country with the same restaurant culture or at least on par that cost half as much.”

Chris also complained about the “property crime, unchecked homeless and drug issues” plaguing the city, noting that he had recently witnessed a man smoking crack cocaine in broad daylight in the middle of the famously twisty Lombard street. “You don’t see people smoking crack brazenly in public on Melrose in LA or in Times Square, NYC, but here the cops just shrug.”

Figuring out how to exist in a city with so much human misery clearly on display is another challenge for affluent tech workers, many of whom express compassion for the poor and homeless, as well as frustration with the city’s decades of failure in providing adequate shelter and services to the homeless and mentally ill.

“It was really hard to stomach the indifference that I witnessed from folks who’d been living in San Francisco for a while, simply stepping over the slumped bodies of people who lived outside or just cold ignoring people asking for money,” said Jessica Jin, who moved to San Francisco from Austin, Texas, to work for a tech startup, of her first impressions of the city. “I wondered how long it would take me to also become numb to it all.”

Badrul Farooqi, a startup worker, said that he had been surprised to experience echoes of the constant fear of crime and violence he was exposed to growing up in Detroit while living in San Francisco. “The entire purpose of going to school and working hard was to escape this kind of environment,” he said.

And while Farooqi acknowledged that San Francisco was much better off than the Detroit of his childhood, he argued that in some ways it was worse because the misery seems so unnecessary. “San Francisco is not Detroit,” he said. “Detroit was always poor … San Francisco has money! There’s so much money in this city.”

https://www.nbcbayarea.com/news/local/san-francisco-public-toilets-help-homeless-cost-200000/147930/,['San Francisco'],"San Francisco Public Toilets Help Homeless, Cost $200,000","The sidewalks surrounding Ahmed Al Barak’s corner market in one of San Francisco’s roughest neighborhoods are filled with cardboard, used syringes and homeless people who have nowhere safe to go at night.

But Al Barak says it’s an improvement from a year ago, before the city posted a portable toilet across the street from his business in the city’s Tenderloin district.

He no longer regularly sees people relieve themselves in broad daylight, and he doesn’t see as much feces and urine on the streets. In his opinion, it’s the one bright spot in a city where taxes are too high.

“We used to have a disaster here. I used to call the city all the time to come and clean, because they don’t know where to go,” he said, recalling one woman in particular who shrugged at him in a “what can you do?” gesture as she squatted to pee.

San Francisco started its “Pit Stop” program in July 2014 with public toilets in the city’s homeless-heavy Tenderloin, after children complained of dodging human waste on their way to school. Today, the staffed bathrooms have grown from three to 25 locations, and the program has expanded to Los Angeles. In May, the toilets in San Francisco recorded nearly 50,000 flushes, all logged by attendants.

The condition of San Francisco’s streets has been a source of embarrassment to city leaders, and cleaning up is not cheap. The city received nearly 27,000 requests for feces removal in the most recent fiscal year, although not all are human.

Mayor London Breed last year announced the formation of a special six-person “poop patrol” team where each cleaner earns more than $70,000 a year.

Advocates say steam cleaning requests have dropped in areas surrounding some of the public toilets. The mayor signed a budget Thursday that includes money for seven new Pit Stop bathrooms for a city where a one-night count of homeless people grew 17% in the past two years. The toilets each cost an average of $200,000 a year to operate, with most of the money going to staffing and overhead.

Some of the bathrooms are permanent fixtures, while others are portables with two toilets that are trucked in and out. The stops have receptacles for used syringes and dog waste. Attendants who are paid the city’s minimum wage of $16 an hour check after every use and knock on doors to make sure people are not doing drugs or other illicit activity. The bathrooms must shine or they do not open.

The staffing is what makes a toilet a Pit Stop, and the work is usually done by men coming out of prison after decades behind bars.

The “practitioners” stand guard at some of society’s bleakest intersections of poverty, addiction and mental illness, says Lena Miller, founder of nonprofit Hunters Point Family and its spinoff, Urban Alchemy, which staffs the Pit Stops in San Francisco and Los Angeles. They prevent overdoses, break up fights and greet regulars, she says.

“Really what we’re doing is we’re creating this space where people know that they can walk into it, and it’s going to smell good. It’s going to look good,” Miller said. “There won’t be trash everywhere, and they’re safe. And I think that makes all the difference in the world.”

Nelson Butler was a 19-year-old Los Angeles gangster when he went to prison for 30 years for killing a person. Butler was released last year from San Quentin State Prison, scared and apprehensive and in need of a job. He went to work at a Pit Stop.

Technically, his job was to prevent drug use in the bathrooms and make sure homeless people didn’t set up camp.

“The reality is I’m a security guard. I was a babysitter, I was a social worker, I was a counselor. I did a lot of things that was not necessarily in the scope of my job description, but this is my community,” Butler said. “So my thought was, if I saw somebody that needed help, that’s why I’m there — to help.”

Homelessness has surged throughout California, and cities are struggling to open more bathrooms. Officials are considering adding port-a-potties and special loos designed by the city of Portland, Oregon, and expanding hours of restrooms in government buildings.

Sacramento, which is in a county where a one-night count of the homeless increased 19% in two years, tried a Pit Stop but stopped after a few months because it cost too much.

Los Angeles Councilmember Mike Bonin initially thought the stops too pricey, but he now understands that having someone to watch over the bathrooms has its upsides. Los Angeles saw a 16% increase over a year in its one-night count of homeless, to 36,000.

“I heard from everyone, from people affiliated with law enforcement, from people who live in the neighborhood, from homeless advocates, from people who are homeless themselves, that it’s important to have a staff to make sure they stay clean and free of destruction or abuse,” he said.

Down the street from Ahmed Al Barak’s corner market is Aref Elgaali’s Z Zoul, a Sudanese cafe. The public bathroom by his eatery has helped, he says, but it closes too early, and there should be many more of the toilets.

“Why not to have in this corner one and that corner one and the other corner one? That will solve a lot of problems for the people here in San Francisco,” he said.",[]
https://xconomy.com/detroit-ann-arbor/2019/02/20/detroit-urban-solutions-seeks-to-amplify-the-regional-tech-ecosystem/,['Detroit'],Xconomy: Detroit Urban Solutions Seeks to Amplify the Regional Tech Ecosystem,"TechTown Detroit, Wayne State University, and NextEnergy have formed a new consortium to advance the Motor City’s tech ecosystem and apply new innovations to tough civic challenges.

Called Detroit Urban Solutions, the consortium will focus primarily on mobility, digital health, civic, and smart city technologies. We called Paul Riser Jr., who is stepping down from his position overseeing technology-based entrepreneurship at TechTown to lead Detroit Urban Solutions, to find out more.

“The collaboration builds upon previous research and work done years ago by the Brookings Institution on innovation districts,” Riser says. “We saw an opportunity to revisit the plan now that the climate has improved over the past five years.”

Detroit Urban Solutions will be located in the former NextEnergy headquarters on Burroughs Street, which Wayne State purchased last year for $6.6 million. (NextEnergy will keep its office and continue to run technology demonstrations there, but it no longer needed the whole building, says Jim Saber, the organization’s CEO.)

Ultimately, Riser says, Detroit Urban Solutions is meant to be a “living lab” that can serve as a physical location where innovators from across the region can connect and collaborate.

“Our work will involve assessing what’s already happening, what stakeholders are doing, and how that can be combined and leveraged,” Riser explains. “There are a lot of great efforts already underway, but they’re not as connected as they could be. We see it as an opportunity to bring those efforts together and uplift and amplify them with resources and cross-vertical connections.”

Riser says it’s imperative that Detroit Urban Solutions retains and elevates the voice of the community. “The way to solve problems is to get as close to them as possible,” he continues. “We’re intentional about staying close to the pulse and needs of the community—of everyday residents, not just those downtown.”

Riser says he envisions Detroit Urban Solutions doing a lot of matchmaking—between startup founders and funders, for example, or companies and potential customers—and catalyzing co-development opportunities, which he calls “bottom-up innovation.” Industry will be brought into the fold whenever appropriate, he adds, and the consortium’s work will also touch on access to education, training, and investment capital.

Riser says members of the private sector who want to get involved with Detroit Urban Solutions’ work should contact him for details. The consortium also plans to have a portal on its website in the future where members of the public can engage.

Riser compares the mission of Detroit Urban Solutions to programs such as UrbanX in New York City or the MetroLab network.

“The United States represents 40 percent of global urban technology investments—a lot of people underestimate urban tech because it’s a buzzword, but there’s a great level of investment and resources,” Riser says. “We’re emphasizing the regional collaboration approach. We want Detroit Urban Solutions to be a place for everyone to connect to reveal what we’re capable of.”

https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/2019/06/detroit-urban-beekeepers-transforming-city/,['Detroit'],Detroit’s urban beekeepers are transforming the city’s vacant lots,"Detroit natives Timothy Paule and Nicole Lindsey witnessed first-hand the negative effects the housing crisis had on their city. With roughly 90,000 vacant lots, neighborhoods have been destabilized and communities abandoned with little action being taken, in their view, to fix the root of the problem.

When Paule became sick one recent winter and developed a really bad cough that neither medicine, home remedies or a trip to the doctor could cure, he visited a local store where the owner introduced him to the benefits of raw honey. He explained to Paule that his supply came from a beekeeper. That led to an aha moment for Nicole Lindsey. “When that worked, it clicked, like, okay let’s study more about this honey and its medicinal properties,” she says. The couple developed an idea to transform some of Detroit’s vacant lots into urban bee farms. (Follow the hunt for psychotropic honey.)

Paule and Lindsey started Detroit Hives, a non-profit organization, in 2017 as a way to rebuild some of Detroit’s inner-city communities and spread bee awareness. They have successfully converted seven vacant lots into apiaries and currently maintain 34 beehives with plans to add ten more this year. And since most of the produce found in supermarkets—such as fruits, nuts and vegetables—are pollinated by bees, Tim and Nicole are also growing vast amounts of vegetables on their urban farms for their bees to cross pollinate—providing a solution to the food deserts that exist some cities.

“I didn’t know anything about bees, neither did she, so like, there was no ego involved, We both brought our mutual passion and knowledge together,” Paule says “It’s something we can do together. We built this together, we both have invested into this, we both have a lot of sweat equity put into this.” (Hear from those who are reimagining Detroit.)

As a power couple whose passion for bee keeping is making an impact on the city of Detroit, their reach extends beyond the parameters of their apiaries. “We partner with local schools, community organizations, as well as local businesses where they all can play a part in sustainability,” says Paule. “We host so many tours and field trips at our educational apiary. I think we hosted close to 300 tours.

[Children] get to put on a bee keeping suit and go hands-on into a hive. And this is right in their own community. They don’t have to travel two, three hours away.” (See what would happen if honeybees disappeared.)

The success of Detroit Hives caught the eye of documentary filmmaker Palmer Morse, who co-directed a film about the project with Rachel Weinberg. He says he was intrigued by the tangible change they were making in their community when he read about them in an online publication. When he saw them in another publication a week later, he decided to reach out.

“It’s not very often that you hear about someone, a couple, or anyone, who takes an idea that they have to make change in their community and actually takes it upon themselves to make it happen,” says Morse, co-founder of Spruce Tone Films.

“Spending time with Tim and Nicole just really kind of reminded me that there are still really good people who are making change and shedding positive light on something that’s seen often as negative,” Morse said.

Filming the documentary “Detroit Hives” hit close to home for Morse. “When I was in college my parents actually lost their home to foreclosure in Massachusetts and that was a really hard thing for my family to go through. Knowing that in Detroit there are so many homes that have also been victims of foreclosure, often for reasons beyond their control, just being in Detroit and seeing that really hit home for me.

“I kind of feel like I needed to make this film kind of for myself, and have a little bit of closure for what my family went through,” he said.

“Detroit Hives” premiered at Freep Film Festival in April 2019. Morse and Weinberg hope to make an impact beyond the film festival circuit. After gaining an understanding of how essential honey bees are to our ecosystem, they would like to with the couple and partner with more non-profit and education-based organizations to bring the film to classrooms.

“So I think it’s really important to find all these incredible people around the country and all over the world and give them a voice and a platform,” Weinberg says.

Lindsey is thrilled about being able to ease fears about bees.

“[I want to encourage] young girls to not be afraid of bees,” she says. “We get a lot of girls who come to the bee farm who are terrified. And I let them know, hey I was once afraid of bees. It wasn’t until I started learning about them that the fear transferred into love.” (Here are the strangest way humans have consumed honey throughout history.)

The couple has a goal to reach 200 beehives by 2020.

Paule and Lindsey want to make learning about bee conservation fun and engaging. From fraternity and sorority “bee houses” to plans to build a bee-themed art park, they are just getting started. They say they have become closer as a couple through it all.

“Being able to [see Nicole] reach her passion and she actually loves it, and it actually allowed her to get over some fears, [is] truly rewarding,” says Paule. “Whenever you start removing a lot of fears, it allows you to grow more as a person. [So this] allows us to grow individually, but also together.”",[]

The initial design phase, which will bring all parties together to create a formal plan, will take about 18 months, officials said.

The Agence Ter team suggested creating a sort of frame around the ten blocks containing a group of cultural institutions, including the DIA, Wayne State University, the Detroit Historical Society, the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History, the College For Creative Studies, the Michigan Science Center, and the Scarab Club.

Within that “Detroit Square,” the project will bring the inside out through “common ground” or communal backyards running between the buildings and their landscapes, to be activated with outdoor cafes, performance spaces, a mobile DJ booth, green spaces, public art, as well as live performance spaces for events. Woodward Avenue, which runs through this district, also may see its massive size reduced.

The selection not only inspires pride among the winning team, said akoaki’s Anya Sirota, but it shows how Detroit’s participating institutions and judges are willing to give “an open-ended framework” a chance to succeed.

For Sirota, that means the design will continue to evolve as the team works with local stakeholders, residents, and other parties to make the cultural center truly the heart of Midtown Detroit, one of the city’s most revitalized and vibrant neighborhoods.

“We took a risk to create a memorable design that was also suggestable,” Sirota said. “We felt strongly that we would need additional feedback on these ideas [and] we’re excited that the jury went with something that allowed for more conversation with stakeholders.”

The size and scope of the project are grand, Sirota added, and previous projects involving this area and around Detroit have gone forward without deep feedback, conversation, and consideration of the long-term effect on the city or its residents. This project seeks to “tread lightly” and be sensitive to placemaking within a city that is more than 300 years old and has concerns about issues like gentrification.

Sirota also said she is pleased that the plan the winning team is working on will take issues of mobility, environmental sustainability, and stormwater stewardship into consideration. Having a team made up of experts in physical technology, landscaping, urban planning, and design with a Detroit-centic base should provide many new ideas for the cultural center, she noted.

Midtown Detroit Inc. and DIA launched the design competition in 2017 to find a team that could unite twelve cultural and educational institutions with a kind of “town square” feel. The goal was to develop a “unified, dynamic, and inclusive space that facilitates connections throughout the Cultural Center,” DIA director Salvador Salort-Pons has said.

The Midtown Cultural Connections project had 44 initial submissions from more than 10 countries and 22 cities. Those were winnowed down to eight firms and then three finalists. The other finalists included TEN x TEN of Minneapolis and Mikyoung Kim Design of Boston.",[]

Under a deal Hantz Farms has struck with Mayor Mike Duggan, Hantz will swap the city 37 parcels on Beniteau Street that are needed for stormwater retention and parking at FCA's Mack Avenue engine plants, which the automaker plans to convert into a new assembly plant.

Hantz will pay the city and Detroit Land Bank Authority 8.33 cents per square foot for the 450 parcels under a price the company negotiated with former Mayor Dave Bing's administration in 2013 for 180 acres of land that was used to establish Hantz's urban nursery, said Basil Cherian, Duggan's deputy group executive for jobs and the economy.

""This agreement also allows us to finally complete Hantz Farms, a mile square project on the east side of Detroit we have been working on for seven and a half years,"" John Hantz, CEO of Southfield-based Hantz Group LLC, said Tuesday in a statement.

The Hantz deal is part of Duggan's larger effort to assemble 200 acres to subsidize FCA's $2.5 billion investment in automobile manufacturing around the Mack Avenue facilities and its Jefferson North Assembly Plant that's expected to create nearly 5,000 new jobs.

The mayor's office is trying to get quick approval on the land deal from City Council by April 23 ahead of FCA's April 26 deadline for the city to acquire the land it needs to finalize the Mack Avenue project.

Duggan also is asking City Council to approve a swap of 22 land-bank-owned and three city-owned parcels with DTE Energy Co. in exchange for 40 acres at the energy company's former Conner Creek power plant site between Jefferson and the Detroit River. That deal includes giving DTE the Public Lighting Department building on 3rd Street downtown, Cherian said.

DTE has said it plans to use the remainder of the parcels scattered throughout the city to build future substations and pullout yards for parking trucks and equipment.

Hantz Farms' land purchase amounts to about $150,000 for 370 vacant parcels and up to 80 homes that need to be rehabilitated, plus the unspecified value of 37 parcels that will be transfered to FCA, Cherian said.",[]
https://detroit.curbed.com/2019/7/29/8938044/detroit-urban-farming-animal-livestock-law,['Detroit'],Detroit’s farmers are losing patience with the city’s outdated livestock laws,"In March this year, Atieno Kasagam came home from a long vacation to find a slip for a misdemeanor complaint on the front door of her house. It cited her for possession of a farm animal without a permit and having an unlicensed dog.

It wasn’t the first time her and her partner Zomi Huron have gotten the fine, and it probably won’t be the last. The couple owns a produce farm, Ile Ibeji, spread across several lots in Jefferson Chalmers where they keep dozens of fowl—chickens, ducks, geese—and don’t plan on getting rid of any. It’s currently illegal to keep any “wild animals” inside the city limits, according to Detroit’s city code.

Kasagam was furious. She and Huron have been keeping animals for years and live on a block with lots of vacancies and only six neighbors, none of whom mind the animals. The law is largely enforced through a complaint-based system, so Kasagam suspects that an outsider spotted the animals and reported it.

Fines for violating the ordinance can be as much as $250 per animal. Despite being seven months pregnant with her second child, Kasagam wanted to protest the charge, which could have resulted in jail time. At her court appearance, the judge offered to dismiss the fines and charges if she paid $190 in court fees. She ultimately accepted the deal.

But she’s still desperate for the city to update the code. Kasagam says animals are an important part of the life-cycle of a farm—their manure reintroduces nutrients into the soil and the animals can be a source of food (milk, eggs, meat). Bees, which are in a legal gray area, pollinate plants.

“The practice of raising food and livestock at a scale that is healthy is about freedom and self-sufficiency,” Kasagam says. “And we should be allowed to do it.”

Kasagam isn’t the only farmer who wants the ordinance updated. Some have had their animals confiscated and almost every livestock owner keeps them secret. Kasagam says she knows “at least 50” farmers that keep livestock.

Animal Care and Control wasn’t able to provide numbers for how many livestock it confiscates and how many fines it issues by the time of publication.

Mark Covington, founder of Georgia Street Community Collective, a produce farm in northeast Detroit, isn’t so discreet. At any given time, he has between 40 to 60 fowl, but invites kids, volunteers, and other visitors to his farm almost every day. One of those visitors was Mayor Mike Duggan. He’s also been profiled several times by local and national outlets.

Covington says he keeps his place as clean and quiet as possible to prevent complaints. And similar to Kasagam, he has good relationships with neighbors. “I’ve known these people my whole life,” he says. “They know I’m not going to do something detrimental. And if they have an issue, they can come talk to me.”

But his case demonstrates how capriciously the law is enforced and what kinds of issues might arise in the future.

An ordinance is currently being drafted by the Legislative Policy Division that will set guidelines for animal husbandry in the city. It’s been in the works since roughly 2014, soon after the city amended its urban agriculture ordinance.

In its latest form, the proposed ordinance would allow for a limited number egg-laying chickens (no roosters), ducks, and honeybees. Kasagam and Covington both own other kinds of fowl and more than would probably be allowed.

“I’m still going to be illegal even when the ordinance passes,” Covington says.

But the ordinance has not come before City Council despite years of community engagement, research, drafting, and a clear desire for reform on the part of farmers.

Kathryn Lynch Underwood, a city planner with the Legislative Policy Division, has been the main civil servant in charge of the reform effort. When does she hope to have the ordinance passed? “Last year,” she says. “I’ll be as happy as the farmers when it’s done.”

Underwood says it’s important that Animal Care and Control, which enforces the rule, is comfortable with the changes. But multiple leadership changes at the department have delayed the process; it’s currently looking for a new director.

She also wants to go back to the community to educate people and make sure there’s a broad consensus about the changes. And not just for farmers. Underwood says many non-farmers are wary of livestock in cities and their accompanying noises and smells. Animal welfare must be considered as well—cages or pens can’t be too crowded and slaughtering of animals presents more complications.

Much denser cities, like Chicago or New York City, and local ones, like Ann Arbor and Royal Oak, allow for certain kinds of farm animals.

The current goal is to have an ordinance before City Council by the end of the year. But Underwood is cautious about how much she can promise farmers. “We’re trying to come up with a policy that will pass,” she says. “We can always go back in and modify as needed.”

Kasagam, on the other hand, is tired of waiting. For five years, farmers have been promised that an ordinance will be finalized, and in the meantime, she’s at risk for getting fined again.

“I absolutely disagree with Kathryn, even though she is an ally,” Kasagam says. “We’ve been through community hearings. Those pro and those against were there. This needs to happen now.”",[]

A new study challenges the notion that Detroit is rapidly gentrifying and even that gentrification is as harmful as many believe.

Indeed, the analysis by economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia is one of several lately that see more positives than negatives in the changing nature of many urban neighborhoods.

The findings are undoubtedly controversial at a time when many cities are debating the impact of neighborhood change.

“Concern that gentrification displaces or otherwise harms original neighborhood residents has featured prominently in the rise of urban NIMBYism and the return of rent control as a major policy option,” authors Quentin Brummet and Davin Reed write in their study titled “The Effects of Gentrification on the Well-Being and Opportunity of Original Resident Adults and Children.”

But, they continue, “Overall, we find that many original residents, including the most disadvantaged, are able to remain in gentrifying neighborhoods and share in any neighborhood improvements. Perhaps most importantly, low-income neighborhoods that gentrify appear to improve along a number of dimensions known to be correlated with opportunity, and many children are able to remain in these neighborhoods.”

In a finding that many Detroiters may find surprising, the authors say that Detroit has hardly gentrified at all so far. Of the 1,000 census tracts around the country that have gentrified the most, only two are in Detroit, both in the Midtown area, as measured by the influx of college-educated adults. That’s less than 1% of the potential census tracts in Detroit.

The contrast with several other major cities is stark, Reed said in a phone conversation.

“It’s not saying that change isn’t happening in more than two places in Detroit,” Reed said in a phone interview. “It’s saying it’s not happening at the same scale that it’s occurring in D.C. or Portland or Seattle. Certainly, people can be concerned about what’s changing Detroit but it’s just not at the same scale as it’s happening elsewhere.”

Specific findings

First, the authors found that when neighborhoods gentrify, they improve in many ways known to be beneficial for children, such as seeing lower poverty rates and better schools. And they found that many original resident children, including the least advantaged, are able to stay and benefit from those changes.

Some of the long-resident children are even more likely to attend and complete college, they found.

Next, the study disputes the idea that large numbers of people are displaced during the gentrification process.

“The results for children and adults show that many original residents are able to remain in gentrifying neighborhoods and share in any neighborhood improvements,” the authors write.

And while some people are displaced, the actual number is far less than the number who would have moved anyway given the natural flow as people move in and out.

“Gentrification increases out-migration to any other neighborhood by 4 to 6 percentage points for less-educated renters and by slightly less for other groups,” the study found. “However, these effects are somewhat modest relative to baseline cross-neighborhood migration rates of 70% to 80% for renters and 40% for homeowners.”

And even those displaced fare better than often believed, the study found.

“Importantly, we find no evidence that movers from gentrifying neighborhoods, including the most disadvantaged residents, move to observably worse neighborhoods or experience negative changes to employment, income, or commuting distance.”

Familiar findings

This is hardly the first study to find that the dangers of gentrification have been overstated, especially in Detroit. The 2015 “Gentrification in America” study by Governing magazine looked at census tracts in the nation’s 50 largest cities to see whether home prices and education levels had risen significantly between 2009 and 2013.

The study found that Portland, Oregon, Washington, D.C., Minneapolis and Seattle were all hotbeds of gentrification, places where at least 50% of their census tracts had shown dramatic changes in home values and education levels. But Detroit ranked near the bottom, along with El Paso, Texas, and Las Vegas.

Of almost 300 census tracts in Detroit, only seven had gentrified between 2009 and 2013 — just 2.8%, among the lowest of any U.S. city studied in the 2015 analysis.

And tellingly, even those seven tracts in Detroit, widely scattered through the city, all showed population loss during the study period. The seven gentrifying districts had gone upscale in terms of education and home values but had lost ground in other ways.

This is not to suggest that cities like Detroit don't suffer from many urban ills. But Alan Mallach, a noted urban planning expert, writes in his recent book “The Divided City” (Island Press, 344 pages, $30) that gentrification in a few neighborhoods obscures the real problem — concentrated poverty and unemployment in neighborhoods that never gentrify.

""Gentrification may be happening in a few corners of Detroit, but the big story in that city — even if it doesn't get the attention it deserves — is the persistence of concentrated, debilitating poverty and the decline of once-healthy, vital neighborhoods,"" he wrote

Part of the disagreement over neighborhood change is that the word “gentrification” has become a catchall term to mean many kinds of urban ills and trends well beyond neighborhood change.

“One of the reasons the debate is so difficult is because everybody defines things a little differently and that allows certain words to stand in for other things that are happening,” Reed said.

Debate will continue

A study like this is unlikely to still the debate over neighborhood change in Detroit. Indeed, Mayor Mike Duggan’s administration and City Council have increasingly pressed developers building new housing and commercial projects to set aside units for affordable housing or to open retail in the city’s neighborhoods as a way of softening the impacts of neighborhood change.

New York, meanwhile, is in the middle of a fierce debate on new legislative protections for renters to combat rising rents.

But Reed insists that cities are more naturally resilient than the debate over neighborhood change might indicate. Neighborhood change, especially if it means new residents moving into a city, often brings more benefits than harm.

“If you just walk around a lot of these cities, some neighborhoods in Detroit, you do see that neighborhoods seem to be changing a lot,” Reed said. “Eastern Market, the Midtown corridor, they are different than they were 10 years ago. But neighborhoods are a lot more dynamic than the standard narrative assumes.”

https://www.wallpaper.com/architecture/detroit-design-139-urban-planning-exhibition,['Detroit'],Imagination meets urban planning at Detroit Design 139,"The aim of Detroit Design 139 is to start a collective conversation about Detroit’s urban transformation, and it defines ten core design principles for guidance. Innovative projects at this year’s exhibition taking place at four locations across the city include a laundromat/coffee shop, an adaptive re-use project at a former car wash detergent factory and a data portal increasing public accessibility to information about land

The cranes have arrived in Detroit, where striking new developments are transforming a downtown that was recently on life support into a centre of construction and creative reuse. But for Detroit Design 139, a collective of local design advocates from the business, political and non-profit worlds who joined together in 2017, shiny projects in the centre of the city are not enough. They want the turnaround to happen the right way, and throughout the city’s 139 square miles.

That’s why on 31 August they launched their second exhibition ‘Inclusive Futures’, which focuses on more than 60 local projects and initiatives that are not just well-designed, but utilise effective, inclusive processes.

‘We know the money is coming,’ said Melissa Dittmer, a leader of DD 139 and chief design officer at major local developer Bedrock. ‘Now’s the time to start having this inclusive conversation. We should be holding ourselves to a higher standard.’

The exhibition is centred at 1001 Woodward, in the centre of Downtown, with satellite locations in three surrounding neighborhoods. Its juried projects — recently-completed or now-underway — are grouped into the six themes of City Systems, Economy, Housing, Neighborhoods, and Public Space. All follow DD 139’s ten core design principles, which call for, among other things, community engagement, respect for history and culture, promotion of diversity, and, of course, design innovation. And in the great Detroit tradition — from Henry Ford to Albert Kahn to Motown — innovation is definitely on display, and many projects show that Detroit is already becoming a new hub for urban thinking.

As you walk through the Woodward Building’s louvered, labyrinthine exhibition, you’re overwhelmed by smart ideas. Check out The Commons, a combination laundromat/coffee shop that solves the issue of providing basic neighborhood services along with leisure and community. On a wall across the way a display features Detroit Neighbourhood Workspaces, a collection of communal workspaces with very distinct neighborhood voices. Near that is a model of Stone Soap, the upcoming adaptive reuse of what was once a factory for the country’s first car wash detergent company. The restored, red brick building below — which will include a massive new market hall — merges with angular, courtyard-filled new galvanized metal architecture floating above.

Several ideas involve digital innovation, like the City of Detroit’s Open Data Portal, providing all residents access to visualized information maps of city-owned land, permit applications, and other useful sets. Extents Architects’ Online/On-Site helps identify latent opportunities to reimagine some of the city’s many forgotten spaces.

Speaking of forgotten spaces — a huge issue in a city whose population declined precipitously from its peak in the midcentury — another featured initiative is Give a Park, Get a Park, a city project that allows communities to cheaply purchase mid-block lots, and in return receive vacant corner lots nearby; and Good Stock, in which needed Stormwater Infrastructure helps transform vacant lots into parks and other useful spaces.

MINNEAPOLIS—On recent early summer day, Janne Flisrand and John Edwards took a victory lap through their neighborhood.

As they strolled along sidewalks shaded by maples and oaks, they pointed out the variety of single-family homes that give the Lowry Hill East neighborhood its signature look: three-story houses from the early 20th century, with big, white-columned porches. Then they came to a century-old brown brick building, also three stories tall, with rows of windows on both sides of a recessed entryway. The six-unit condominium building from 1910 was flanked by 2½-story blue houses—one a single-family home, the other a triplex. It was mini-tableau of housing diversity that Flisrand and Edwards say has become all too hard to build in their part of town. “We’ve had a really long history of apartments and renters in this neighborhood,” Edwards says. “But 20 percent of the neighborhood wanted to prevent that housing for the last 50 years.”

Well, they won’t prevent it any longer.

Thanks in part to activists like Flisrand and Edwards, Minneapolis just did away with the rules that gave single-family homes a stranglehold on nearly three-quarters of the city. In December, Neighbors for More Neighbors, the group co-founded by Flisrand and Edwards about two years ago to address Minneapolis’ affordable housing crisis, won a victory unseen in any other major American city. The city council approved the Minneapolis 2040 comprehensive plan, which declares the city’s intent to abolish single-family-home zoning and allow duplexes and triplexes to be built anywhere in the city.

“Lots of people want to live here,” said Flisrand. “It’s a great city to live in. And we have used our city policies to keep people out.”

Cities across the country are booming, but their growth is exacerbating an already critical lack of affordable housing for the middle class and poor alike. The solutions being proposed in many cities run the gamut from rent control to federal subsidies, but Minneapolis has landed on something even bolder that strikes at the heart of how cities have grown and defined themselves over the past century. Single-family-only neighborhoods, a staple of city and suburban planning, are woven into the DNA of the American dream: the leafy, peaceful street lined with stand-alone houses, green lawns and plenty of elbow room. Minneapolis’ new vision of itself would essentially rewrite that code—reshaping the urban streetscape around walking and mass transit and rebooting the American dream to be more racially and economically inclusive.

Minneapolis’ new comprehensive plan has drawn praise from divergent political quarters—both Housing Secretary Ben Carson, who visited Minneapolis recently, and the New York Times editorial page. And cities and states with their own growth-driven housing crises are looking to Minneapolis for clues on how to navigate the political shoals inherent in any debate over development and growth. In June, Oregon’s Legislature followed Minneapolis’ lead, approving a bill to end single-family zoning in large cities.

How did Minneapolis do it? In other cities, NIMBYs—conservative “Not In My Back Yard” defenders of suburban-style living—often make alliances with left-wing critics of gentrification to choke off new supply. But in Minneapolis, a progressive city council persuaded a broad coalition of racial-justice activists and nonprofit affordable-housing advocates to align with zoning-reform supporters behind a package of housing efforts meant to help both the middle class and the poor. Along with Minneapolis 2040’s vision of a denser city, the city council also approved $40 million in affordable-housing funds and requirements that some developers include lower-cost units in their projects. New protections for tenants are coming next.

“We’ve avoided a political coalition between folks who want to stop development and [those who] support progressive change,” said Lisa Bender, Minneapolis’ city council president. “In Minneapolis, for now, we have a political coalition that is supportive of adding more housing and demanding a race-equity approach to housing access. Now it’s incumbent on the city to actually do that in a meaningful way. And I’m not sure any city has done that.”

Since 2010, the city grew 11 percent to 425,000 people. People are migrating to Minneapolis to enjoy the vibrant urban scenes on its main avenues near downtown, its vast green neighborhoods of pre-World War II homes, and its plentiful parks along its many lakes and creeks. The Minneapolis-St. Paul region’s economy is thriving, led by prospering Fortune 500 companies such as UnitedHealth Group, Target and Best Buy. But the metro area is adding population faster than it’s adding housing—83,000 new households, but only 63,000 new houses, since 2010. So home-sale prices and rents are going up. In May, the median home-sale price in the Twin Cities area reached $285,000, up 5.2 percent from last year. Hopeful homebuyers face bidding wars. With vacancy rates low, tenants face climbing rents: The average monthly rent of a two-bedroom apartment in the city reached $1,847 this winter, while the vacancy rate is 3.7 percent. (Economists often consider a 5 percent vacancy rate “healthy”; below that, housing costs rise faster than inflation.) Spiking costs now threaten a cornerstone of Minneapolis’ prosperity, as young people find it ever harder to afford living there.

5 Lessons from Cities On Affordable Housing

By Bill Duryea

“Right now in Minneapolis, we have a whole lot of people that want to live here, and we’re proud of that,” said Mayor Jacob Frey. “But we don’t have the supply to accommodate it. And when you’ve got demand that is sky-high but not the supply to accommodate it, it’s just common sense: The prices, the rents, go through the roof.”

Minneapolis’ embrace of urban density began in 2013, when voters elected several young, progressive new city council candidates, including Bender. A Minnesota native, she’d worked as a San Francisco city planner before coming home. “When I moved back to Minneapolis, I saw that housing costs were much lower, but I saw the progression of folks moving in,” she said. “I didn’t see the city having the right kind of aggressive policy in place to keep our city affordable.”

Bender, 41, who became city council president in 2018, nerds out with glee while talking urbanist policy, from housing near transit stops to protected bike lanes. (She founded the Minneapolis Bicycle Coalition, now renamed Our Streets Minneapolis.) “My very first ordinance was to legalize accessory dwelling units!” she enthuses. To build support among reluctant council colleagues, she recruited allies such as AARP, which advocates for so-called granny apartments and garage flats.

“We opened up the dialogue around who gets to live where in our city,” Bender said.

Minneapolis City Council President Lisa Bender cast a wide net for feedback on the 2040 plan, which debuted in 2018 with 100 policies. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine

Next, Bender and her City Hall allies set their eye on Minneapolis’ comprehensive plan, which all Minnesota cities have to update every decade. Usually, these plans are dry policy documents that attract little public attention. Before 2013, Bender said, the city’s feedback was mostly limited to neighborhood associations, so it usually heard from older, white homeowners. This time around, the city council approved an ambitious plan to gather citizen ideas at community meetings, street festivals and farmer’s markets.

This wider approach tapped into the 52 percent of Minneapolis residents who are renters, many of them young and keenly interested in lower housing costs but also climate change, transportation and racial justice. “When we set up enough room for the community to actually weigh in, and not just the folks who are opposed to things, there is a lot of public support for increasing housing options,” Bender said.

By 2017, housing had become a major issue in the city elections. Frey, a young councilman, was elected mayor on a platform of increasing housing density, tripling spending on affordable housing, and reducing residential segregation. “I unabashedly took stances saying that I believe in affordable housing in every neighborhood throughout the city,” said Frey, 37, a Virginia-native lawyer who moved to Minneapolis after running a marathon there.

Frey wanted to increase housing supply to meet demand, but there’s another reason he wanted to end single-family zoning: racial justice. He and others say single-family zoning evolved as a way for Minneapolis and other cities to practice racial discrimination by another name.

Since 2016, Minneapolis residents have exposed their city’s history of housing discrimination in a way that’s unusual for an American metropolis. Inspired by a project that digitized the federal government’s 1930s redlining maps, which declared black neighborhoods “hazardous” for investment, volunteers for Minneapolis’ Mapping Prejudice project have scanned and mapped 17,000 local real-estate deeds with racial restrictions from the 1910s through 1940s.

“When those explicitly racist policies became illegal through the Civil Rights Act, we and other cities throughout the country started doing things implicitly through our zoning code,” said Frey. “And we’ve set it up so that unless you can own a really big home on a really big parcel, you can’t live in huge swaths of the city.”

In 2018, city staff debuted an early draft of the Minneapolis 2040 plan. A broad planning document with 100 policies on everything from carbon-free energy to tree canopies, it attracted the most attention for its “Policy 1,” which called for increased housing density citywide and an end to single-family zoning. The early draft would’ve allowed four-unit buildings everywhere in the city. Larger apartment and condominium buildings could be built closer to downtown and along public transit routes. The new rules applied to renovation and new construction: subdividing houses, building additions, new construction on vacant lots, and new construction after existing housing was torn down.

Not everyone in the city is in favor of the 2040 plan. Anti-2040 lawn signs sit perched in south (left) and north (right) Minneapolis. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine

The initial proposal divided Minneapolis, as opponents rose up to defend single-family zoning. Red lawn signs warned of developers bulldozing neighborhoods to build apartments.

“I’m not sure we bought the argument that more density increased affordable housing,” said Lisa McDonald, a former city council member and a member of the anti-2040 group Minneapolis For Everyone. “We felt we’d get very little affordable housing, but we would be giving developers carte blanche.”

That left Frey, who ran for mayor as a progressive, in the awkward position of defending the for-profit housing industry, which quietly supported the 2040 plan but didn’t publicly advocate for it. “People who need homes can’t be collateral damage in an antideveloper, antibusiness agenda,” he said. “We have people that need the supply.”



***

That’s when the deal-making started.

To overcome the opposition, Frey, Bender and their staffs reduced the promised new zoning in single-family neighborhoods from four-unit buildings to triplexes. They negotiated with council members over changes to future zoning on transit corridors in their wards.

To build a coalition behind the plan, the council voted on two other housing policies the same week as Minneapolis 2040. First, it approved Frey’s budget, which funded $40 million in affordable housing programs, up from about $15 million. Then, the same day council approved Minneapolis 2040 by a 12-1 vote, it passed an interim “inclusionary zoning” ordinance. Common in other big cities, inclusionary zoning requires apartment-building developers to set aside some of a complex’s units for people with below-average incomes. “This city council won’t support making it easier to build housing without a requirement that some of that housing be affordable,” Bender said.

The package deal helped gather support for the 2040 plan from nonprofit affordable-housing advocates, who were lukewarm about zoning for more density.

“It’s great that a city has said we’re going to open up the zoning books and get creative about how we can boost density,” said Russ Adams, executive director of The Alliance, a nonprofit advocate on racial and economic justice issues. “But without regulation, the market is going to behave exactly the way it always behaves.”

Meanwhile, representatives of the for-profit housing industry support Minneapolis 2040’s embrace of higher density but say it won’t likely solve the housing shortage on its own.

“If it produces 50 units in a year, in my mind, it’ll be a big success,” John Rask, a homebuilder and the president of the builders’ group BATC-Housing First Minnesota, said. “I don’t think anyone sees 500 units a year coming out of triplexes. But every little bit helps.” Other parts of Minneapolis 2040, like increased density along transit corridors, should help, he said. But he argues that the city needs relief in parking requirements, lower city fees, and expedited permit and zoning approvals, rather than an inclusionary zoning policy.

Local housing advocates are also skeptical that eliminating single-family zoning will advance racial justice. Minneapolis’s racial disparities are among the worst in the nation. The gaps between white and nonwhite homeownership and poverty in the Minneapolis-St. Paul region are the largest among the nation’s 25 largest metro areas. Three out of four whites in the region own their own homes; only one in four African Americans do. Density in more neighborhoods may give people of color more choices about where to live, but it doesn’t address the wealth gaps that past discrimination helped create.

“The city has to put its money where its mouth is, and redistribute resources to make high density equal affordability,” Dr. Brittany Lewis, an urban affairs researcher at the University of Minnesota, said. “A lot of small developers of color are trying to get in the development game because they want to invest in the communities in which they live. And it’s extremely challenging.”

It is unclear what kind of future awaits Minneapolis, but abolishing single-family-home zoning means that mixed-housing neighborhoods will become increasingly common, with apartment buildings such as this subsidized housing complex looking over single-family homes. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine

Tabitha Montgomery, executive director of the Powderhorn Park Neighborhood Association, feels conflicted about the Minneapolis 2040 plan. “In theory, adding housing units to the city will be helpful to persons of color,” she said. Minneapolis’ low rental vacancy rate especially hurts immigrants and black women, she said. “Our wealth level doesn’t allow us to be competitive sometimes with other persons who are pursuing housing.” But Montgomery isn’t convinced that Minneapolis 2040 will end up benefiting the most vulnerable. She wants the city to focus more on nonprofit affordable housing.

The mayor says he especially wants to help black and indigenous residents become homeowners. Homeownership is a major goal in the city’s $40 million affordable-housing budget. The Minneapolis Homes program, with $5 million funding this year, offers downpayment assistance loans for homebuyers and city-owned vacant land and vacant houses for sale. Frey notes that North Minneapolis, a majority-minority neighborhood, could benefit from the program, since the city owns 300 vacant homes or lots in North Minneapolis alone.

Now the Minneapolis 2040 plan is before the Metropolitan Council, the Twin Cities’ powerful regional planning board, which is widely expected to approve it later this year. After that, the city council intends to enact the planning zoning changes into law. The 2040 plan may become an issue in the 2021 city elections, if its opponents get their way. “We’ll be looking at bringing in some council members who are listening to the citizens more,” said McDonald.

But the mayor predicts the 2040 plan’s results will eventually vindicate his approach. “While people might hate my guts for a couple of years,” he said. “I’m confident that a little down the road, it’ll be apparent that we took the right route.”",[]

Black-owned Mama Sheila’s restaurant at 38th Street and Bloomington Avenue S. will host the inaugural gathering at noon Friday [today] that kicks off Black Business Week, the City of Minneapolis-sponsored, 13-event salute to the nearly 1,000 black-owned businesses in Minneapolis that runs through July 27.

There will be events for employers, budding entrepreneurs, job seekers and others stakeholders.

Mayor Jacob Frey and City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins will host a panel discussion at Mama Sheila’s. It will highlight black ownership and engagement in the restaurant, retail, professional services, manufacturing and otherwise.

“Staying in Minneapolis put us close to a lot of our employees,” Chief Executive Jashan Eison of H&B Elevator, told Frey during a visit this month to H&B’s Northside headquarters and plant. Eishon and his business partner moved the growing company from antiquated space in South Minneapolis.

They have have added employees, particularly from the neighborhood, and sales, as the elevator-cab manufacturer has grown over the last five years, supplying elevators to commercial buildings, stadiums and highrise apartment buildings around the country.

West Broadway Avenue on the Northside boasts numerous black-operated enterprises, from Juxtaposition Arts on the east end, to Sammy's Eatery to Anytime Fitness and Watson Chiropractic on the west.

Black Business Week partners include West Broadway Business and Area Coalition, Northside Economic Opportunity Network, Minnesota Black Chamber of Commerce, Minneapolis Urban League, Robert J. Jones Urban Research and Outreach Center (University of Minnesota), Northside Job Creation Team, E. Howard Co., WeRow, African American Leadership Forum, Minnesota Association of Black Lawyers and Black Women’s Wealth Alliance.

https://tcbmag.com/minneapolis-plans-for-a-future-with-motorized-scooters/,['Minneapolis'],Minneapolis Plans for a Future with Motorized Scooters,"Scooter operators Jump, Lyft, Spin, and Lime are participating in a pilot program aimed at considering long-term plans for scooters in the city, with factors including safety and socioeconomic equity.

Warmer temps in Minneapolis mean a return of the motorized scooters that took the city by storm last summer. In an acknowledgement that they are here to stay (at least until the next rideshare craze), the city of Minneapolis has launched a pilot program to set best practices.

The year-long program is aimed at determining how best to position scooters as a long-term viable transportation option for the city. Minneapolis selected four participating companies for the pilot: Jump, Lyft, Spin, and Lime.

“We’re thrilled that our application has been approved,” says a spokeswoman for San Francisco-based Lime. “We look forward to returning to Minneapolis and furthering our commitment to more affordable, equitable transportation for all.”

Per terms of the license agreements for all providers, the number of scooters allowed in the city is capped at 2,000, with each company getting an equal share of that total fleet size. No more than 800 scooters will be allowed in the downtown area and surrounding neighborhoods, and at least 600 scooters must be available in lower-income areas including north, northeast, and south Minneapolis.

The new program comes after a summer in which motorized scooters, often called e-scooters——exploded onto Twin Cities streets seemingly overnight, particularly those from California-based Bird Rides Inc., leaving the municipalities scrambling to figure out regulations for the vehicles.

When Bird arrived on scene early last summer, Minneapolis had already begun developing an ordinance for parking and licensing rules, so it was able to vote on it fairly quickly, while St. Paul asked the company to remove its fleet until regulations could be formulated.

St. Paul’s request was in vain, as Bird kept its scooters on the streets through the season. There’s been no indication, though, that Bird plans to return to the city this year, and St. Paul hasn’t struck a deal with any other electric vehicle operator yet.

So, as it stands, you won’t find either e-bikes or e-scooters in St. Paul, even as the other half of the Twin Cities sees Nice Ride bikes roll out and the scooter pilot program begin.

The Minneapolis pilot program aligns with the work of the Minneapolis Transportation Action Plan update, a 10-year strategy to implement alternative transportation options that address various issues including climate, safety, and socioeconomic equity.

The pilot program is paying particular attention to socioeconomic equity, with a requirement that operators offer low-income pricing programs and alternative access options (like making them payable by cash) for people who don’t have smartphones.

In regards to safety concerns, operators must provide education and outreach to consumers on safe riding and parking practices. Per state laws, scooters must follow the same road rules as bicyclists, can’t be ridden on sidewalks, and must be parked upright outside of pedestrian walkway space.

“We are excited to able to offer Jump scooters in the Twin Cities and look forward to working with the City to roll out the pilot,” says a Jump spokesperson.

Neither Jump, nor any of the operators have yet debuted their scooters in Minneapolis, but fleets are expected to hit the streets soon—within this spring.",[]
https://www.minnpost.com/metro/2019/09/five-takeaways-from-minneapolis-new-plan-to-boost-street-safety/,['Minneapolis'],Five takeaways from Minneapolis’ new plan to boost street safety,"Minneapolis transportation leaders unveiled a three-year plan Tuesday to boost street safety with lower speed limits, new traffic enforcement officers, additional crosswalks and other roadway changes. Here are the plan’s biggest takeaways, traffic trends that motivated the proposals, and when residents could begin noticing different rules for getting around the city:

The number of people killed or seriously injured in traffic crashes in Minneapolis has gone up

Between the mid-2000s and 2013, the number of severe or deadly collisions on Minneapolis streets decreased, according to city data that transportation leaders shared with City Council members Tuesday. But in 2014, the trend reversed — cause by a spike in vehicle vs. pedestrian crashes specifically — and 2016 and 2017, the city saw the decade’s highest number of incidents in which someone on any mode suffered a serious injury. Last year alone, three people died walking in Minneapolis, and traffic engineers recorded more than 330 additional injuries among pedestrians.

Article continues after advertisement

“Those are not numbers,” said Ethan Fawley, of the city’s Public Works Department, which is leading the plan. “Those are lives — those are people, families forever impacted.”

The troubling trend is the reason for the plan, called Vision Zero, which is part of a nationwide initiative to eliminate all traffic-related deaths and injuries in its roughly 35 participating cities. Fawley and city staff spent the past two years compiling the data to create the draft proposal, which will guide how the city spends money on road safety improvements between 2020 and 2022.

Minneapolis is preparing to lower speed limits.

As Minneapolis’ Vision Zero program coordinator, Fawley and local transportation leaders statewide lobbied state lawmakers this spring to allow large municipalities to establish their own speed limits on city-owned streets, rather than relying on state law. They were successful, and the city of Minneapolis does not want to waste time with making the changes official on the streets it owns. (The reduced levels would not apply to Hennepin County roads or state Interstates.)

“We know that [lower speeds] will save lives,” Fawley said, pointing to studies that show how the severity of crashes often correlates with drivers’ speed. “Higher traffic speeds [make] it harder for somebody to stop, so increases the likelihood of crashes and … increases the chances that a crash could be deadly or lead to severe injury, and that is especially true for people walking.”

Minneapolis’ Traffic Operations Engineer Steve Mosing said reduced speed limits make sense for his city, in particular, due to the complexity of the system — including electric scooters, app-based ride shares, protected bike lanes — and a street grid system with intersections at every 300 to 600 feet.

But it’s not yet clear where, and to what extent, drivers would have to adjust their speeds under the new proposal. A separate ordinance would determine those details, pending City Council approval.

Currently, Minneapolis transportation officials are in talks with those in St. Paul so that they create a consistent plan for new speed limits across the cities, as well as analyzing traffic on a street-by-street basis (most have speed limits between 20 and 40 mph). “It’s important for the city of Minneapolis to have a defensible … study with integrity that’s based on engineering,” Mosing said. “The actual physics and the environment of the roadway plays a huge role.”

Fawley said he hopes to have specific recommendations for reduced speeds by early next year, on which the council will vote.

The first priority is addressing the most dangerous roads and intersections.

The Vision Zero effort has uncovered where, exactly, serious collisions in Minneapolis most often occur, whether because of speeding, distracted driving or other risky behavior: intersections (many of which with light signals) and on streets with higher speed limits (more than 25 mph) and traffic volume.

The plan categorizes those areas as “high-injury” corridors, which make up about 10 percent of all streets in the city — such as University, Central, Lowry, Hiawatha, Hennepin and Franklin avenues, as well as Broadway, Lake and 38th streets.

Over the next three years, crews will go corridor by corridor in those areas to change street designs or add new traffic features to try to keep people of all modes (by car, foot or bicycle) safe. Various pools of municipal money could pay for the improvements, though the overall financial plan is unclear considering the early stage of Vision Zero and how it fits into other safety efforts already under way.

Among changes to the busy streets, crews will convert some four-lane roads (two lanes in each direction) — which could include Lyndale, Third and Hennepin avenues, as well as 31st Street East — into three lanes (one lane in each direction with a center turn lane). They’ll also install new traffic-calming features — such as bollards or delineators — in place of parking spots so that parked cars don’t block pedestrians trying to cross the street, as well as adjust the timing of signalized intersections and add medians in some areas to separate opposing lanes of traffic.

“Putting these types of devices in creates a culture where the most vulnerable piece of the population, which would be our pedestrians, is better acknowledged on our street system,” Mosing said. By 2022, they are hoping to have made improvements to hundreds of intersections alone.

The city is also planning to paint more crosswalks on roads, under guidelines in the draft plan, and update city rules regarding private development to ensure that developers follow traffic-safety standards in their building designs.

Looking at development trends and travel patterns, a Vision Zero engineer — whom the city has yet to hire — will come up with specifics for the roadway changes, Mosing said.

At a Transportation and Public Works Committee meeting Tuesday, when the Vision Zero team presented the draft plan to council members for the first time, elected leaders expressed support for the effort’s plan to modify roadways with additional signs, signal adjustments or new features.

“The more we can manipulate the environment and change the environment to change behavior, the more effective that we’re going to be,” Council Member Cam Gordon said at the meeting. “When you make something structurally impossible to do, people aren’t going to be able to do it.”

The mayor wants a new traffic enforcement unit within The Minneapolis Police Department.

Vision Zero sets a framework for following through with a 2020 budget request by Frey to grow the Minneapolis Police Department’s number of traffic enforcement officers from zero to three.

As part of his citywide funding plan for next year, the mayor announced last month he wants to create a new “Accident Reduction” unit within the police department to monitor for law breakers on the road.

It’s not a novel idea in Minneapolis: The city had a traffic-enforcement unit until 2003, when it eliminated the team “due to reduced staffing levels,” Frey’s budget says. Since then, patrol officers have been in charge of citing roadway users for violations, which can include red-light running or speeding, on top of answering 911 calls.

Pending approval from the City Council in December, Frey’s budget proposal would set aside $355,000 annually, as well as a one-time boost of $207,000, to create the new officer positions and pay for squad cars. Existing sworn cops would fill the openings, and the mayor wants the new team to work with the police department’s existing Traffic Investigations Unit.

The investigations team includes just four people who responded to 4,491 hit-and-run crashes, 609 DWI cases, 181 dispatch calls in which drivers fled the area, 126 squad accidents and 8 deadly collisions last year alone, Frey’s budget says.

At Tuesday’s committee meeting, Council President Lisa Bender, who represents neighborhoods south of downtown, voiced skepticism of the increased focus on traffic enforcement. She said she’d like for the extra attention from officers to focus specifically on areas where the most crashes occur for the best chance of more citations curbing accidents and ensuring equity, yet she still has concerns over the amount of city dollars for the efforts versus other safety improvements.

To address those concerns, Robin Hutcheson, the city’s Public Works director, emphasized that the city is in contact with transportation officials in St. Paul, which currently has a traffic enforcement unit. There, officers base their work on input from traffic engineers, as well as data specific to the capital city and compiled by a University of Minnesota researcher.

“They saw a pretty dramatic increase in compliance,” she said of the new approach, adding that Minneapolis may try to get the same type of U-led study to help the enforcement efforts.

Minneapolis is preparing for automated enforcement technology — even though state law doesn’t allow it (yet).

Vision Zero sets the groundwork for installing technology on streets and sidewalks that aim to catch illegal behavior by drivers, while freeing up officers for other things. The technology could be cameras at signalized intersections to catch red-light runners or speed trackers on neighborhood streets to ensure motorists obey the limits, but the plan does not include details.

But current state law does not permit the technology, and opponents for years have argued that the recording devices infringe on their privacy.

The city of Minneapolis (alongside other jurisdictions) has tried for years to advocate for a change to the state statute, with no success. For now, though, Fawley said traffic engineers are launching a study to determine how they would roll out the technology if, or when, state lawmakers come around to it.

“People should expect that, you know, we are focusing on those [illegal] behaviors so they can address their behavior,” Fawley said.

Looking ahead

Vision Zero is just one piece of the city’s transportation plan. The newly released draft plan fits within broader policy frameworks, such as Minneapolis’ Transportation Action Plan and Minneapolis 2040, which establish long-term goals for street design and traffic improvements as the city grows. Vision Zero also builds upon already-established safety efforts at both the local and state levels.

Once the city closes a public comment period on Oct. 16, Fawley’s team will revise the draft plan based on the feedback and then present a new version to the council in late 2019 or early 2020. They are set to go through the same steps in a few years and create another plan that builds on the latest plan’s proposals.

Hutcheson, the city’s director of Public Works, described the plan as a catalyst to “refine and accelerate” the overall push for better street designs and traffic features to keep people safe. Because one traffic-related death or injury in Minneapolis is one too many, supporters have said.

“This list of folks who died on our streets last year — that is unacceptable,” Fawley said. “Together, we can do something about it.”",[]
https://www.fox9.com/news/minneapolis-city-council-unanimously-approves-ordinance-preventing-tenant-screening,['Minneapolis'],Minneapolis City Council unanimously approves ordinance preventing tenant screening,"article

The Minneapolis City Council voted unanimously Friday morning to approve a controversial new ordinance designed to protect renters.

The renter’s protection ordinance prevents landlords from using old criminal or housing records to deny applicants. Specifically, an applicant cannot be denied if they have a misdemeanor conviction older than three years, a felony record dating back seven years, and more serious offenses that occurred 10-plus years ago. Landlords also lose the use of a credit score during the screening process and there is a new cap on security deposits at one month’s rent.

Previously, property owners could look at someone’s criminal and credit history before renting to them, sometimes going back a decade. Renters said mistakes of the past should not affect their future, especially something from 10 or 20 years ago.

“I am one of the folks who would benefit from this because of the fact that I have had terrible credit for a long time because of student loans and medical debt,” councilmember Phillipe Cunningham said.

The debate at city hall was personal for some, including Lacey Gonzalez, who believes landlords care more about credit scores in the housing application process rather than rental payment history and references.

“No landlord has cared that I have paid rent on time every single month for more than 10 years,” Gonzalez said.

Cecil Smith and other city landlords opposed the new regulations. Among their concerns was the safety of their properties and finding reliable tenants that ultimately may cost them more money.

“The ordinance does nothing to address the underlying problem that Councilman Jenkins raised which is, we just need more affordable housing,” Smith said.

The ordinance passed 12-0.",[]

""It was a very new experience for me. I didn’t know anything about bikes, and I didn’t think I would like it, honestly,"" said Kevin Heger, who is on the bike delivery team. That’s all changed; he’s now trained in bike mechanics and delivery.

""After about two weeks in, I kind of got a feel for it and advanced pretty quickly and it definitely changed my life,"" he explained.

The fresh produce delivery program is being tested and, if it all works, the ability to make these kinds of deliveries allows the bike shop to keep more of those young people employed.

""We’re looking at creative ways to engage young people, above and beyond just bike mechanics, and so this was kind of an excuse to help us do that,"" said Matt Tennant of Full Cycle Bike Shop.

Full Cycle is hoping to get grants so they can continue the fresh produce delivery program full steam next season – and make weekly deliveries to North Market. They also deliver dry food by bike to transitional living programs in the summer and fall, and by van in the winter.",[]

Mayor Jane Castor’s proposal to fix the city’s aging water and sewer systems will see the average residential bill increase from the current $41.29 a month to about $80 by 2028.

Her chief of staff John Bennett told council members the city won’t regret spending billions to slow and eventually end the nearly constant water main breaks and sewer line cave-ins. There have been more than 3,500 such failures in the last two years alone.

“I think it’s time to celebrate what’s underground as much as we celebrate what’s above ground,” Bennett said.

RELATED STORY: Jane Castor officially strips ‘toilet-to-tap’ from plan to fix city’s water and sewer systems

City Council member John Dingfelder was the only no vote. He said he couldn’t support the 20-year length of the program. But his attempt to limit the program to 8 years failed to gain any support from other council members.

Dingfelder, however, successfully persuaded his colleagues to further expand a low-income assistance program that could cost $1.8 million next year if each of the 51,980 eligible families take advantage of it.

Every council member said the new rates are necessary.

“My grandmother is 92 and we have pipes that are older than she is,” said Guido Maniscalco.

Added Joe Citro: “It’s time to stop repairing and start replacing.”

Public works officials said the city currently spends more than $20 million a year responding to water and sewer line breaks or cave-ins. They showed pictures of cave-ins on city streets large enough to swallow a car and streets flooded with sewage spewing from manholes.

Earlier Thursday, Castor smoothed the way for approval of her program by stripping out $300 million dedicated to a proposal to convert wastewater to drinking water. Dubbed “toilet to tap” by critics, it had caused a rift with other local governments, especially St. Petersburg. Last month, five Tampa City Council members came out against it.

Castor also expanded the low-income assistance program by 300 percent ― which the council then expanded even further.

RELATED STORY: Castor sweetens deal on utility package

Customers will see an increase in their bills starting in the November billing cycle. The average bill will increase from $41.29 to $46.50 a month, about half the regional average.

Council member Orlando Gudes joined Dingfelder in requesting that minority-owned businesses be given greater opportunities to win contracts during the massive public works project. Bennett said the city would closely monitor and encourage greater minority participation.

“We need to move the bar and we’re going to work together to move it,” Bennett said.

The mood of council members, though, was positive for having to approve a considerable hike in rates.

Council member Bill Carlson praised Castor for her “political courage” and said he appreciated her willingness to adapt the program to address concerns about wastewater conversion and aid to the city’s poor residents.

Chair Luis Viera framed the issue as the basic nuts and bolts responsibilities of government.

“A long-term solution is required because this is a long-term problem,” he said.

Castor released a statement after the vote expressing disappointment in the council members who opposed the wastewater reuse project, but praising them for the fact that they “rose to the occasion” on Thursday on a “difficult decision.”

The mayor, in office for just over four months, then promised Tampa that the project wouldn’t fade away.

“I always say, you have never seen a ribbon cutting on an underground project. Well, just you wait.”

The price of plumbing Tampa

Take a backhoe and dig a hole 4 feet in the ground at about any intersection in the old city limits of Tampa and you will discover a mostly functioning water and sewer infrastructure built with antiquated materials from the 19th and early 20th centuries, installed by people who have long since died. Although the pipes are still used, many are clogged to a fraction of their carrying capacity by tuberculation of minerals that have built up over time like coral reefs inside of them. Ancient gate valves made of iron with bronze-mounted gate assemblies, originally installed to isolate portions of a pipeline for repair purposes, have seized in their open positions due to mineral deposits and corrosion necessitating more customer interruptions when failures occur.

Many of our gravity sewers are made of vitrified (baked) clay pipe, invented by the ancient Egyptians and still used into the 1980s. Many of these pipes have cracked or their poor joining systems have been choked with plant roots, allowing groundwater to infiltrate the pipes, creating higher sewage treatment costs. Old hand-laid brick manholes, the junction boxes of gravity sewers, replaced by factory-made precast concrete manholes, are also tremendous sources of infiltrated rain and groundwater. Forced sewage mains, made from highly corrosive iron, with no protective lining, are collapsing from hydrogen-sulfide gas eating through the top of the pipes and contaminating everything with the toxic contents. I won’t even get into the stormwater situation.

Clean and abundant water has always been the cornerstone of all civilization. It’s a non-negotiable resource. I must believe if our homes were in such dismal repair, we’d be frantically doing whatever it takes to fix them. We seem to be able to find the money for stadiums, river walks, parks and whatever else entertains us but, we better start finding the money for what sustains us.

Many kids struggle. He makes himself available for tutoring and make-up work at a local public library. I have a daughter who is a counselor at an elementary school where she has to do suicide assessments on children in second through the fifth grade. There have been children Baker-acted from the school. Bullying assessments are common. And before anyone begins to make assumptions, one school is primarily white, the other is primarily black. The problems they face are the same. Folks, these are little kids! How many of the school shooters were like these little kids? We need to do something. Ms. Sullivan’s class sounds like a good place to start. Let’s find a way to save these kids.

A memo from one of the attorneys who oversaw the formation of the Tampa Bay Water regional utility says only Tampa Bay Water can use treated wastewater for anything other than watering lawns. That means Tampa could not legally go forward with using reclaimed water for any other purpose, according to the memo.

“It seems clear that the parties intended to limit the use of reclaimed water by the member governments to irrigation and other non-potable purposes and for Tampa Bay Water to have the exclusive right to utilize reclaimed water for potable purposes,” attorney George Nickerson wrote in the Aug. 5 memo to Tampa Bay Water officials.

“This should be the nail in the coffin” for Tampa’s reclaimed water project, said St. Petersburg Councilwoman Darden Rice, a Tampa Bay Water board member who has repeatedly raised questions about Tampa’s plans.

“In a common-sense world,” she said, no one would want to spend another dime pursuing it.

She also predicted the memo would also save Tampa Bay Water from being torn apart by Tampa trying to launch a water supply venture on its own.

However the most vocal proponent of what the city calls the Tampa Augmentation Project, Tampa Councilman Charlie Miranda, pooh-poohed those comments.

“Attorneys are like tires,” he said. “Once in a while one of them will go flat.”

Multiple attorneys have looked at Tampa’s proposal, he pointed out, but this is the first one to say Tampa is legally prevented from attempting it. In fact, city attorney Gina Grimes questioned Nickerson’s analysis.

“It is our position that Tampa Bay Water’s legal opinion is incorrect as it applies to the City of Tampa,” she wrote in a statement to the Tampa Bay Times. “There are provisions in the Interlocal Agreement granting Tampa an exception to the exclusivity clause. It appears that exception was not fully considered in the opinion and we are preparing a formal legal response.”

Tampa Bay Water is the regional wholesale utility created in 1999 to end the notorious water wars of that decade. Rice and other Tampa Bay Water officials have said they worry Tampa’s project is the first step in trying to break up the utility, but Tampa officials have denied that is their goal.

The Tampa Augmentation Project was a top priority for former Mayor Bob Buckhorn, who left office in May. Tampa officials have said the whole region would benefit from their plan to inject up to 50 million gallons a day of treated wastewater into the underground water table to provide an added layer of cleansing before it is pumped back up into reservoirs and, eventually, faucets and showers.

Critics have dubbed the $350 million project — expected to come online in 2027 — “toilet to tap.” It has faced a string of delays over unanswered questions about whether it would work and whether it would cause harm to the environment.

Tampa officials say that eliminating the minimal nutrients the water currently discharges into the bay from its Howard F. Curren sewage plant would help the environment. They also said the plan would bolster the region’s water resources by allowing Tampa to be virtually self-sufficient in water, freeing up water for needier Pinellas and Pasco counties.

But leaders of local chapters of the Sierra Club and the League of Women Voters have strongly urged the Tampa Bay Water board to reject Tampa’s proposal. They have complained about a lack of transparency, a lack of scientific studies of the potential effects and what they perceived as a rush to gain approval.

Tampa Mayor Jane Castor, who succeeded Buckhorn, has said she also supports the treated wastewater project. But she sounded a noncommittal note Tuesday, releasing a statement that said, in its entirety, ""I am fully committed to working with Tampa Bay Water and regional partners to find sustainable solutions to meet our future water needs while protecting water flows in the Hillsborough River.”

Last month Castor was forced to pull a $661,105 request for public outreach funding for the project from the City Council’s agenda when it became clear she didn’t have the votes to get it passed.

But problems have already arisen. People were spotted riding the scooters in banned areas, such as the Tampa Riverwalk, or parking them haphazardly and blocking sidewalks and entryways, Tampa Transportation Director Jean Duncan said.

""We're hoping maybe it's a little bit of growing pains in the first couple days and we'll see better compliance on the part of the operators as well as the users that we wanted to see from the beginning,"" Duncan said. ""This looks good on paper, but is it going to work in reality?""

The latest transportation fad is solidly in place in several cities, but Tampa has taken its time launching the one-year pilot program, which allows up to 2,400 scooters to operate around town.

PREVIOUS COVERAGE: Will scooters help or hurt the way we get around in Tampa Bay? We're about to find out

As of Tuesday, only two companies — Spin and Bird — currently have scooters out on the streets for people to ride. Competitors Lime and Jump, the other two companies approved for the pilot, should be running here soon, Duncan said.

The scooters can travel up to 15 mph and are meant to help people get to destinations that are too far to comfortably walk, but not far enough to warrant a car trip. Riders rent the scooters through an app on their smart phone.

Spin reported 2,500 trips on its scooters over the weekend. A Bird spokesman said the company does not share ridership numbers.

While people can take trips all over the city, there are a few no-ride zones, including the Riverwalk, Bayshore Boulevard and East Seventh Street in Ybor City. The city contacted both Spin and Bird with complaints that people were riding scooters in banned areas. Bird said its app prohibits people from riding there and will slow the vehicle gradually to a full stop when a rider enters one of those zones.

""Several riders then think the battery is dead and park it nearby,"" Bird representative Servando Esparza wrote in an email to the city. ""Most will follow the in-app notifications to move outside the riding zone to continue riding.""

Spin shared a similar experience, but made a couple additional tweaks to discourage people from riding in those zones and leaving the scooter behind. Spin representative Dan Fleischbein changed the settings so the company's scooters slow down to 10 mph at Curtis Hixon Park and 3 mph in no-ride zones. He also made the Riverwalk a no-park zone.

""It is 3 mph, so it's not rideable, but forces people to remove them from the Riverwalk,"" Flesichbein wrote in an email. ""This appears to solve the problem. We are constantly tweaking and adjusting to create a safe, enjoyable experience for riders and non-riders alike.""

Currently, people can ride scooters only on the sidewalk. That will change if Gov. Ron DeSantis signs a bill sponsored by State Sen. Jeff Brandes and State Rep. Jackie Toledo. The legislation from the Tampa Bay Republicans allows scooters on streets and bike paths, but leaves the decisions up to local governments.

""We thought it was important to get everyone on board early on and make sure that cities have maximum flexibility,"" Brandes said.

Duncan said the city's attorneys are meeting this week to see how, if at all, the new law would affect the contract Tampa signed with the four scooter companies.

In order to try to crack down on the haphazard parking that plagues many cities, Tampa requires scooters to be placed in pre-determined corrals every day. People can then ride the scooter to whatever location they choose and park it anywhere that isn't blocking walkways and traffic.

Duncan said the city had permitted 17 corrals as of Tuesday afternoon, but is approving more each day. That means people can expect to see the number of scooters and the variety of locations grow over the next couple weeks.

Collin Sherwin, 41, took a Bird scooter Tuesday from his home near Hyde Park to his office downtown. The 2.3 mile trip cost him $6.11 — only a dollar or so less than an Uber.

Sherwin said his trips in other cities, like Austin and San Diego, were cheaper. The scooters cost $1 to start, but then vary on how much they charge per minute. Sherwin said he's paid around 15 cents a minute previously, but the cost Tuesday came to around 29 cents a minute, according to his receipt.

Even though a scooter doesn't save him much money and takes twice as long as an Uber (16 minutes opposed to 8), Sherwin said he still would prefer to scooter to work, if the weather was good.

Sherwin, who gave up his car in 2017, said it's more fun and theoretically a cheaper option than taking a rideshare. But the main reason he prefers his bike or a scooter rental is that he feels more connected to his neighborhood with those than he does in a car.

""When I'm on my bike, I see the signs for a cool happy hour or an upcoming event you might miss,"" Sherwin said. ""The advantage with the scooter is I'm not sweating when I get to work. If I take my bike, there's a chance I'm gross all day.""

Brock Bjorn, 33, hasn't had the chance to ride a scooter yet, but said he spotted two near-accidents heading toward Davis Islands. The first involved two people who looked like they were trying to beat the crosswalk signal but were too late, and another was a driver making a right turn while not paying attention, Bjorn said.

Sherwin had a near miss while on his way into work, when a car came close to him while both were making a right turn.

Bjorn said he'd be hesitant to ride in a busier area like downtown or South Howard, but would be interested in checking them out while in his neighborhood on Davis Islands.

""All progress has it's early issues,"" Bjorn said. ""I don't really see any long-term concern aside from them being left in public walkways.""",[]

A reader wondered: Why?,"The stainless steel minarets that flank the University of Tampa campus stand out against the city’s skyline. The tops end in crescent moons, a whimsical contrast to layered skyscrapers.

When Stephanie Carlos, 75, learned of the Tampa Bay Times’ new Florida Wonders series, the towers were her first thought.

“I’m kind of closing my eyes and picturing Tampa, and it just popped in my mind, the minarets,” she said. “And I thought, well, okay, there’s a question.”

Carlos recently joined the Times on a tour of the university’s distinctive Plant Hall, a building that was once the area’s most elegant resort.

Have something you’ve been wondering about the Tampa Bay area or Florida? Ask Florida Wonders.

The former hotel now holds administrative offices and classrooms and takes its name from the hotel’s developer, Henry Plant, a tycoon who extended railroad lines deep into Florida in the late 1800s.

The minarets and the building they stand on are iconic reminders of a glorious past and a signature for a city being transformed yet again.

“When you think Tampa, you think minarets.”

So says Lindsay Huban of the Henry B. Plant Museum.

Huban, the museum’s membership and operations manager, points to prominent images in the community as evidence. Here is the University of Tampa’s black-and-white sketched insignia, an architectural rendering of Plant Hall placed above the school’s name.

Another is the Bank of Tampa’s logo, which depicts the classic minarets in gold. The minarets were actually painted gold in 1981 for UT’s 50th anniversary.

The fact that the minarets are used even now as a symbol of the city shows just how far Henry Plant’s empire reached. When he extended his railroad line to Tampa in 1884, only about 700 people lived in the area.

By the time of Plant’s death in 1899, he had amassed a railroad and steamship system, Huban said, that stretched from Prince Edward Island in Canada to Puerto Rico and Honduras. He built eight hotels in Florida, including locations in Winter Park and Punta Gorda. But the Tampa Bay Hotel, with its minarets, gingerbread woodwork and four grand parlor suites, was his crown jewel.

“This is the only one that is still standing,” Huban said. “This was the biggest and best one.”

Plant initially fell in love with the state in the 1850s when he brought his first wife, Ellen, to recover from tuberculosis. In that pre-Civil War era, the trip was lengthy: Traveling to Jacksonville often meant taking a train, going on a horse-drawn carriage and ending the journey in a canoe.

At the time, Huban said, the state had a land grant program that gave developers acres in exchange for train track laid within certain areas. Plant’s roughly 60 miles of track earned him a significant amount of land.

With the Tampa Bay Hotel, Plant envisioned a place that would serve as a community center for visitors and residents of Tampa. His hotel would eventually house the city’s first performing arts center, a race track and the best restaurant in town.

For the design, Plant wanted something “exotic,” Huban said.

Architect J.A. Wood designed the resort with an eye toward a Moorish Byzantine style popular during the Victorian period.

The red-brick building, a quarter of a mile long, was the first in the state to completely use electricity, earning it the description of a place where “you can read a book any time of day.”

The price for a room started at $5 a night, a stat that led to a laugh from Carlos. But that was about two weeks’ pay for a hotel employee, who would have earned about 40 to 60 cents per day.

The hotel remained open only for about 40 years, from 1891 to 1932. It was only fully occupied in 1898, the start of the Spanish-American War. It was then that about 30,000 troops came to Tampa and staged at the hotel before journeying to Cuba to fight the war. The hotel welcomed Theodore Roosevelt, before he became president, and American Red Cross founder Clara Barton. Those guests helped the structure earn its designation as a National Historic Landmark.

After Plant died, his family began selling off parts of his property. In 1905, the city of Tampa bought the Tampa Bay Hotel and its 125 surrounding acres for $125,000, a fraction of the $2.5 million it cost Plant to build the structure.

The city ran the hotel until 1932, then it proposed that the recently founded university lease the building and preserve part of it as a museum.

Since the transition from a hotel to a university, the minarets have experienced their own growing pains.

In the late 1980s, it was discovered that the minarets had sustained fairly extensive termite damage to their wooden frames. All of Plant Hall was fumigated. Old photos show the building draped in a striped tent.

The minarets are rarely, if ever, open to the public. Those affiliated with the university can see them up close on certain occasions, like alumni or family weekends. The structures span five stories, making up half of the building’s height.

“I think it’s definitely a badge of honor if students have been in a minaret,” said Monnie Wertz, an assistant vice president at the university.

Visit on a random weekday, even during the summer, and you’ll find students bustling in and out of Plant Hall, sitting on its plush, leather chairs. The hall is home to the school’s science wing.

Students are proud of Plant Hall, Wertz said, as a symbol of the city and because it’s so unique.

“Most people when they’re going off to college aren’t sitting in classrooms that used to be someone’s bedroom or have a fireplace in them,” Wertz said.

As Carlos walked through the well-preserved writing and reading room, with its wood-paneled desks and copies of letters written from the hotel, she envisioned a relative.

I’m kind of closing my eyes and picturing Tampa and it just popped in my mind, the minarets. I thought, well, okay, there’s a question. Stephanie Carlos

“My uncle’s aunt would have been just the lady around here,” Carlos said. “She was a school teacher, and I could just see her around all this stuff.”

***

By the end of our interview, Carlos still hadn’t had her question answered. But that’s partially because it’s unanswerable.

When she asked Huban what the minarets represent, her response was direct and succinct.

“Nothing.”

“Just decor?” Carlos asked.

“It’s just decor,” Huban said.

Huban gets that question all the time. In fact, she said, it’s the most common question the museum hears — every single day.

The answer is so simple, it’s almost disappointing.

“There’s no secret meaning behind it,” she told us as we stared at the minarets shining against the blue sky.

“It was just something that looked different, something that would catch your attention, and it works now, 130 years later.”

https://www.tampabay.com/tampa/who-decides-if-a-tree-is-dangerous-tampa-at-odds-with-tallahassee-over-new-tree-law-20190814/,['Tampa'],Who decides if a tree is dangerous? Tampa at odds with Tallahassee over new tree law,"TAMPA—When buzzing chainsaws started cutting into the big Spanish-moss draped trees in a small beat-up trailer park on Gandy Boulevard, word spread quickly among Tampa's tree advocates. City code enforcement officials arrived, citing the tree crew for working without a permit while activists snapped photos. Eventually, police arrived to keep order and everyone safe from falling limbs.

The drama highlighted a battle emerging between cities like Tampa and state lawmakers in Tallahassee around this question: Do cities have any control over how trees are removed?

One of the law's architects, state Rep. Anthony Sabatini, a Howey-in-the-Hills Republican, released a letter last week asserting that local governments had zero role in determining if a tree is dangerous.

""The designation of a tree as 'dangerous' is made solely by the arborist or landscape architect in their professional opinion and expertise, and is not to be supplemented, controlled or effected in any way by a local government,"" Sabatini wrote.

City Attorney Gina Grimes has a different take. She said the city will follow the law, but needs documentation from a certified arborist or landscape architect documented a tree poses a danger to people or property.

""We need to have the documents. We can't force them to give them to us. But if we don't have them, then we have to assume they're removing it illegally,"" Grimes said.

Jonathan Lee, the certified arborist who evaluated the trees on the Gandy property on behalf on an unidentified developer, has yet another interpretation. He says the law doesn't allow him to certify a tree is dangerous, but only to assess the risk level. The decision whether to remove a tree is left up to the property owner.

""If someone thinks a healthy tree that hangs over their children's bedroom is dangerous, that's up to them,"" Lee said.

It's the latest salvo in a ongoing dispute between property owners and environmentalists over the city's touted tree canopy that has raged for years. Before the new law took effect July 1, builders and homeowners complained that city regulations were too stringent. Advocates resisted changing the city's early 1970s ordinance, which they said protected Tampa's trees from being cut down for redevelopment. The two sides reached a compromise in April only to have their work nullified by the state.

But city officials say they're going to enforce the law they say they still control. They cited the tree removal company, Tampa's Miller & Sons, for working without permits. The property is also zoned commercial general — not residential — making it fall outside of the law's scope, which only regulates residential properties, Grimes said.

The case is now headed to a code enforcement special magistrate. And she said the Gandy cutting is a ""poor example"" of the new law, saying she didn't see proper documentation from Lee.

Lee disagrees, saying said he conducted a thorough evaluation of the property's trees and recommended that three grand oaks in good condition remain in place. He says the city has been aware of the cuttings for some time and is acting out of pique, misrepresenting his findings.

""They're upset that they've lost their power,"" Lee said.

Chelsea Johnson, who founded the tree advocacy group that was instrumental in brokering a compromise with builders, said she was angry that the city doesn't have any process in place to stop tree cuttings that may be illegal or without proper documentation.

""Unfortunately, you can't glue them back together,"" Johnson said. ""The city needs to step up to bat to defend our canopy. No tree is safe in Tampa.""

County property appraiser records show a St. Pete-based LLC, Life O'Reilly MHP, as the parcel's owner. Lee said the LLC's owner is working with a developer, who he declined to name. An attempt to rezone the property to allow for 80 residential units and 700-square-feet of office space was shot down by City Council in June, although that decision can still be appealed, Grimes said.

Mark Bentley, the attorney who represented the developer who previously had a contract on the property before City Council in June, told the Times Tuesday that he couldn't provide any information on ownership. That developer, Blue Line Residential, LLC, no longer has a contract on the property.

Life O'Reilly, which listed a St. Petersburg P.O Box as an address, couldn't be reached for comment.

Meanwhile, Joe Chillura, the author of the city's original tree ordinance, cheered council members Bill Carlson and John Dingfelder, who asked Grimes to explore joining other cities in challenging the law in court. Carlson said a legal resolution is a better avenue to fight than trying to change Tallahassee's mind by political persuasion.

""They're inhibiting American democracy by preventing people from living the way they want to in their own communities,"" Carlson said.

Editor's note: Attorney Mark Bentley represented Blue Line Residential, LLC before the Tampa City Council in June. The original version of this story incorrectly identified the party represented by Bentley.

The ordinance eliminates the 4.3 percent sales tax on menstrual pads and sanitary napkins, pantiliners, tampons, menstrual sponges, and menstrual cups. However, state, RTD and cultural facilities taxes will still be collected on those items.

A similar measure introduced in the state legislature in 2017 was postponed indefinitely. The Colorado bill would have eliminated the so-called “tampon tax” statewide and classified feminine hygiene products as a drug, medical or therapeutic devices.

A fiscal impact report generated for the 2017 bill said an estimated 1.5 million women in the state are of typical menstruating age and estimates each woman spends $60 a year on feminine hygiene products, generating about $2 in tax revenue for the state each year per person.

Denver’s ordinance will take effect July 1.

https://www.denverpost.com/2019/03/07/voting-smartphone-blockchain-denver/,['Denver'],Denver will allow smartphone voting for thousands of people (but probably not you),"The city of Denver will allow thousands of voters to cast their ballots with a smartphone application this year.

The pilot program is one of the first U.S. deployments of a phone-based voting system for public elections — but it will only be available to military members and voters living in other countries. The city has invited all of its international voters — about 4,000 people — to use the app in the May 2019 election.

The idea of digital voting has been met with skepticism from some elections security experts, but Denver officials say it could make life easier for a limited set of voters.

“This pilot enables us to offer that convenience for our military and overseas citizens who have the most difficult time voting and participating in the democratic process here at home,” said Deputy Elections Director Jocelyn Bucaro.

Solving two problems?

The system could solve two problems for Denver Elections.

First, it replaces older technology that’s already in use. Under federal law, governments must provide a digital voting option to overseas voters. Denver has for several years offered a website that voters can use to mark ballots. It produces a PDF that is sent through a web service or over email.

RELATED: National popular vote bill passes key test in Colorado House

“It generally gets sent via email, which is not the most secure method,” Bucaro said. Elections technology expert Maurice Turner agreed, saying that email and other earlier technologies are “very scary words” to security professionals.

Digital voting also could help the city meet tight deadlines. Denver’s elections usually involve a second round of voting — the runoff election — about a month after Election Day. That’s not much time to count votes, print ballots and mail them abroad.

Security threats

West Virginia voters used the app in a similar pilot test for the 2018 elections, with about 144 voters participating.

The idea was met with some enthusiasm, but it still faced concerns about security. It’s widely accepted that voting on paper is more secure than digital voting, since paper records are easier to audit and harder to change. Denver’s main voting systems rely on paper ballots.

Denver’s pilot will use Voatz, the same Boston-based company as the West Virginia test. Voatz uses phones’ biometric features, such as face identification and fingerprints. Users have to upload a 10-second video of themselves and a picture of their photo ID to register.

After they’re submitted, votes are stored with blockchain technology, according to Voatz. In other words, they’re distributed across multiple servers in a way that is supposedly unchangeable. It’s the same idea behind bitcoin and other cryptocurrency.

But blockchain also comes with another threat: If attackers ever break the encryption on Voatz’s voting files, they could reveal how people voted, according to Maurice Turner, senior technologist for the Center for Democracy & Technology. It could take years or decades, but sooner or later it will happen, he said.

“In America, we strongly value the secrecy of the ballot, and that’s something that cannot be guaranteed with the current technology,” Turner said.

Voatz says it has taken steps to minimize the risk. The company keeps its blockchain ledgers on private servers rather than distributing them publicly, as cryptocurrencies do, Turner said. In other words, attackers may not have a copy of the encrypted files to hack.

Accessible voting

Amber McReynolds, Denver’s former elections director, said that no technology is completely secure. But mobile voting could be worthwhile as a limited option for some voters, according to McReynolds, who helped launch the Voatz pilot in Denver.

“The reality is, not every voter can vote on a paper ballot without assistance,” said McReynolds, now the executive director of the National Vote at Home Institute. Blind people, for example, may need help filling out a paper ballot. “Given that reality, we have to continue to look for ways to provide voters that need it with options that are secure.”

The Voatz pilot is free to the city. It’s funded by Tusk Philanthropies, with help from the National Cybersecurity Center.

“If the pilot is successful, we’re hoping other cities in Colorado that fall under home-rule might consider using it in some of their local elections,” Bucaro said.

Turner, the technology expert, said it’s worthwhile for cities to experiment with Voatz and other applications. “At least for the (overseas and military) voters, their options weren’t particularly secure to begin with,” he said. The outcomes of experiments like this will help officials respond to the inevitable demands for digital voting, he said.

So far, about 80 people have signed up for the pilot.",[]
https://www.denverpost.com/2019/02/14/denver-teachers-strike-agreement-reached/,['Denver'],"Denver Public Schools, union reach tentative agreement to end city’s first teachers strike in 25 years","Denver’s first teachers strike in 25 years will come to an end after a record-setting, all-night bargaining session produced a new compensation deal shortly before dawn Thursday that labor leaders say will help better retain the district’s educators.

The Denver Classroom Teachers Association initiated the strike Monday, decrying Denver Public Schools’ incentive-based pay system and seeking better wages and more dependable financial advancement for the city’s career teachers.

The walkout by more than 2,600 educators over the last three days left Denver’s schools short-staffed and preschools classes canceled, with substitutes and district administrators filling in, and complaints from students in local high schools that they were being shown movies, given crosswords and otherwise not doing much learning.

The new deal sees DPS putting forward an additional $23.1 million toward teacher compensation, gives average raises of 11.7 percent next year and establishes a new salary schedule that starts at $45,800 a year and tops out at $100,000 annually.

Both the union and the district hailed the bargain struck early Thursday.

“This is a victory for Denver kids and their parents and our teachers,” said Rob Gould, the union’s lead negotiator. “Educators in Denver Public Schools now have a fair, predictable, transparent salary schedule. We’re happy to get back to work.”

DPS Superintendent Susana Cordova said she was pleased by the “collaborative way we worked together.”

“There was a recognition that we share many areas of agreement, and we worked hard to listen and find common ground on the few areas where we had different perspectives,” she said.

Union negotiators put forth what turned out to be their final proposal at 5:30 a.m. Thursday — DPS’s longest-ever bargaining session had been underway since 10:30 a.m. Wednesday — and district leaders broke for about 25 minutes to review it.

“We really only have one change recommended,” Cordova said upon her return. “We’d like to add a signature line to the proposal.”

Cordova and Henry Roman, the union’s president, sat beside each other as they signed off on the agreement and hugged, drawing applause from the teachers and administrators gathered in the basement of the Denver Central Library just after 6 a.m.

“We are recommending now to our members that we officially end the strike,” Gould said.

Because the negotiations had stretched all night, the union had not called off the strike, now technically in its fourth day. But Cordova said teachers are welcome back in the classroom Thursday.

“If you want to come in, as soon as you can, come in,” she said. “We’d love to have you back in the schools.”

Cordova clarified that teachers who do not report to their classrooms on Thursday will have to take an unpaid day off — as they already have been this week during the strike.

DPS’s preschool programs, however, will remain closed another day.

The agreement still must be ratified by a vote of the Denver Classroom Teachers Association’s full membership, then approved by the Denver Board of Education.

Highlights of the deal, according to union and district officials, include:

An average 11.7 percent increase in base salary next year

A “transparent” 20-step salary schedule that starts at $45,800 a year and tops out at $100,000 for teachers with 20 years experience and a doctorate

Full cost-of-living increases in the second and third years of the agreement

The ability to use professional development units — free in-district courses offered to advance teachers’ education — to move up lanes on the salary schedule

An end to bonuses for senior DPS administrators

An additional $23.1 million in funding for teacher compensation

The deal also included a significant compromise on the contentious issue of educator incentives, with the union accepting the district’s increased $3,000 retention bonus for teachers in the 30 highest-priority schools — if a collaborative research study is conducted to determine whether the much-debated incentives work to retain Denver’s quality teachers.

“We are thankful that both sides were able to come together after 15 months of bargaining to ensure our educators have a transparent salary schedule with a professional base salary scale and less reliance on unpredictable bonuses that disrupt our schools,” Roman said in a statement.”

The annual incentives agreed upon include:

A $750 bonus for teachers in 10 distinguished schools

$2,000 incentives for hard-to-staff positions and teachers working at Title I schools

The $3,000 incentive for educators in the 30 highest-priority schools

A $1,000 of tuition reimbursement, maxing out at $6,000 over a career

Cordova called the proposal a strong investment in both teacher base pay and incentives.

Sleeping on the floor

While many teachers called it a night after the session hit the midnight mark, the room had been packed the previous day as educators awaited their fate.

During a particularly long lull waiting for both parties to come back to the table in the downtown library basement, 72-year-old DPS math teacher Kathleen Braun curled up on the floor under her seat for a quick power nap.

The more-than-19-hour bargaining session was the longest DPS negotiation on record.

The exhaustion of never-ending bargaining sessions, picketing and worrying about students was nothing new for Braun, who has now endured three DPS strikes in her lifetime — in 1969, 1994 and this week.

Braun said she didn’t strike for herself.

“I would make less than $200 at this point out of these deals,” Braun said, with the imprint of her jacket zipper still visible on her face from her snooze. “This is for the next generation of teachers and those thinking of becoming teachers. One day, they will replace me, and I won’t be sleeping on the floor of bargaining sessions anymore.”

Gov. Jared Polis, who had declined to intervene ahead of the strike, praised the deal struck by DPS and the teachers union on Thursday.

“Denver’s kids are the biggest winners in today’s agreement,” he said in a statement, “and I think everyone is relieved that the strike is over and students and teachers will be back in school working together to build a brighter future for themselves and our community.”

More than 2,600 Denver educators have hit the streets this week, along with supporters and some of their students, in the name of fair wages.

The issue at the core of the pay dispute, and 15 months of failed negotiations, is a compensation system called ProComp with a complicated history dating back to the 1990s.

Denver’s teachers union has been looking to secure the district’s educators better and more reliable pay increases — rather than the bonuses at the heart of DPS’s incentive-based ProComp system — as those teachers advance through their careers.

The district wanted to ensure any system was financially sustainable in the future.

Even prior to this week’s resumption of bargaining, the two sides had reached a point where they both proposed the same starting base salary for teachers: $45,800 a year. But other areas of contention remained, namely the DPS reliance on bonuses tied to working in high-poverty schools or student achievement.

Negotiations heat up

As the Jan. 18 expiration of the ProComp contract grew closer, bargaining sessions between Denver Public Schools and the Denver Classroom Teachers Association heated up, with some ending in tears and squabbles, with representatives of both sides exhausted and frustrated.

The union voted on Jan. 22 to authorize a strike after its negotiations with DPS failed to secure a new contract governing educator compensation through the ProComp system. At the time, the two sides were about $8 million apart in their respective compensation proposals.

Once the union authorized a strike, DPS officials formally asked Polis to intervene, a move that delayed any strike until the state government weighed its options. The governor ultimately declined to step in — something that could have further delayed a strike by up to 180 days.

After Polis made his decision last week, union officials declared they’d strike on Monday, setting the stage for a final burst of bargaining. Representatives of DPS and the teachers met on Friday night and much of Saturday afternoon.

Saturday’s 11th-hour bargaining session grew increasingly contentious as union representatives rejected a new DPS proposal that would cut 150 central office jobs in an effort to free up $20 million to help with teacher pay. But it also increased incentives to teachers working in high-poverty schools, which has been a sticking point with the union.

The union representatives walked out on DPS negotiators Saturday night, announcing they would not meet with the district against until Tuesday — and that the strike would begin Monday.

The district and union returned to the bargaining table on Tuesday following a day of picketing and student walkouts in support of their teachers. The two sides met for more than 12 hours at the Denver Central Library, trading proposals and meeting in private to go over them.

Following Tuesday night’s session, Cordova expressed optimism, saying, “We can certainly see a pathway forward.”

Cordova and Henry Roman, the union’s president, followed up with a joint statement saying the two sides had “worked in good faith to find common ground.”

“We exchanged proposals that are moving us closer and are hopeful that we will get to an agreement soon,” they said. “However, we need a little more time to resolve the outstanding issues.”

Wednesday’s negotiation session hit the ground running with the district responding to the union’s late Tuesday proposal. As DPS unveiled its latest plan, teachers in the audience — who normally chant protest songs during breaks and occasionally heckle the district during bargaining talks — clapped and snapped their fingers in approval.

The union said it didn’t have questions about the district’s proposal, which came closer to the union in ways educators were able to move across their pay scale and earn professional development credits that could contribute toward their salary.",[]
https://www.denverpost.com/2019/08/04/denver-urban-farming-growing/,['Denver'],Denver urban farming trend grows from a Sloan’s Lake condo tower to a Larimer Square parking garage,"It was 8:15 Tuesday morning and the greenhouse was just waking up for the day.

Spurred by an electrical panel that serves as its brain, its roof vents had popped open, letting in the cool, morning air.

Meanwhile, the human staff of Altius Farms was already busy doing its work. Moving among rows of aeroponic growing towers the pickers plucked leafy greens, herbs and edible flowers like Genovese basil and red Russian kale, washed them and packed them in coolers.

Within hours the harvest would be distributed to some of Altius’ three dozen odd regular and seasonal customers in the Denver area including top restaurants and grocers like Choice Market and Marczyk Fine Foods.

“If you grew this in California and transported it here, it wouldn’t taste nearly this strong,” Altius co-founder and CEO Sally Herbert said, holding up a particularly spicy variety of mustard leaf. “After 1,500 miles in and out of cold storage, the flavor degrades. The nutrient density degrades, too. As much as 80 percent.”

All of the work, mechanical and mammal, was taking place far from Colorado’s agriculture heartlands on the Eastern Plains and Western Slope. Altius is farming in the heart of Denver at 2500 Lawrence St. Its 7,000-square-foot greenhouse sits atop (and helps supply) chic sushi restaurant Uchi and is the visual centerpiece of sustainability-focused condo project S*Park.

The greenhouse is a shimmering glass example of the growing urban farming trend that is now setting down deeper roots in Denver, both in new projects like the soon-to-be-completed Lakehouse tower near Sloan’s Lake and in historic city anchors like Larimer Square.

S*Park was a Denver Housing Authority property before Westfield Co. bought the land it sits on and two other parcels for $7 million. Part of the deal required Westfield to preserve a community garden on the property. The company has done that. Herbert, formerly in the Air Force Reserve, is looking for a fellow veteran to tend to that outdoor plot which was planted earlier this summer. Westfield has also gone beyond that directive by bringing in Altius as one of the marquee tenants in the 91-unit community.

Westfield partner Jonathan Alpert said the goal at S*Park was to find tenant businesses that matched with its sustainable design and mission. Other businesses on the block include a juice bar, a yoga studio and a forthcoming bakery.

Altius plays more than one role there.

The development is dotted with metal tubs residents can use as their own garden beds, with Herbert and crew offering help with cultivation techniques. Altius is establishing a community-supported agriculture or CSA program where S*Park residents and people from across the metro area can subscribe and share in some of what’s harvested as long as they are willing to come pick it up.

“I think all of the communities we build and are involved in are focused on what’s next,” Alpert said. “That was always the goal, to make it easy for people to live this lifestyle in the heart of the city.”

For Christi Turner, S*Park’s focus on sustainability is no fringe perk. Turner, who is renting a studio unit owned by a friend, is the founder of Scraps, a bike-powered compost pick-up service focused on the heart of Denver. S*Park provides her with easy access to her customers and proximity to like-minded businesses like Altius. She hopes to establish a compost drop-off point for her staff on the property.

“It’s hard to grow food in the city. It’s hard to find space, it’s hard to afford space. At the same time, it’s incumbent upon us to figure out solutions,” Turner said. “You throw in vertical gardening that does not require soil … how cool to have that be the showpiece of where you live?”

The 196 condos in the 12-story Lakehouse tower are on pace to be ready for move-ins this fall, but a rooftop farm there is already growing salad-ready produce. The 3,000-square-foot patch on the building’s second-story terrace uses traditional, soil-based methods to grow peas, tomatoes, greens and a host of other veggies, according to Quint Redmond, co-owner of Agriburbia Development.

The Keenesburg-based company has been working with Lakehouse developer Nava Real Estate Development to cultivate the project for four years, consulting on designs from the earliest stages, Redmond said. Where Altius is a startup — S*Park is its first urban farm, though another, larger project is in the works, Herbert said — Agriburbia has been involved in urban farming for a decade, working on projects across the U.S. and other countries. Redmond believes Lakehouse, where a rooftop farm was part of the plan from the beginning, is the first project of its kind in the country.

“It’s not designed to feed everybody in the building. It’s designed to educate everybody. It’s designed to be part of a broader wellness program,” Redmond said. “The main thing was to get food growing on a brand new building and to make it part of the culture. It was a joyous occasion when we harvested radishes there last week.”

Urban farming has already risen to prominence in some coastal cities, aided, in the case of trend standard-bearer San Francisco, at least by tax subsidies. But real estate trend watchers expect it to goes mainstream across the country as people get more in tune with where their food comes from and demand more fresh, healthy options.

In a trends report published in November, researchers with global real estate services firm Cushman & Wakefield wrote, “We expect indoor cropping operations to be a major growth industry in the years ahead.” Projects mentioned in the report include a 26-tower indoor garden at Chicago’s O’Hare International Airport supplying herbs, greens and more to airport restaurants that serve upward of 10,000 people every day. Indoor farming options are viewed as particularly positive because of their low water use, and year-round production, per the report.

In Denver, Cushman & Wakefield broker Joey Trinkle is on the lookout for industrial space to accommodate Castle Rock company Farmbox Foods. Farmbox converts old shipping containers into self-contained mobile hydroponic and aquaponic farms. It wants access to rail so it can send it products to any metro area where it might find clients, Trinkle said.

With competition for industrial space in Denver fierce right now, Trinkle said he isn’t aware of many other urban farming startups looking for space. The big players in the industrial market from a food perspective remain online retailers looking to speed grocery delivery to customers and meal-in-a-box delivery companies like Blue Apron.

“I think we may start to see more sort cues of that sort of thing shifting into Denver,” he said, “but none that I am familiar with at this point.”

One of the most storied blocks in Denver — historic Larimer Square — is embracing urban farming. Earlier this summer, property manager Urban Villages cordoned off the roof of the block’s six-story parking garage on Market Street, built garden boxes and planted 100 plus varieties of plants including more than 50 types of vegetable. It eliminated more than 90 money-making parking spaces in the process.

The company partnered with Larimer Square owner Jeff Hermanson in 2018 to unveil controversial plans to build new, tall buildings along the square, with aims to bring affordable housing and a hotel to the block. Those plans, which would require City Council sign off because Larimer Square is a protected historic district, are up in the air but rooftop gardens, also part of that initial proposal, was something Urban Villages CEO Grant McCargo decided could not wait.

“We’re in a global food crisis. The world doesn’t know it,” said McCargo, who also heads up Urban Villages sister company Bio-Logical Capital and recently helped bring the eco-friendly Slow Food Nations festival to the square.

McCargo said the challenges brought on by climate change mean people need to be growing food everywhere, including on rooftops downtown. “This is not a for-profit venture up here,” he said. “This is for our education so we can plan for the reimagination (of Larimer Square.)”

The operation is being managed by Mike Spade, a New York City native who previously worked on a rooftop farm atop a hospital building at his alma mater, Stony Brook University. The roof is open for public tours on weekdays, with Saturdays being added soon, Spade said. He is exploring additional possibilities for public education and agrotourism on the roof. All food grown there is being given away.

Urban agriculture is not a new concept in Denver. The nonprofit Denver Urban Gardens manages dozens of community gardens across the metro area where people can rent plots. In the Elyria-Swansea neighborhood, GrowHaus is nearing its 10-year anniversary. That nonprofit operates a hydroponic and aquaponic farm to stock its fresh food market (where prices are set on a sliding scale) and fill subscription food boxes as it strives to support a community-driven, neighborhood-based food system that is accessible to people of all income levels.

But things are clearly growing too new levels. Earlier this year, the nonprofit Focus Points Family Resource Center was awarded a $100,000 state grant to plan future community gardens in the Elyria-Swansea and Globeville neighborhoods. Colorado State University is preparing to build a food and agriculture innovation center as part of its three-building campus at the National Western Complex. While it could never replace traditional farming and rural food production in Colorado or elsewhere, Tom Vilsack, the former U.S. secretary of agriculture and Iowa governor now advising CSU on its National Western project, said urban farming does have a role to play in the future.

In part, “it provides opportunities for community development, it provides business opportunities and opportunities for job growth,” Vilsack said.

Kayla Birdsong, executive director of GrowHaus, is all for more locally grown produce. With more people moving into Denver all the time, there are that many more people who need, fresh healthy food. But as entrepreneurs and for-profit businesses get in on the act — each of which competes with her nonprofit organization — she hopes operators will continue to look for ways to give back, whether it be donating extra food or providing jobs in the neighborhood like GrowHaus does.

“There is a responsibility in the business community that is in it for profit to very intentionally map out their road to contributing to their communities directly and ensuring that they are actively working towards equitable food access, especially in neighborhoods that struggle so much with food insecurity every day,” she said.",[]
https://wtop.com/local/2019/09/investigation-urban-poor-hit-hardest-as-the-planet-heats-up/,['Baltimore'],Investigation: Urban poor hit hardest as the planet heats up,"In Baltimore and around the world, in communities rich and poor, downtown and in the suburbs, weather disasters loom. And experts are using language ever more dire.

BALTIMORE (AP) — Heat radiates from the asphalt and concrete that cover the streets, the sidewalks, the alleys, even the tiny yards behind the homes in the East Baltimore neighborhood of McElderry Park. Trees are scarce. And air doesn’t move much when it comes up against block after block of rowhouses.

So as a dangerous 11-day heat wave tormented the city in July, the hottest month ever recorded on the planet, fewer and fewer residents were going outside.

“Can’t even put your head out the door,” said Tammy Jackson, 48, on a day when the temperature outside hit 100 degrees Fahrenheit and 92 degrees in her home. “This is too much. Oh Lord, this is too much.”

But it is going to get worse. In McElderry Park and around the world, in communities rich and poor, downtown and in the suburbs, weather disasters loom. And experts are using language ever more dire.

Average annual temperatures in Baltimore have gone up more than 3 degrees over the last century, nearly twice as much as the rest of the country.

More and more people, including Del. Robbyn Lewis, who represents parts of East Baltimore, are replacing the words “climate change” with stronger language.

“We are,” she said, “in an emergency.”

Cities, crowded and paved-over, already feel the impact, with poorer air quality and streets, highways and bridges damaged by storms. But certain neighborhoods will continue to feel the effects of extreme temperatures more than others.

Researchers at Portland State University in Oregon and the Science Museum of Virginia have mapped these areas, called urban heat islands, and data shows that temperatures here and in surrounding neighborhoods can run 8 degrees hotter than in communities that have more trees and less pavement. McElderry Park, which despite its lyrical name offers little green space, is one of these.

Residents in the hottest areas have higher rates of chronic illnesses affected by heat, including asthma and COPD. In hot weather, emergency medical calls for some chronic conditions increase. The rate of emergency medical calls for cardiac arrest and congestive heart failure, for example, nearly double when the heat index hits 103 degrees.

Households in the city’s hottest areas have lower incomes, which means the residents don’t have the resources to move out.

This is true across the country. In a majority of the country’s most populous cities, people with lower incomes typically lived in the hottest areas, an investigation by journalists from NPR and the University of Maryland found.

Sacoby Wilson, a professor at the University of Maryland School of Public Health, says people in low-income neighborhoods walk more, ride more buses and drive fewer cars, so they contribute less to climate change. And yet they are more vulnerable to dying in extreme heat.

“Environmental justice and climate change,” Wilson said, “are inextricably linked.”

Rowhouses, Baltimore’s signature architecture, trap heat and stay hot even when the heat eases on summer nights. Crime rates are higher, so many people won’t put an air-conditioning unit in a first-floor window for fear of break-ins.

The problems are not new. Many stem from historical segregationist zoning and lending policies that for decades limited where black citizens could live.

During an 11-day July heat wave, Baltimore’s health department put out press releases advising citizens to drink water, cut back on outdoor activities and find relief in designated air-conditioned cooling centers. Inside the rowhouses, even those with an air-conditioning window unit, the heat simmered.

Reporters from the University of Maryland’s Howard Center for Investigative Journalism and Capital News Service placed sensors that record heat and humidity inside several homes in McElderry Park and nearby neighborhoods. Those sensors recorded temperatures that reached as high as 97 degrees and heat index values of 119 degrees.

In some homes, those readings showed that it was hotter inside than outside.

At 7 p.m. Friday, the heat index in Baltimore hit 103 degrees. Inside the bedroom Stephanie Pingley’s niece shares with one of Pingley’s three sons, it was 13 degrees hotter, with a heat index of 116 degrees. All of her boys have asthma.

By Saturday, the heat index inside the second-floor apartment of Michael Thomas and Alberta Wilkerson hit 112 degrees. A fan pushed hot air around. Thomas, 61, has emphysema. Wilkerson, 49, has had a heart attack.

“Just living through it,” Thomas said.

On Sunday, Solomon Simmons, who is retired from a job at the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, went to Hope Community Church, where he is a deacon. “We had trouble getting the church cool,” he said.

Simmons, 71, will not put an air-conditioning unit in a first floor window facing the street “because of security.” But especially for children, older residents and people coping with chronic diseases, air conditioning is the answer.

Tammy Jackson, who has asthma, said she had to stop cooking dinner one July evening when the heat made it hard for her to breathe. The next day, she told her husband, “Baby, I can’t cook until I get AC.”

Twenty people have died of heat-related illnesses in Maryland so far this year, three of them in Baltimore, according to data through Aug. 28.

Historically, the Baltimore area has averaged about six days a year when the heat index exceeded 100 degrees, according to new research from the Union of Concerned Scientists and the University of Idaho.

If no action is taken to reduce carbon emissions, by mid-century that figure will rise to more than 37 days annually, according to the researchers.

As temperatures in Baltimore reached 100 on July 20, most everyone around the city was staying inside. “This is the quietest the block ever been,” Tammy Jackson said. “I can’t believe it.”

But city life continued despite the heat. A team of paramedics was called to an East Baltimore block when a resident found a man she didn’t know passed out on her front steps.

The paramedics revived the man, who apparently had overdosed, with a dose of Narcan. He stood up and wandered off, rejecting advice he go to the hospital.

We should ... use nature to make our lives better.”

Much of the understanding of how trees affect everything from climate to criminal justice stems from a technological breakthrough pioneered in Baltimore that lets scientists synchronize forest maps with other data including health records, census figures, crime statistics, and property values. The insights reveal some striking trends: Crime declined when tree canopy coverage went up. Temperatures spiked in areas with fewer trees, and with more trees, housing values increased.

With concern growing about climate change and rapid worldwide urbanization, city forests have emerged as one solution to a host of social and environmental challenges. In 2015, the World Economic Forum named increasing green canopy coverage as one of its top 10 urban initiatives.

National press about Baltimore tends to focus on the negative – the violent crime rate, ingrained poverty, and police force and school problems. What the headlines don’t often share is that the city is a model for green management, one that has gained attention as a successful urban forest experiment.

From his headquarters office, Erik Dihle drives into what has become one of the most monitored forests in the United States.

He begins to point out the trees: There is a tulip poplar, as big as the ones George Washington planted at Mount Vernon. There are the blossoming cherries, with a cotton-candy display that rivals their famous compatriots down the road at the Tidal Basin in Washington, D.C. And there is a white oak, Maryland’s state tree, with its branches gnarling horizontally for yards.

“This is a good-size one,” he says, getting out of his truck to pace the area of shade created by the tree’s canopy. “I’d be surprised if it was less than 150 years old.”

A few blocks away, someone lays on a horn, and traffic begins to move along one of this city’s main arteries. Construction vehicles beep as they repair an old municipal reservoir. And Mr. Dihle jumps back into his truck, ready to show more trees.

Mr. Dihle’s forest is in the city. He is the arborist and the head of forestry for the city of Baltimore, which means he monitors all the trees here – those growing in shady parks, in metal grates along busy streets, in backyards, and in relatively untouched forest patches dotting the municipality. Together, these trees make up what is called the city’s “urban forest,” a type of ecosystem that is gaining attention at both the national and international levels among everyone from environmentalists to politicians, social justice advocates to corporations.

Melanie Stetson Freeman/Staff 'Between the tree canopy and the urban forestry here we are making a difference,' says Erik Dihle, arborist for the city of Baltimore. 'It all ties together. ... It ties into social equity, into climate adaption, everything.'

With concern growing about climate change and rapid worldwide urbanization, city forests have emerged as one widely touted solution to a host of social and environmental challenges. Municipalities from Barcelona, Spain; to Melbourne, Australia; to Chicago have put urban canopy coverage at the center of their long-term strategic plans. Community groups focusing on planting, maintaining, and saving trees have blossomed across the U.S. In 2015, the World Economic Forum’s Global Agenda Council on the Future of Cities named increasing green canopy coverage as one of its top 10 urban initiatives.

Yet at the same time, the U.S. Forest Service, which in the past decade has also upped its focus on urban forests, has found that American cities are losing trees – and quickly.

A Forest Service report published last year found that across the U.S., populated areas lost about 175,000 acres of trees per year between 2009 and 2014, or approximately 36 million trees per year. Forty-five states had a net decline in tree cover in these areas, with 23 of those states experiencing significant decreases. Meanwhile, urban regions showed a particular decline, along with an increase in what the researchers call “impervious surfaces” – in other words, concrete.

But not, it turns out, in Baltimore.

Here, the net tree canopy coverage has increased. Not by a lot, Mr. Dihle is quick to point out – only from 27% of the city’s land coverage to 28% – and not because Baltimore hasn’t lost trees. It has. But overall the tree canopy here has grown, which means that Mr. Dihle has found himself presiding over one of the more successful efforts in the U.S. to preserve and improve the urban forest.

It’s become an improbable green model for cities around the world.

Melanie Stetson Freeman/Staff A tree stands in front of colorful row houses in the Reservoir Hill neighborhood of Baltimore. The city is a leader in mapping and protecting urban forests.

The intersection of trees and urban living

Trees have been in cities, of course, for centuries. Documents from early New England settlements include rules and regulations about how residents should make use of trees growing on town commons. Many municipalities appointed tree wardens to make sure everyone followed the law. Even the modern concept of urban forestry has been around since the 1960s, when officials in the Johnson administration looked toward nature, and trees in particular, to help revitalize urban landscapes that they perceived to be crumbling.

But in recent years, scientists say, demographic trends have shifted attention toward the urban forest in a new way.

Across the world, there is a rapid and increasing movement of people from rural areas to cities. In 2009, the United Nations estimated that 3 million people worldwide moved to a city every week. By 2015 more than half of the world’s population lived in urban areas, according to the U.N., with the number of city dwellers expected to grow from 3.9 billion to 6.7 billion by 2050.

The same is true in the U.S. More than 80% of Americans live in urban areas, even though cities account for only 3.6% of the country’s landmass.

At the same time, new technology has let researchers better understand the urban ecosystem – not just how trees thrive or fail in a city, but how they intersect with humans.

“They impact work productivity, wildlife habitats, air pollution removal, carbon sequestration, energy use,” says David Nowak, senior scientist with the U.S. Forest Service who authored the recent national report on tree canopy loss. “We might as well work with the forests. Nature is giving us this amazing resource. ... We should be smart about this whole process and use nature to make our lives better.”

Melanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Trees are absent in front of mostly vacant row houses in the Old Goucher neighborhood, a low-income, high-crime area in Baltimore. Statistics show a correlation between the presence of trees and crime – areas with fewer trees have higher crime rates.

Much of the understanding of how, exactly, trees affect everything from climate to criminal justice stems from a technological breakthrough pioneered in Baltimore.

For decades, scientists recorded their data on paper, filling notebooks and filing cabinets. With the advent of computers, foresters were able to tabulate and analyze the information in a new way. By the 1990s, satellite imagery allowed governmental agencies such as NASA to produce visible images of Earth and to show on various scales where trees existed.

But there was a limit to those pictures, explains Morgan Grove, a scientist with the U.S. Forest Service who has worked in Baltimore since 1999. Because the data were recorded in pixels, not physical parcels, it was difficult to identify, say, the owner of a particular tree, or to compare what was happening from one city block to another.

In 2006, though, the Forest Service, working with researchers from the University of Vermont’s spatial analysis lab, put together a new type of land cover map in Baltimore using a combination of aerial imagery, light-reflecting technology, and high-resolution landowner data. This novel approach not only allowed a closer look at trees, it also let scientists synchronize forest maps with other information that was also newly computerized and manipulable – everything from health records to census figures, crime statistics to property values.

“Now we can talk about trees and how they relate to other systems,” Mr. Grove says. “Our ability to combine data systems in novel ways – we couldn’t do that 30 years ago.”

The insights revealed some striking trends. Crime declined when tree canopy coverage went up. Temperatures spiked in areas with fewer trees, an effect known as a “heat island,” and with more trees, housing values increased.

With parcel-by-parcel data, city officials could see precisely where trees had been removed and where canopy had increased. They could zoom in on a particular block, or even a house, and see which trees existed there as well as the age, health, and size of the stock. They could also determine how much carbon sequestration, cooling effect, and crime mitigation any particular tree gave a city. And from there, researchers could put a dollar figure on a tree, an approach that fit a larger trend of environmentalists trying to show the value of natural resources in monetary terms.

Melanie Stetson Freeman/Staff 'Once you take a tree down, you replace it with another tree. The main goal is to increase the tree canopy in the city,' says Lawrence Wynter, an urban forester in Baltimore.

Cities around the country and world began implementing the technology and started to notice additional patterns. In London, for instance, officials found that in areas with greater tree canopy coverage residents took markedly fewer prescription antidepressants. One neighborhood in Chicago found that a tree initiative saved each resident nearly $100 in heating and cooling costs. In New York City, advocates armed with statistics about the financial impact of trees launched a hugely ambitious – and ultimately successful – effort to plant 1 million trees in the city within 10 years. Today, scientists in New York are using tree maps to show areas most in need: places where trees could help cool neighborhoods heavily populated with elderly, minority, and impoverished residents.

Around the world, as scientists mapped more and more trees, they understood better how urban forests affect everything from land use to natural disaster mitigation.

“Baltimore was the first place where we did the whole city,” Mr. Grove says. “Now we have done the entire Chesapeake Bay watershed. We’ve done the whole Northeastern U.S. It would cost some money, but it’s possible to do the entire U.S. Which [would be] transformative.”

Baltimore, an improbable green model

Baltimore is perhaps an unexpected model for green management. The city has not been building a reputation for governmental effectiveness recently: During the first week of May, Mayor Catherine Pugh resigned amid corruption allegations, while a week earlier a former city police officer was sentenced to nine years in prison for helping run a drug gang with other officers. National press about Baltimore, when there is any, tends to focus on the negative – the violent crime rate, the ingrained poverty, the struggles of its police force and school system.

But what the headlines don’t often share is Baltimore’s long-standing environmental focus. Sitting on the Chesapeake Bay, the city is headquarters for numerous researchers and environmental organizations studying and protecting the country’s largest estuary. It was this work that led to the city’s leading role in urban ecology.

In the late 1990s, scientists were trying to figure out how to reduce the amount of nitrogen in the bay. For years, agricultural runoff and urban pollution had been despoiling the ecosystem. Because of other research done in more rural areas, scientists believed that one solution was to plant trees alongside streams and inlets. But when they started testing, explains Mr. Grove, they discovered that, for a number of biological reasons, a better way to reduce nitrogen in the Chesapeake Bay was to plant trees throughout Baltimore.

Soon, the National Science Foundation took interest in the work and funded what would end up being a 20-year ecological study in the city. It was one of the first big investments in urban ecology, Mr. Grove says, and the roots of the tree map initiative.

Melanie Stetson Freeman/Staff 'There’s a mythology that people in urban environments don’t like nature,' says Katie Lautar, executive director of Baltimore Green Space.

Now Mr. Dihle, the city arborist, uses that tree map regularly. Along with the age, location, and species of trees, his department can harness the technology to note which of the city’s 2.6 million trees need pruning, whether any are sick, and which neighborhoods are due for tree maintenance.

This way, he says, “we make sure those trees are not falling down in a storm, not becoming a nuisance to the neighborhood. ... We don’t wait for it to be a complaint.”

Not only does this keep residents happy but it also maintains canopy coverage. Large, older trees have far more leaf span, and thus ecological impact, than newly planted trees.

“We all love the new tree plantings,” Mr. Dihle says. “We like to get our picture taken and there we are with the shovels and the schoolchildren all around. But when I got here the concern was the mortality rate: how many [of the new trees] are still alive four or five years later.”

Urban forest crusader

Mr. Dihle arrived in the city eight years ago. He had just retired from the U.S. Department of the Army, where he was a civilian in charge of managing the 12,000-tree Arlington National Cemetery. Some people were surprised when they heard that Mr. Dihle was planning to spend his retirement working for Baltimore, and in a position that, as Mr. Grove says, requires him to be able not only to cut down a tree and cut up a tree, but also to “be one of the most patient people in the world. And deal with disasters.”

But with the laid-back vibe of his California upbringing, Mr. Dihle responds to questions about this with a shrug and a smile.

“I think I can make a difference,” he says. “And between the tree canopy and the status of urban forestry here, we are making a difference.”

He moved to a neighborhood close enough to bike to forestry headquarters, the entrance of which is now graced by a sculpture of Dr. Seuss’ Lorax wearing hiking sandals. Mr. Dihle says he found a city far different from what the headlines and reputation suggested. Baltimore had not only a deep scientific base, he says, but also great neighborhoods, a revitalizing downtown, and the sort of community activism that makes environmental innovation possible.

Melanie Stetson Freeman/Staff A tag on a willow oak in Wilson Woods indicates that it has been inventoried as part of a local effort to preserve the city’s forested areas.

“We’re at the forefront of a lot of green infrastructure,” he says. “We have a lot to champion.”

Across from his office desk is a stuffed raven – a reference to either hometown poet Edgar Allan Poe or the professional football team, depending on one’s inclination – and a rubber rat, the tongue-in-cheek city mascot. Nearby are bumper stickers and posters for many of the city’s environmental nonprofits. One of Mr. Dihle’s jobs is to coordinate these different organizations. Together they work under the “TreeBaltimore” umbrella and use the city’s tree map data to coordinate tree plantings and maintenance, neighborhood cleanups, and various other initiatives.

There is Blue Water Baltimore, which works to restore the quality of the city’s various waterways. The Baltimore Orchard Project helps plant fruit trees in community gardens around the city. And Baltimore Green Space both works as a community land trust and helps preserve “forest patches” – usually small, and often overlooked, swaths of woodland that dot cities.

Appreciation for a precious urban resource

Springfield Woods is not on Google maps. But walk to the end of Springfield Avenue, or across the street from the low slung, red brick Maplewood Apartment complex on St. Georges Avenue, and it is there: a cool bit of forest in the historically African American neighborhood of Wilson Park on the northwest side of Baltimore.

Butch Berry has spent most of his life going into Springfield Woods. When he was a kid in the 1960s, he remembers playing there, often by the stream that still babbles through the trees. When he came back to the family home in the early 2010s, after working as a cartoonist in Los Angeles, he was drawn to it again.

Melanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Baltimore resident Butch Berry stands in a clearing in Springfield Woods, a patch of forest he and other neighbors help maintain.

But by then the woods were different. People dumped trash at the edge of the 3.5 acre parcel. A handful of homeless people had made a campsite in the middle. Poison ivy had snarled the underbrush. Mr. Berry asked around about whether anyone in the neighborhood association was doing anything to keep up the woods. Eventually, he started just picking up trash himself.

“I figured, what are they going to do – arrest me for picking up litter?” he says with a laugh.

Later, he reached out to Baltimore Green Space, to see if the group might help him take care of Springfield Woods. He had heard of the organization because it had recently gotten involved in trying to save another forest patch, Wilson Woods, a few blocks away.

As Katie Lautar, the group’s executive director, describes it, area residents had contacted Baltimore Green Space because they heard that a landowner planned to mow down a vacant acre of old hardwood trees that residents had long used. Until then, Baltimore Green Space had mostly focused on community gardening projects.

But the idea of a city forest was intriguing. It was a situation, Ms. Lautar says, where people simply didn’t see a natural resource in front of them.

“Sometimes folks have, in the wider environmental world, a block about thinking of nature in urban spaces,” she says. “I say that as someone who grew up in Baltimore. I got my master’s in environmental education and came back and I had never noticed these spaces.”

After a number of meetings with residents, who asked to know about the mini forests, she reached out to scientists who could help study the ecological impacts of forest patches and explore how people use them. The group discovered that not only did the forest patches provide important habitats for native species and significant cooling effects for surrounding homes, but they often played an important role in neighborhoods.

“There’s a mythology that people in urban environments don’t like nature,” Ms. Lautar says. The truth is that people use and love the woods. Their research found that the vast majority of some 80 forest patches in the city showed signs of human stewardship – trails, benches, or places where people had weeded. Or there was a person, like Mr. Berry, who had started picking up trash.

Ms. Lautar decided to use Baltimore Green Space’s community activism model to protect these mini forests. Today, the group supports neighborhood “forest stewards” who take the lead in caring for woods.

On one recent morning, for instance, Charles Brown was working on the edge of the remaining half acre of Wilson Woods. Mr. Brown, a retired cab driver, comes by every few days to work on the trail, pull out invasive vines, or plant new seedlings.

Melanie Stetson Freeman/Staff Federal Hill Park, which is filled with trees, overlooks the harbor in Baltimore.

“I used to drive by this every day and didn’t notice it,” he says. Now, it’s one of the places in his neighborhood that gives him joy. “It’s peaceful. You get a sense of accomplishment.” He pauses and gives a wry smile known to gardeners everywhere. “If you ever finish anything.”

Meanwhile, Mr. Berry’s Springfield Woods has become a showcase for urban forest patches. Since Baltimore Green Space began its partnership with him, volunteers from around the neighborhood and beyond have come into the woods to pull out the poison ivy, build trails, and haul out trash.

“We found everything in here from a vacuum cleaner to an old gun,” Mr. Berry says.

Now there are benches and clearings and a sign at the edge of the forest welcoming visitors. Mr. Berry and Baltimore Green Space have hosted events in the woods, including an edible hike, in which participants cook food harvested from the forest. When the group recently organized a “haunted woods” evening, more than 90 people attended. There is still trash, but much less of it, and Mr. Berry has watched as the same neighbors who once used the woods as a dump now yell at people throwing litter from their cars.

“Between the tree canopy and the urban forestry here we are making a difference,” says Mr. Dihle. “It all ties together. ... It ties into social equity, into climate adaption, everything.”",[]
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/15/us/politics/schools-immigration-trump.html,['Baltimore'],Immigrants Brought Riches to Urban Schools. Now They’re in the Shadows.,"Under one proposal, the administration would broaden the range of public assistance programs — such as Medicaid, food stamps and housing vouchers — used to determine whether immigrants seeking to become legal residents would be “public charges” on the country. That would effectively expand the programs that some immigrants may seek to avoid as they erase themselves from government assistance. Administration officials said the change would “promote immigrant self-sufficiency and protect finite resources.”

Another rule would evict undocumented immigrants and their families — even family members in the country legally — from public housing, including 55,000 children. And the administration’s decision to ask on the 2020 census whether respondents are citizens stands to skew official poverty rates, the single most important data point for federal education funding, by depressing the response of immigrants — documented and undocumented. The Supreme Court will rule this month on the legality of the census question.

Trump administration officials say these proposals will give policymakers a better sense of the country’s population while preserving scarce resources for people living here legally. But schools are in a squeeze: By Supreme Court decree, they have no choice but to educate children, regardless of their immigration status.

In a Supreme Court filing protesting the Census Bureau’s new citizenship question, the Council of the Great City Schools, a coalition of the nation’s largest urban school districts, noted: “It would be ironic indeed, if the bureau was not required to count noncitizen children when this court has held that public school districts, including council members, are constitutionally compelled to educate those same children.”

Michael Casserly, the executive director of the council, said the cumulative effect of the administration’s immigration policies would be extensive.",[]

The City’s computer network’s files are unusable as a result.

Councilman Leon Pinkett took to Twitter on Wednesday to say the city email servers and office phones were still shut down. He clarified that the numbers 311 and 911 were still operational.

RELATED COVERAGE:

Pinkett advised anyone who needed assistance to email District7Matters@gmail.com.

Mayor Jack Young released a statement confirming the issue Tuesday.

“Baltimore City core essential services (police, fire, EMS and 311) are still operational but it has been determined that the city’s network has been infected with a ransomware virus. City employees are working diligently to determine the source and extent of the infection. At this time, we have seen no evidence that any personal data has left the system. Out of an abundance of precaution, the city has shut down the majority of its servers. We will provide updates as information becomes available.”

Frank Johnson, Baltimore City’s Chief Information Officer and IT Director, joined Mayor Young in a new conference on Wednesday.

“We can say with confidence that public safety systems are up and operational, 311 is operating, the city phones are operating,” Johnson said.

Federal investigators asked the city to stay tight-lipped about details of the hack.

“Unfortunately there’s a race between the bad actors and the cybersecurity industry,” Johnson said. “Just as they know how to mitigate and keep the bad things out the bad guys go one step ahead of them in this vicious race.”

Ransomware blocks users from their files and demands payment to unblock them.

Mayor Young said the city won’t be blackmailed.

“No, I would not pay a ransom to anybody,” Young said.

All city employees are at work whether they can do their jobs or not. Mayor Young also has an alternative in mind.

“If we are in this for longer than we anticipate, I will be asking city employees who really can’t do their work because of the computer systems would they be willing to go out and help us clean up the city,” Young said.

It is unclear when the computer network would be back in use.

In 2016, hackers took over MedStar Health’s database.

In March of last year, a similar attack compromised Baltimore’s 911 operations for more than 17 hours.

For this recent cyber take-over, one of the biggest inconvenience to residents has been not being able to pay bills.",[]

Riverside, Calif. – The City of Riverside has received more than $32 million in funding from the state’s “No Place Like Home” and “Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities” programs, money that will be used to construct 278 new, affordable housing units throughout the city.

The successful effort to attract state funding that will facilitate four new housing developments represents a return on investment of more than four times the City’s initial outlay, successfully leveraging Riverside funds for the benefit of residents who need safe and secure places to live.

“I’m especially pleased to see the State of California come forward as a partner to build these homes, including some that are attainable for hard-working people of limited means, veterans and our neighbors without homes,” Mayor Rusty Bailey said.

Riverside projects receiving state funding include:

Mission Heritage Project, a 72-unit affordable housing project in the downtown neighborhood, with a 22-unit set-aside that will be reserved for veterans. This project is being built with $16.8 million in assistance from the Affordable Housing and Sustainable Communities Program, including more than $10 million for the housing project and $6 million for nearby integrated transit improvements. The City’s financial commitment is $3 million.

Oasis Senior Villas, which received $8.2 million in support from the state’s No Place Like Home Program (NPLH), will consist of 108 units in the Eastside neighborhood benefitting low-income seniors, including people who are previously homeless and living with mental illness.

St. Michaels Project, which will receive $4.3 Million in NPLH Program funding to construct 49 units of housing for extremely low-income residents in the Arlington neighborhood. The City participated with project assistance of $2 million.

Cedar Glen II, which includes 49 units of affordable housing in the La Sierra neighborhood, received $3.3 million of NPLH Program assistance. The City provided project assistance of $650,000.

The City participation in the development of this housing is pursuant to its approved Permanent Supportive Housing Strategy — www.riversideca.gov/h1plan — a ten-year plan to provide housing units and support needed to lower the City’s homeless population.

An important partner in the effort is the Riverside University Health System, which is the administrator of No Place Like Home funds.

“We are very pleased with the announcement of this funding and are excited to move forward to provide much-need permanent supportive housing in Riverside County,” said Matthew Chang, M.D., Director of Riverside University Health System’s Behavioral Health Program.

The funding announcement comes as availability of affordable housing continues to dwindle nationwide. According to a 2019 National Low Income Housing Coalition report, California residents earning a $12.00 minimum wage would need to work 91 hours each week to afford a modest one-bedroom apartment at a fair-market rent. More specifically, in Riverside’s Eastside neighborhood, a worker would need to earn over $21/hour to afford a one bedroom apartment.",[]

Riverside, Ca – The City of Riverside will bring together representatives from local governments around Southern California to discuss what strategies are working to reduce the incidence of homelessness and how various agencies can work together more effectively.

The Oct. 23 event, which is not open to the public, will give elected and appointed officials at the city and county level the opportunity to share information, foster an even greater sense of cooperation and identify resources that can be utilized across the region.

“We know that government works best when it breaks down silos and finds best practices,” Mayor Rusty Bailey said. “This forum will present a great opportunity to share information and build towards a common strategy for increased cooperation on this key issue.”

Cities and county governments in Riverside and San Bernardino counties are expected to send city managers, city administrators, mayors, mayors pro tem, police chiefs, sheriffs and homeless and/or housing managers to the event.

Each agency is expected to present a 10-minute overview on that agency’s efforts to combat homelessness and challenges that agency is experiencing. In addition to the overview, officials are being asked to prepare remarks on current and future strategies being implemented.

Some of the agencies already work together by virtue of being in close proximity to one another, but regional leaders in the effort to reduce homelessness have never come together on this level before.

“Homelessness is affecting every community in the Inland area, so we must make sure that we all are pulling in the same direction,” said Riverside City Councilmember Chuck Conder, who conceived the idea. “It’s heartening to see our region’s leaders coming together to share our insights.”",[]
https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/protest-in-riverside-at-first-peaceful-then-confrontational/2372899/,['Riverside'],"Protest in Riverside at First Peaceful, Then Confrontational","More than 4,000 people converged on downtown Riverside Monday to protest police brutality and march in remembrance of George Floyd, killed while being arrested last week by a Minneapolis policeman, raising chants and taking over city blocks in a demonstration that turned confrontational, culminating in arrests.

At least a half-dozen people were taken into custody at the end of the protest, which involved Riverside County sheriff's deputies firing anti-personnel rounds, possibly rubber bullets, to disperse the crowd at Orange and 10th streets about 7 p.m.

According to reports from the scene, the demonstration was largely contained until that time, when some of the participants may have started lighting fireworks and casting them in the direction of deputies and Riverside police officers manning a skirmish line along 10th.

Echoes of what sounded like shotgun blasts reverberated throughout the downtown space between 7 p.m. and 8 p.m., as protesters were pushed back.

It was unclear whether anyone was hurt.

Deputies and police officers formed defensive perimeters at 10th and Lemon streets, as well as Orange and 10th streets, gradually advancing to the east and north to clear demonstrators from the area. Dozens of activists fled the location ahead of the advancing riot squad members.

California Highway Patrol officers were summoned to assist, and seven patrol units fanned out in the area of Lemon and University Avenue about 7:45 p.m.

Sheriff's officials said that by 8:15 p.m., most of the demonstrators had vacated the downtown space.

A trash bin fire near the historic Mission Inn Hotel & Spa and several broken windows along Orange were reported but no other vandalism or break-ins.

Riverside police helicopter Star Nine was in a constant hover over the area from 4 p.m. to 8:30 p.m., and law enforcement agencies additionally sent up camera-equipped drones to monitor developments.

The demonstration got underway just before 4 p.m. at the closed Main Library, across from the Mission Inn at Orange Street and Mission Inn Avenue. Black Lives Matter and the Brown Berets were among the organizers.

As a large crowd massed around the library's front entrance, throngs of people gravitated to the location, building up numbers as different speakers led the demonstrators in chants that included “Black lives matter; blue lives murder,” “No justice, no peace,” and “I can't breathe.”

Like similar demonstrations that burgeoned in cities across the nation last week, the one in Riverside was predicated on the death of 46-year-old George Floyd, a black man who died during what Minneapolis police say was an act of resisting arrest. Officers Thomas Lane, Tou Thao and Derek Chauvin have been dismissed because of the death and what has been alleged by Hennepin County authorities as excessive force and a deliberate act of violence.

Chauvin is under arrest, facing murder and manslaughter charges.

The Riverside protest was replete with derogatory outcries, with some participants repeatedly shouting “(expletive) the police,” but at no time in the first 2 1/2 hours of the outing did there appear to be acts of aggression, physical violence or intimidation, as has been witnessed in Los Angeles, Dallas, New York City and other locations.

As a precaution, the windows on most of the businesses in the immediate vicinity of the protest zone were boarded up.

At the Main Library site, protesters spilled into the streets by 4:20 p.m., and with a crowd of supportive motorists honking and slowing, the marchers formed a loose train that initially went north on Mission Inn, then east on Market Street, south on Fifth Street and back west on Orange, where the demonstrators re-assembled before continuing along Orange toward the Riverside Historic Courthouse and Robert Presley Detention Center, three blocks to the west.

At the intersection of Orange and 10th streets, sheriff's deputies and Riverside police officers clad in riot gear deployed in a skirmish line backed by mobile barriers and tactical vehicles.

Sheriff Chad Bianco arrived within a few minutes to supervise, as the protesters massed at the intersection, in front of the closed District Attorney's Office headquarters, about 4:50 p.m.

The chanting resumed, while participants waving signs that read “Justice for George,” “Get off my neck,” and “Abolish all prisons” paced in front of the riot squad. Only a few attendees turned belligerent, hurling profanities and shaking their fists at the law enforcement officers. Several organizers called on the aggressors to back off, and tensions were defused.

On several occasions, the protesters were asked to kneel on the street, in honor of Floyd and others who died in police custody.

A counter-demonstration of sorts took place overhead, as a single-engine airplane towing a banner circled the protesters in three-minute intervals. The banner read: “We love the police. USA thanks you.” A red heart symbol was at the tail end of the message.

By 5:45 p.m., the core protest began to fizzle and small groups splintered, with people going in different directions. The city of Riverside ordered a 6 p.m. curfew, declaring that all non-emergency and nonessential activity was to end on the streets. The protesters who stayed at 10th and Orange were in violation.",[]

Cheaper housing and the steady stream of new logistics-related jobs have fueled sizable population growth in the Inland Empire in recent years, especially in Riverside County.

Riverside County saw the fifth highest population growth in the U.S., adding 33,000 new residents in 2018, according to census data compiled by real estate developer JLL.

While California’s population increased by 0.5% last year, the growth was twice as high in both Riverside and San Bernardino counties. Riverside County saw 1.1% percent growth, with Beaumont, at 4% and Menifee at 3% seeing the biggest increases.

San Bernardino County had a population growth of 1% percent last year. The cities that were the biggest draws were Chino at 2.6% and Ontario at 2.3%.

The JLL study cited the expensive housing in coastal counties but also weighed the effect of logistics jobs in the area, which are not as available in Los Angeles and Orange counties.

“Many of the cities in the IE with the greatest population gains — such as Chino — are also seeing a robust amount of warehouse and distribution construction,” the report stated.

ePac expands to Chino factory

ePac Flexible Packaging, a fast-growing Florida company that makes environmentally friendly packaging for the food industry, will begin production in June at a new facility in Chino.

The company is already taking orders at its 25,000-square-foot facility at 5475 Daniels Street. The location was selected to take advantage of the Los Angeles-area market, the company said.

The firm opened in Delray Beach, Fla., in 2016 and expects to have 19 locations by the end of the year. ePac met with officials from San Bernardino County, which made sure the company was aware of various economic incentives, including a $2.3 million tax credit.

The Chino facility is expected to employ more than 70 people. Several job openings, including customer service rep and machine operators, were posted on the company’s website as of Friday.

Colton complex sells for $63 million-plus

A large apartment complex in Colton has been sold for $63 million, and the new owners plan to pump $4 million into the development in a renovation effort, according to a statement.

The District at Grand Terrace, a 352-unit multifamily development, was bought by San Diego-based Tower 16 Capital Partners. The seller, in an off-market transaction, was Irvine-based FPA Multifamily.

The District at Grand Terrace, located near Barton Road. will see upgrades to outdoor spaces and interior renovations.

Tower 16 has purchased six apartment communities in the last 12 months, totaling 2,000 units. This is the second Inland Empire purchase.

Riverside apartments sold

University Gardens and Normandy Apartments, two apartment complexes between downtown Riverside and UC Riverside, have been purchased by developer La Barge Industries. The prices were not disclosed.

LaBarge Industries said it will provide enhanced amenities at the communities.

The company, with offices in Ontario, has developed more than 3,000 apartment communities and acquired and rehabilitated more than 1,500 units.

Riverside to vote on new ordinance,"There are benefits to owning chickens, Denning said. Chickens eat bugs, such as ticks, and she has not found any on the family dog. They can be a protein source for lower income families who might not be able to afford eggs.

Chickens lay four to six eggs a day.

The planning commission worked to construct a document that was simple but structured to make the rules clear and concise. The guidelines would include:

— No more than six chickens, ducks or a combination of the two.

— Lot is a single-family dwelling, no apartments

— No property shall own, keep or harbor a rooster

— Chickens and/or ducks should not cause noxious odors or in unsanitary conditions that results in a public health concern

— Must have a covered enclosure and the animals must be kept in the covered enclosure or fenced enclosure at all time, plus shielded from the street

— Enclosure must be located in the rear of the yard

— No enclosure can be located closer than 25 feet to any residence on an adjacent lot unless there is a buffer around the property that can include a fence that is six feet in height

— No enclosure can be located closer than 10 feet from a property line Residents cannot sell the eggs A permit is required to ensure compliance with the regulations

If the ordinance is passed, the council will review with the planning commission in a year the data to see if there have been more or less complaints about the animals and if the ordinance needs to be continued or amended.

Denning said there are people in the city that do not follow under the current ordinance but have chickens on their properties.

Xenia has a similar ordinance in their city with the same guidelines except they can have chickens on a five acre or less property, according to City Planner Brian Forschner.

Beavercreek, Fairborn, Kettering, Oakwood and Centerville do not allow chickens or ducks on residential properties. All have considered it in the past, but it has never passed or brought to the table.

Riverside city council will vote this Thursday to pass or reject the proposed ordinance from the planning commission at 6 p.m. The council meeting will be at city chambers at 5200 Springfield Street.",[]

The intended outcome of this smart city effort – in collaboration with both the city and the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) – is to enhance public safety and efficient and effective operations across all city departments.

The pilot will take place at T-Rex, the downtown St Louis technology innovation centre.

Interoperability framework

Through this pilot, the partners will research, design and test the Smart City Interoperability Reference Architecture (SCIRA) as an interoperable framework that integrates commercial proprietary Internet of Things (IoT) sensors for public safety applications at the community level.

“With this pilot, we will be able to engage stakeholders in St Louis to test how their technology can meet real city needs,” said William Bryan, senior official performing the duties of the under secretary for science and technology.

“The city of St Louis joined the federal smart cities initiative in an effort to improve public safety, among other objectives. We, at DHS S&T, are honoured to work with the city and OGC as we continue to serve our colleagues in public safety.”

The goal of the SCIRA pilot is to integrate and test existing real-world technologies that can augment, and even improve, all day-to-day city operations and emergency response capabilities.

“With this pilot, we will be able to engage stakeholders in St Louis to test how their technology can meet real city needs”

The pilot will test the technologies’ performances and ability to enhance public safety via a series of major flooding, flash flooding, vulnerable population outreach, and building fire scenarios.

Through the project’s findings, cities could have open, interoperable methods for incorporating smart city technologies into across city services using shared technology standards.

“Community level application of existing technologies is essential for a 21st century city to adequately deliver services to its residents and provide for their public safety, as well as enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of all city services,” added Lyda Krewson, mayor of St Louis.

“The way our residents live, work and play is continuously evolving and their government must evolve with them. I am excited to be partnering with DHS S&T and OGC on this very important smart city effort.”

The rally was part of the Global Climate Strike, a wave of demonstrations around the world led by 16-year-old climate activist Greta Thunberg to demand that governments transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy. The strike came ahead of the United Nations' Climate Action Summit in New York City on Monday.

Young people want to see Congress pass legislation, like the Green New Deal, to prevent the worst consequences of climate change, said Emilio Rosas Linhard, 17, a senior at Clayton High School.

“We know that summers are getting hotter and hotter, and we know that we keep on pumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere,” Linhard told the crowd. “So why aren’t we doing anything?”

Multiple groups, including the youth climate advocacy nonprofit Sunrise Movement, organized the protest in St. Louis.

Among the participants were eighth graders from the Waldorf School of St. Louis who ditched school. Nora Howerton, 13, held a sign that she cut in the shape of a dinosaur.

“I don’t want us to go extinct like they did,” Howerton said.

Eli Chen | St. Louis Public Radio

At the rally were local environmental advocates, religious leaders and politicians, among them Board of Aldermen President Lewis Reed. He sponsored a 2017 resolution that aims for the city of St. Louis to generate all of its electricity from wind, solar and other renewable energy sources by 2035.

“The Clean Energy Board has spent hundreds and hundreds of hours developing a plan for the city of St. Louis that’s going to roll out soon that will set the course for us moving towards 100% clean energy,” Reed told the crowd.

Eli Chen | St. Louis Public Radio

Activists at the strike also stressed the importance of relieving environmental burdens on low-income and minority communities.

After nearly two hours of speeches and chants, protesters marched down to Keiner Plaza and back to City Hall. If the protesters weren’t involved before in environmental issues, the climate strike may inspire them to take action and volunteer with an environmental group, said Jackie Kinealy, an activist with the Al Gore nonprofit Climate Reality Action.

“It’s important for us all to come together and realize it’s much bigger than not using a straw,” Kinealy said. “We need to join together and show the people in power that we’re serious and that we’re not going away.”

https://www.city-journal.org/st-louis-better-together-proposal,['St. Louis'],St. Louis Blues,"Better Together, a drive to consolidate the governments of St. Louis County and its towns with the city of St. Louis, was over almost before it started. Following political blowback and the indictment of the St. Louis County executive who would have run the merged government, backers withdrew the proposal. But the problems that prompted it—regional demographic and economic malaise, fiscal distress, and segregation—aren’t going away. Attempts to shake up the region’s governance are likely to continue.

St. Louis is a rare “independent city”—not located within a county, that is, but existing as its own separate entity. Baltimore and some cities in Virginia are also organized this way, but few others. St. Louis was once part of St. Louis County. In 1876, however, city officials, unhappy with the county government, managed to push through a secession in which a newly enlarged city was carved away from the county. Practically speaking, the independent city of St. Louis was equivalent to a combined city-county government. In 1950, its peak population year, St. Louis was the eighth-largest city in the United States, with a population of 856,796, which even today would make it our 18th-largest municipality—bigger than Seattle, Denver, or Boston. Its land area of 62 square miles exceeds those of San Francisco and the District of Columbia. For a long time, independent St. Louis thrived, and separation from the county looked like a smart move.

But after 1950, St. Louis fell into steep decline. Its population has shrunk to 302,838, a drop of 65 percent—worse than Detroit’s population loss. The region has stagnated, too; the population of the larger metro area fell slightly last year.

Once a major regional business center, St. Louis has seen a dramatic erosion of civic standing. Local giants like Anheuser-Busch, McDonnell-Douglas, and Ralston Purina were bought out and reduced their local presence. TWA was acquired by American Airlines, which eliminated its hub in St. Louis. Southwestern Bell (now part of a reassembled AT&T) moved to Texas. As Brian Feldman documented in Washington Monthly, St. Louis once had a thriving professional-services industry in sectors such as advertising that served national clients; today, its services firms mostly have local clients. True, St. Louis retains several Fortune 500 companies and a large financial-services industry base, boasts an elite private school in Washington University, and remains a center of plant sciences, as well as being part of a major region of almost 3 million people, with significant economic activity and serious cultural assets—and the St. Louis Blues hockey team just won the Stanley Cup for the first time. Nonetheless, the city is clearly much less prominent than during its postwar heyday.

Regional stagnation has exposed many other civic issues, such as heavy segregation and jurisdictional fragmentation. St. Louis County is dotted with 91 municipalities, most very small, and many fiscally distressed. A number have turned to abusive ticketing practices to raise funds. The county’s problems blew up in Ferguson in 2014, where the police shooting of Michael Brown led to weeks of unrest. While state and federal investigations found the shooting justified, the resulting attention revealed many serious problems with how St. Louis suburbs were conducting business.

Many observers believe that reorganizing local government is necessary. Some have advocated that the city of St. Louis rejoin the county and become an ordinary city again. Others argue for a full consolidation of government between the city and county, pointing to merged city-county governments like Nashville and Indianapolis as positive examples. Urban planners have long viewed regionalized government, including city-county mergers, as a holy grail of good governance.

Better Together, a plan created by local leaders and heavily funded by local billionaire Rex Sinquefield, would have recombined St. Louis city and county and merged their governments. The existing St. Louis municipalities would have continued to exist as “municipal districts” but would lose authority over police, courts, roads, and economic development, as well as chunks of their revenue streams. Fire and school districts would stay independent. The plan was touted as a money-saver that would generate significant efficiencies, allowing the elimination of the local earnings tax, a long-time Sinquefield priority. Backers planned to implement the merger through a citizen-initiated amendment of the Missouri state constitution, to be voted on statewide.

Many aspects of this plan, which directly targeted abusive municipal police and courts, were well designed. Knowing that any kind of government merger is always hugely controversial, the planners took a light hand with their changes, not attempting to abolish existing municipalities completely.

But problems abounded. The projected savings were almost certainly a mirage. Unlike in corporate mergers, in government combinations municipal employees rarely lose their jobs or take pay cuts. In fact, the opposite is more likely—that wages and benefits would increase. Indeed, backers pledged in advance not to lay anyone off. The plan to implement a statewide vote also gave opponents an opening to criticize the plan as undemocratic. And complaints arose from some minority-group leaders, worried that their electoral clout might be reduced, as well as from some city advocates, fearing a takeover by the much larger suburban voting base. The county executive, in fact, was slated to be the transitional mayor. That proved the plan’s undoing, after he was indicted.

Good reasons exist to question a city-county merger for St. Louis. These reorganizations consume immense civic time and attention that could be devoted to other priorities. The merger wouldn’t save money. And unlike mergers in Indianapolis and Nashville, which happened more than 50 years ago, this plan would not combine an older city with growing suburbs, but rather, join an older city to suburbs that are themselves old and stagnant. To the extent that new suburban growth is occurring in St. Louis, it’s farther out, in places like St. Charles County.

Nevertheless, merger talk continues. Backers have already said that they plan to resurrect the idea. St. Louis clearly faces regional demographic and economic challenges as well as acute problems with its micro-suburbs in St. Louis County. While a merger would not be a silver bullet, it might disrupt the status quo in a way that opens new possibilities. Whatever it decides to do, St. Louis needs to do something.

https://news.stlpublicradio.org/economy-business/2019-06-05/st-louis-maps-effort-to-become-magnet-for-geospatial-industry,['St. Louis'],St. Louis Maps Effort To Become Magnet For Geospatial Industry,"Inside Good Life Growing’s newest urban garden, co-founder James Hillis is using an iPad to pull up maps of the city. The urban agriculture organization is trying to reduce food insecurity in north St. Louis, and mapping tools help him figure out where to plot new grow spaces.

Hillis’ maps look fairly simple, but they’re powered by Geographic Information Systems data that pulls in all kinds of factors about the local community.

“I’m able to download prime urban farmland that overlaps with vacant lots throughout the city. I can look at low supermarket access as well, so I can begin to understand different variables that associate with food insecurity,” said Hillis, who is also a doctoral student at St. Louis University studying geospatial technology.

This kind of technology is not new to St. Louis. The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency has been developing it here for decades for defense purposes. Now, as it prepares to break ground on its $1.75 billion western campus just north of downtown, city government and business leaders are making a major push for the NGA to anchor a burgeoning industry.

“Let’s put the flag in the ground there. St. Louis is the nation’s center for geospatial excellence,” St. Louis Mayor Lyda Krewson declared during a recent event at IT startup incubator T-Rex.

Corinne Ruff| St. Louis Public Radio

That’s a message she’s reiterating this week in San Antonio on the national stage during a keynote address at the largest annual geospatial conference. In 2023 and 2025, that conference — along with its 4,000 attendees — will come to St. Louis.

City officials say it will be a major opportunity to sell businesses and talent on St. Louis.

By the numbers

The local economic impact of the geospatial industry is $4.9 billion, with nearly 11,000 people directly employed in the sector, according to figures recently calculated by the St. Louis Development Corporation.

“Geospatial has a strong root system here in St. Louis, with the NGA being the real anchor for us,” said SLDC Director Otis Williams.

“But there are a number of industry types and organizations that are already here. There are a significant number of jobs that are already here.”

The NGA has about 3,000 workers at its current campus in south St. Louis. The federal agency also creates new jobs through contract work.

Esri, which provides geospatial intelligence software and consulting to commercial agriculture companies and local governments, announced plans last month to double its workforce by the end of the year. That would bring its total workforce to 80 employees, split between its offices in St. Charles and in the Cortex district in Midtown. Another 40 jobs could be added next year.

While Esri has a dedicated team that works with the NGA, this new hiring push is for the “everything-else market,” said Matt Harman, head of the Esri Professional Services team in the Midwest.

What’s unique about the growth of the geospatial industry is that it intersects with nearly every business sector, according to AllianceSTL Senior Vice President Jim Alexander.

His newly formed economic development organization sees itself as the touchpoint for all new businesses looking to call St. Louis home. It’s also focused heavily on recruiting those that may have never considered locating in Missouri, or the Midwest for that matter.

In order to tap into the high growth potential he sees for geospatial, Alexander says his group needs to start building coalitions with other industry sectors that are increasingly using the technology.

“Think of things like precision agriculture. So we need to bring those folks to the table. Utility companies, financial services, health care — all of these individual sectors are going to be relying more and more on geospatial to grow their businesses,” Alexander said, adding that St. Louis is in a unique position to bring these kinds of industries together.

“I see the geospatial sector as holding really great promise for our region because we’re the home of NGA West — no one else can make that claim.”

Building an ecosystem

While the NGA may be the anchor, it can’t build an industry alone. The federal spy agency is beginning to open up its blackbox to startups and researchers that can help push the envelope on innovation.

By the end of the year, T-Rex will debut what it’s calling “Geosaurus” on its fourth floor. The Bayer-funded innovation space aims to bring together intelligence from the NGA, advanced IT startups and academic researchers and students studying the field, according to T-Rex Executive Director Patty Hagen.

T-Rex

“So you have data science, data management, agile development, open-source development, artificial intelligence, machine learning — every aspect of advanced IT is encapsulated or incorporated into geospatial industry and technologies.” Hagen said. “So it’s a great hook for a lot of the things we’re doing here.”

She sees potential not only for IT startups but businesses and city governments of all kinds.

“There are incredible usages for location intelligence that can better inform both agriculture and conservation, efforts around climate change that will be important for all of our communities and for the world as we move forward,” she said. “All of that kind of intelligence is highly needed now.”

The geospatial industry is growing at a rapid clip. Globally, it’s forecasted to become a more than $400 billion industry by 2020, according to the 2018 Geobuiz report.

That’s what makes it an investment worth the time and energy of so many public and private officials, Hagen said. It’s a long-term bet that the geospatial industry will spur not only technology advancements — but economic growth in the region, too.

“There isn’t really a great example of anything like this happening before in the nation, where there is a very advanced technology, and a federal agency lands a brand-new campus in what has been an underserved area in St Louis,” she said. “I think this is going to be studied for a long time to see what will happen to our community as this plays out over the next few years.”

Good Life Growing’s Hillis will be watching closely as the industry blossoms in St. Louis. He said the push for geospatial innovation is a good thing, but he also has reservations about what role St. Louis residents will get to play.

“Maps can be tools for persuasion, and so it’s very important that it is developed here within the area,” he said. “But at the same time, as it develops, how can it do so hand in hand with the local community that is there?”

https://www.archpaper.com/2019/09/bleutech-park-las-vegas-smart-city-controversy/,['Las Vegas'],Is Bleutech's Las Vegas smart city on the level?,"“We’re working on a project that will blow your mind” is the first thing one sees when visiting the website for Bleutech Park, a Las Vegas “engineering firm” with the tagline “The future of infrastructure.” The firm is responsible for pitching what was anticipated to be the Las Vegas Valley’s $7.5 billion smart city, revealed earlier in August. The mastermind behind the futuristic development? Janet LeGrand, formerly known as Janet Garcia, a Florida woman with a history of alleged fraud and seeking out high dollar construction contracts, according to the Miami Herald.

Announced earlier this Summer by Bleutech Park Properties, Bleutech Park Las Vegas was promised to be the “first digital infrastructure city of its kind in the world,” complete with autonomous vehicles, 100-percent renewable energy, AI, “supertrees,” and self-healing concrete structures, among other features that sounded perhaps too good to be true. It was expected to break ground this December and take six years to complete, despite the fact that many of the technologies promised in the proposal are still in their infancy (and commentators on AN‘s original article voiced similar suspicions).

As it turns out, the Miami Herald has been reporting on LeGrand’s alleged transgressions since July 2017 when she first attempted to use an allegedly “fake” engineering firm, Bleu Network Inc., to score a $33.3 million construction contract with Homestead for a similar urban venture. She was then arrested, booked into Miami-Dade County Jail, and later filed a lawsuit against the city. In December 2017, she was charged again for wage theft, after allegedly failing to pay her employees hundreds of thousands of dollars.

While the Miami-Dade charges are set for trial next month, that didn’t stop LeGrand from posting bail, relocating, and attempting an even grander undertaking in Las Vegas. From the beginning, the advanced technology seemed to promise lofty sustainability goals. Such goals included creating tech that would make its “own off-the-grid energy” powered by the sun, wind, and even footsteps; “supertrees” that would support a 95-percent reduction in water consumption; as well as entire building facades functioning as solar panels.

Tom Letizia, a spokesperson for Bleutech, told Commercial Property Executive, “We hope to inspire other developers to commit to sustainability in a whole new way for our future and to put benefits ahead of costs.” Over email correspondence, Letizia delivered a statement to AN from LeGrand: “The Miami Herald story was a total misrepresentation. I have complete faith in our judicial system and I have total confidence that justice will prevail with this case.”

Bleutech’s key technology partners—Cisco, Knightscope, Pavegen, and Onyx Solar, all reputable companies with tangible products—demonstrated their respective contributions at an event held in Las Vegas on August 28, where the project designer, KME Architects, also presented a batch of new renderings. The aforementioned tech partners, as well as the general contractor, Martin-Harris Construction, expressed excitement in moving forward with the plans on time. Guy Martin, president of Martin-Harris, declined AN’s request to comment on the current situation. KME could not be reached for comment at the time of writing, and AN will update this article accordingly if they respond. It remains to be seen whether the project will be completed as originally scheduled.",[]
https://www.we-heart.com/2019/03/14/las-vegas-city-guide-art-culture/,['Las Vegas'],Las Vegas City Guide: How art and culture is changing the face of Sin City,"Ask any star of popular culture who’s endured their ‘moment of shame’: reputations are hard to shake. Cities, though, are usually many things to many people. A cornucopia of diversity from gritty emerging neighbourhoods with artist-led gentrification to glitzy districts renowned for haute couture or gastronomy. Barcelona may have a reputation for pickpocketing, but its embarrassment of cultural riches, its beaches and balmy weather, soon put petty criminals to the back of the mind.

The ‘entertainment capital of the world’ is different. What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. Its reputation stays longer. Stag parties to high rollers, eloping lovebirds to drunken partygoers, it’s the city that feels like an eternal festival, and one easily pigeonholed by anyone the slightest familiar with Sin City. Slots, poker and debauchery; bright lights to scorching sun; sleepless nights; and fat Elvis.

If cities were people, Las Vegas would be the archetypical rock and roll bad boy. The tabloids and the tears. It is brilliant and beguiling, inimitable and irresistible, but it is a city of one dimension. One reputation. Isn’t it?

In 1972, Yale architecture tutors Denise Scott Brown and Robert Venturi—alongside teaching assistant and co-author, Steven Izenour—would shake the architectural world to its foundations with their groundbreaking publication, Learning From Las Vegas: the Forgotten Symbolism of Architectural Form. Boldly bumping heads with modernism, it would serve as a sort of blueprint for the no-holds-barred style of postmodernist design that has enjoyed a renaissance of late. Whisking 13 Yale students out to the Mojave Desert for a 12-week excursion, the progressive thinkers would document the wild and wonderful kitsch that was the Strip at the time.

Often seen as the exact opposite of what studious architects would create, Vegas offered inspiration for a new generation tired of the constraints of modernist design. Much of what was documented in the book has since disappeared, but the essence they discovered endures. “What will happen to the Strip when the tastemakers take over,” they wrote. Nearly 50 years later, it’s clear they needn’t have worried. ‘Miami Moroccan’, ‘Bauhaus Hawaiian’ and ‘Hollywood Orgasmic’ were some of the ‘styles’ they noted on their trip, and Las Vegas is as off the wall today as ever. Could they have imagined a vast replica of Venice, complete with canals and gondolas? A 541-foot recreation of Paris’s Eiffel Tower?

Whilst Las Vegas might serve as a filterless vision of childlike architecture, a ‘what if we let teenagers loose on urban planning’ for poker players and partygoers, the arrival in 2009 of MGM’s CityCenter hinted at a distinct shift in long-standing traditions of bad taste. A vast $10 billion complex of almost 17 million square feet, shy it is not, but it harnesses what has become known as ‘the Bilbao effect’; on account of Frank Gehry’s monumental Guggenheim museum transforming the fortunes of the once-gritty Spanish city. Here in Nevada, the development called upon starchitects such as Daniel Libeskind and Norman Foster, its leisure and retail spaces bringing more to the city than more expansive nuos.

As well as big-hitting architecture, you’ll also find public artworks from names like Jenny Holzer, Henry Moore, and Claes Oldenburg—the Aria Fine Art Collection a treasure trove of contemporary art spread across an outdoor campus. Having all but dropped the CityCenter branding in favour of Aria, the development’s centrepiece property, the concept remains the same. Connecting adjacent MGM properties Park MGM and the Bellagio by the Aria Express tram system, the project gives the Strip the ‘centre’ it was always missing, bringing a kind of order to the urban planning chaos that Scott Brown and Venturi found.

Over at the hotel known by its dancing fountains, you’ll find more culture in the shape of the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art, which is currently hosting Aftermath of Obliteration of Eternity, one of Yayoi Kusama’s iconic Infinity Mirrored Rooms, alongside Narcissus Garden, an installation by the Japanese visionary that has been reinstalled in various settings since its conception more than 50 years ago.

On the other side of CityCenter, Park MGM offers another alternative vision of Sin City. A partnership between Sydell Group and MGM Resorts International, the resort—formerly the Monte Carlo Resort and Casino—is a social hub that brings the urbanity one might associate with New York or London to Vegas. The top floors deliver ‘boutique’ to the city, with the group’s noted NoMad hotel arriving with subtle decadence. Informed by the grandeur of old-world European casinos, NoMad Casino is a refined space to play roulette, blackjack or poker underneath a Tiffany glass ceiling, craft cocktails heightening your confidence as the Rat Pack spirit returns and Vegas’s glory days are recalled.

Chef Daniel Humm and restaurateur Will Guidara of New York’s lauded three Michelin-starred Eleven Madison Park have created the restaurant and bar concept at NoMad; the Martin Brudnizki-designed Primrose takes its cues from 1950s South of France; and gourmet food truck pioneer Roy Choi brings mouthwatering casual dining to the resort in the shape of his Korean BBQ joint, Best Friend. It’s not only about the style at Park MGM, there is plenty of substance to back it up.

With art and culture, fine dining and European flair, changing perceptions of Las Vegas around the infamous Strip, changes are abound in downtown too. A resident of the city, serial internet entrepreneur Tony Hsieh has ploughed huge amounts of money into developing the part of the city often left behind by the frenetic growth of the mega-resorts; most notably into The Las Vegas Arts District, an emerging neighbourhood gentrified in a bid to encourage artists to flock to the city, and the fabrication of businesses owned by locals as opposed to large corporations. Those looking for a side of culture for their weekend of gambling and debauchery today have more than the four miles of Strip to look past.

The Arts District, or the 18b (on account of it occupying 18 blocks of Downtown Las Vegas), is growing in popularity for its monthly block party and art walk, ‘First Friday’, which has seen food trucks and live music serving as a backdrop for artists showing their works off at a variety of open air and indoor galleries including The Arts Factory and ArtSquare; a hip establishment that’s home to design stores, designers studios, wellness spots, and food and drink outlets. Debuting in 2013, Life Is Beautiful is a music and arts festival that transforms 18b, leaving a lasting legacy in the form of murals from the international street art elite.

The festival’s ongoing collaboration with arts house Justkids this year saw creatives including André Saraiva, RETNA, and Egle Zvirblyte beautifying the 18 blocks—with previous years hosting the likes of D*Face, Shepard Fairey, and Banksy. Acts such as Arcade Fire, Florence + The Machine, The xx, and Justice have kept the music flowing, whilst the culinary lineup sees more than 70 local and regional restaurants and bars, noted chefs and mixologists, food trucks and fine dining experiences. Comedians and talks from passionate internationally-renowned thought leaders complete the exhaustive Life Is Beautiful experience.

With its distinct bohemian vibe, downtown is also home to Freemont Street—the ‘original’ Vegas, home to classic and pleasingly worn casinos like the handsome Golden Nugget. A far cry from the mammoth gaming experiences that surround the Strip, but its old-fashioned charm has seen it become a firm favourite with players, and it hosts one of the best poker tournaments in Vegas—the gleefully garish bright-lights chaos of the Freemont Street Experience surrounding it, the Nugget and neighbouring casinos offer an unexpected slice of apple pie Americana.

With its kitsch neon, 1,500 ft canopy complete with ‘Viva Vision’ screen made up of 12.5 million LEDs, and slot-inspired zip line, there’s much of the mania that ignited the fire inside the Yale architecture students here, but for the complete experience one must head a little less than a mile north, where one of the world’s most unconventional museums awaits.

Worth suffering the stifling desert heat for, the one-of-a-kind Neon Museum is dedicated to saving and preserving vintage neon signs, the 1996-founded partnership between the Allied Arts Council of Southern Nevada and the City of Las Vegas today an independent non-profit organisation located on Las Vegas Boulevard and Bonanza, exhibiting iconic signs restored to glory as the flux of the Strip has cast them aside. An unconventional museum in two parts, the defunct and decommissioned signs of Las Vegas now make their way to the Neon Boneyard—looking more like a scrapyard for crapped-out motors minus the usual pair of mongrels on a chainlink leash keeping out the skiprats.

Take a walk through a dilapidated but fascinating collection of signs dating back to the 1930s, marvel at the former lobby of the La Concha Motel, designed in the early 1960s by Paul William Revere, restored and transplanted to the museum as its unorthodox visitors centre. It’s a reminder of the speed at which the cultural landscape shifts here; while high-rollers may be concerned with how not to bankrupt in Las Vegas casinos, here you can witness a rare fragility of the casinos themselves. Nothing is sacred in Sin City. As is the case with everything here, the Neon Museum delivers big for those curious of counterculture, and affirms that the city’s reputation is one shifting with time.

Overseen by a 40-foot-tall fire-breathing praying mantis—originally built for the Burning Man festival and capable of shooting flames six storeys high—the Downtown Container Park houses a selection off offbeat shops, restaurants, bars, and The Dome; an immersive 4K-visual entertainment experience that cocoons viewers with 14 million pixels in a series of ultra-HD, 360-degree imagery. Opening the same year Life Is Beautiful debuted, the open-air culture and retail centre is as close to intimate as you’ll find in Las Vegas, and a project with community at its core. It is also a lasting example of the impact culture has had on this part of the city—how Tony Hsieh’s art-led vision for a downtown revival may manifest itself over time.

With grassroots art and culture shifting the landscape of Las Vegas’s downtown, Park MGM reigniting the grandeur and glamour of old, and monumental architecture projects occupied by big-name contemporary art, changes are underfoot here in Sin City. Reviews of online casinos show that everything from security and trust to graphics and customer service are at an all-time high, it’s natural that the world’s most famous gambling capital needs shift its position.

The ‘tastemakers’ may not have taken over just yet, for it is still as bafflingly offbeat and idiosyncratic as ever, but the influence of hip neighbourhoods from London to Los Angeles has seeped in. Neon and kitsch remain in the ‘entertainment capital of the world’, poker and profligacy persist, but counterculture is guiding Las Vegas in a new and surprising direction. One dimensional? No chance.",[]

""The lifeblood of smart cities is connectivity, just as it is for smart hospitals, smart banks, and other IoT-dependent industries.""

A recently announced $7.5 billion real-estate project in Las Vegas, NV will offer renewable energy sources, autonomous vehicles, and augmented reality, among other high-tech features. The privately funded “mini-city” will include residential, office, and retail space, along with hotel and entertainment facilities.[1]. “Over 50 percent of the world’s population already lives in cities,” says Choice Business Connections CEO Darren Sadana, “and it’s projected that 68 percent will be urbanized by 2050[2].” Sadana, whose company specializes in wireless connectivity for IoT and solution providers, adds, “Given this pattern and current technological capabilities, we can expect to see more ‘smart cities’ begin to emerge in the near future.”

Bleutech Park Las Vegas is scheduled to break ground in December 2019—it is expected to take six years to build out. Within the complex, said by its developer to be the first of its kind in the world, flooring will capture and reuse the energy of human movement. Photovoltaic glass will be standard in all structures, turning building exteriors into solar panels and enabling the resources needed for heating, cooling, lighting, and electricity to be generated onsite. Security will be provided robotically via biometrics and other techniques[3].

The project, says Sadana, provides a striking example of the extent to which IoT technology has come to impact mainstream companies, ordinary consumers, and the world marketplace; the global IoT market is expected to be more than $3 trillion annually by 2026[4]. A key component of this growth, according to industry observers, will be fifth-generation (5G) cellular telephone technology, which is not expected to be widely available in the U.S. until 2020[5].

The true infrastructure of tomorrow’s smart cities, Sadana notes, consists of thousands of IoT-based applications and solutions. Ideally, these solutions, created by individual software developers, combine into the constant flow of information that enables a connected community to function. Going forward, developers will need to work closely both with governmental entities and the private sector to ensure that business and community priorities are being met[6].

“The lifeblood of smart cities,” says Sadana, “is connectivity, just as it is for smart hospitals, smart banks, and other IoT-dependent industries. It is also the lifeblood of solution providers. In managing their businesses and planning expansion, these companies should be aware that connectivity needs can fluctuate, and that it is possible to obtain accurate, current information—including pricing and contract requirements—about this essential commodity.”

The Las Vegas City Council on Monday approved a $616 million general fund spending plan for the coming fiscal year that accomplishes two key goals: It funds dozens of new public safety positions while staving off a structural deficit.

The final budget also keeps intact a $5 million surplus projected during a review of the tentative plan in April.

It will be used to fully fund a third wave of hiring for city marshals, staff 13 positions at Fire Station 103, hire eight administrators in the Department of Public Safety and provide the city’s share of 62 new Metropolitan Police Department employees, including 40 police officers.

Metro’s request for staffing, which the city shares with Clark County, fell by $2.7 million since last month, enabling the city to contribute more money to capital improvement projects, according to Chief Financial Officer Gary Ameling.

Despite attention to public safety, the spending plan does not fund initiatives for homelessness, the council’s other high-priority issue, leaving officials to continue searching for money elsewhere.

Ameling estimated the city would spend $35 million on homelessness for fiscal year 2020, excluding capital funds, but less than 10 percent of it is expected to be directed toward outreach. Much of the cost is associated with law enforcement, fire services and the court system, according to Monday’s presentation to the council.

Councilman Bob Coffin pointed to the failure this legislative session of a city-sponsored bill to generate new funding for fighting homelessness through a sewer surcharge and real estate transfer taxes. The bill was later amended to create a working group to address homelessness instead.

“They didn’t listen to us in Carson City,” Coffin said. “They gave us the cold shoulder.”

While the city’s final budget also showed healthy $20 million-plus reserves, it also revealed that more work needs to be done to beat back the likelihood of sinking into deficit spending by as early as fiscal year 2022.

City expenses are growing at 4.1 percent, outpacing the 3.5 percent revenue growth, meaning that the practice of freezing non-critical jobs to save money is expected to continue. Las Vegas has left 82 positions unfilled to save $8 million thus far, but the goal is to save $10 million, Ameling said.

Adding to the caution, the city’s reliance on property tax and consolidated tax revenues, including sales tax, is particularly precarious in the event of a likely economic slowdown because both sources are sensitive to fluctuations.

Still, both tax streams continue to fare well, projected to rise by 5.8 and 5 percent, respectively, in the coming fiscal year.

“It’s a very exciting time,” Ameling said of the city’s booming economic development. “But we’re keeping an eye on it because we’re not quite sure how it’s going to play out.”

One hundred miles of bicycle lanes extended throughout Las Vegas 10 years ago. Today, there are about 500 miles citywide and an additional 200 miles in other parts of the Valley.

Car culture, funding restrictions on cycling infrastructure and the sprawling nature of the Valley have historically created challenges for urban cycling. But as Southern Nevada grows in population and road biking becomes more normalized, the region’s cities and Clark County are adopting more bike-friendly policies and infrastructure, albeit incrementally.

“We’re building it little by little,” said Marco Velotta, a senior management analyst in the City of Las Vegas’ Planning Department.

The efforts seem to be bringing more cyclists out of the shadows. The number of people carrying bicycles onto Regional Transportation Commission buses has been steadily increasing in the past several years, RTC data shows. In May, the agency counted about 56,000 bicycles on buses, and officials continue to observe “well-utilized” bike racks around the Las Vegas Strip, said Ron Floth, bicycle and community outreach coordinator for the RTC.

Cyclists range from children biking to school (particularly in more residential, higher-income neighborhoods) to millennials to aging baby boomers, Floth said. Some cycle primarily to commute, others for leisure and exercise, and others because bicycles are their primary or most reliable form of transportation.

“People [are] riding from transit to their final destination, which is work. We’re seeing quite a bit of that,” Floth said.

Within the city limits, affluent Summerlin seems to have the largest biking population and the most bike lanes, some of which were created by the Howard Hughes Corporation that owns and manages the master-planned community, according to Velotta. Also-affluent Henderson is similarly known for its high concentration of bike lanes and bike paths.

A major goal in the region now is to make biking as equitable as possible, in part by expanding bike infrastructure into all neighborhoods and communities.

“It’s one thing to make sure an area like Summerlin has facilities, and that’s important, but we want to make sure we hit places like Downtown and Wards 1, 3 and 5 in the center of the city,” Velotta said.

Changing the culture

Despite a growth in bike infrastructure and bike riders, cyclists and planners acknowledge that the region has a long way to go to protect cyclists and instill a share-the-road mentality throughout the Valley, especially among drivers.

“We still need to do more on the encouragement part and the enforcement part,” Velotta said.

Cyclist injuries and fatalities at the hands of drivers remain common; four cyclists have been killed so far this year in Clark County, according to the Nevada Office of Traffic Safety.

To reduce fatalities and collisions, many cyclists would like to see stronger enforcement of a Nevada law requiring drivers to maintain a three-foot distance from cyclists when passing them on the road. Although the three-foot law has been in place for years, drivers who hit cyclists (and therefore have automatically broken the law) still often get off scot-free, said Heather Fisher, president of the Summerlin-based bike shop Las Vegas Cyclery.

Many drivers don’t even know that the law exists, and lax enforcement doesn’t help, Fisher added.

“It just needs to be promoted through the DMV, through signage, or anywhere we can get the word out,” she said.

Fisher has lived and biked in the Valley since 1992 and now lives in Blue Diamond, a more rural and potentially safer enclave for cyclists compared with heavily trafficked areas such as Downtown Las Vegas.

Downtown, for its part, has some of the strongest cycling infrastructure in the area, including highlighted green bike lanes and access to the RTC’s bike center and bike share program. But cyclists often agree that it is still one of the most hostile areas, mostly because of the amount of vehicular traffic it gets.

“When you get into some of the more high-traffic areas closer to Downtown, people seem to be less [bike]-friendly. People are in a hurry, and maybe they don’t expect [cyclists] there,” said biker and North Las Vegas resident Mary Margaret Williams.

It’s a problem no longer unique to Downtown, as population and traffic continue to rise rapidly. Even though there are more cyclists on the road than there were 10 years ago, there are also more drivers, many of whom are more distracted than ever before, said biker Sean Tyrone.

“There are … more close calls, more accidents and more deaths, and 99% of them are because of driver inattention,” said Tyrone, who is also chief operating officer of Las Vegas Cyclery.

Tyrone used to commute for years from east Las Vegas to Green Valley. That bike route is a lot more problematic today, he said.

“I had a lot of close calls [before], but nothing like what I’ve seen and experienced personally in the last five years,” he said.

That’s not to say that growth cannot be accomplished in a way that helps cyclists, Fisher noted. For example, the Southern Nevada Regional Bicycle Coalition is pushing for developers to start including bike lanes whenever they build new housing. The City of Las Vegas’ 2050 Master Plan will also include a greater emphasis on multimodal transit, including cycling.

Funding for cycling infrastructure has always been a challenge when it comes to getting more bike lanes onto the streets. The Las Vegas Planning Department’s budget for bicycle infrastructure is still a tiny fraction of the rest of the budget, but it is becoming more of a priority, Velotta said. Other departments—such as Public Works, Parks and Recreation, and Operations and Maintenance—are also beginning to embrace cycling-friendly policies, he said.

“The fact that we’re including more and more buffer lanes, and that is now kind of the default, it just shows that there’s more of a commitment there to making complete streets possible,” Velotta said.

Pouring money into the issue isn’t a guarantee the region will become more bike-friendly, but if the money goes toward installing cycling infrastructure and signs, it can at least help drivers prepare to see cyclists and understand how to interact with them, Williams said. She acknowledged that cyclists must understand how to interact with drivers safely as well, something the RTC has been promoting through bike safety programs and educational workshops.

As a cyclist, the key to safety is to stay with traffic, utilize hand signals and use a bike light at night, which is required under Nevada law, Floth said. Although biking on sidewalks is permitted in most of Clark County with the exception of North Las Vegas, cyclists are safer when they act like motor vehicles and go with the flow, Floth emphasized.

“One of the things we talk to cyclists about all the time is to ride predictably,” he added. “That way, motorists know what they’re going to do.”

In the coming years, Fisher hopes that the region will recognize not only the health, environmental and recreational benefits of cycling, but also how becoming a cycling city could propel Las Vegas into the future.

“You go to other cities and there’s bike lanes everywhere and bike paths everywhere,” Fisher said. “They do that to attract the newer, younger tech-y job market to their cities, and to diversify. And that’s what we’re going to have to do here.”

Planners seem to have a similar vision.

“We’ve come considerably far over the past decade,” Velotta said. “We really have seen a physical transformation as a result. But we still have a lot of work to do.”

https://www.oregonlive.com/news/2019/08/northwest-portland-homeless-navigation-center-opens-in-lauded-public-private-partnership.html,['Portland'],Northwest Portland homeless ‘navigation center’ opens in lauded public-private partnership,"A homeless shelter funded in part by private sector donations opened Monday as part of a summer push to remake Portland’s shelter system.

The Harbor of Hope River District Navigation Center was the brainchild of developer Homer Williams. He raised about $3 million from Columbia Sportswear CEO Tim Boyle and other private donations to cover the $3.5 million construction costs for the giant tent-like structure.

“We have in our city a humanitarian crisis,” Williams said at the unveiling. “Today, this is a step on a very, very long journey.”

The shelter can serve up to 100 people at a time and will be open all hours, all days. Nonprofit Transition Projects will operate the shelter. People interested in staying there must make reservations through Transition Projects.

Several officials praised the shelter as an example of a successful public-private partnership, with Mayor Ted Wheeler calling it “one of the most ambitious” to date to combat the growing homeless population.

However, it wasn’t originally envisioned to be a partnership.

Williams, and his nonprofit Harbor of Hope, initially promised that the shelter and its services would be entirely paid by the private sector.

Harbor of Hope broke ground last April on land donated by Portland’s urban renewal agency, which will retain ownership of the land. The city waived permit fees.

By the time Williams raised the $3.5 million estimated to complete the project, the cost had doubled.

The Joint Office of Homeless Services, which is funded by both the city and county, agreed to contribute the first year’s operating budget, which will pay for staff, programming and day-to-day needs at the shelter. Officials estimate that to cost at least $1 million.

The “navigation center” model is an adaptation of what San Francisco and other cities have done. It combines traditional shelter space with intensive help from service providers to help the people who stay at the shelter get into permanent housing as quickly as possible. It also has laundry facilities, showers and other amenities.

By the time it opened Monday, the idea is less novel than when proposed. This summer, the Joint Office unveiled the Laurelwood Center, which will house up to 120 women and couples, as well as provide on-site social services.

Officials noted Monday that the new openings and restructuring of the shelter system is intended to bring more spaces in line with that model.

Earlier this summer, Lilac Meadows, a 40-room family shelter on Southeast Powell Boulevard, opened in a former motel. Twenty-six more family shelter beds will open later this year in a Portland Homeless Family Solutions-run shelter in Lents.

PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — Portland police are mobilizing to prevent clashes between out-of-state far-right groups planning a rally here and the homegrown anti-fascists who oppose them as America's culture wars seep into this progressive haven.

Saturday's rally — and the violence it may bring — are a relatively new reality here, as an informal coalition of white nationalists, white supremacists and extreme-right militias hones its focus on Oregon's largest city as a stand-in for everything it feels is wrong with the U.S. At the top of that list are the masked and black-clad anti-fascists who turn out to violently oppose right-wing demonstrators as soon as they set foot in town.

""It's Portlandia, and in the public mind it represents everything these (far-right) groups are against,"" said Heidi Beirich, director of the Intelligence Project at the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups. ""It's progressive, and even more offensive to them, it's progressive white people who should be on these guys' side.""

The groups know they will get a headline-grabbing reaction from Portland's so-called ""antifa,"" whose members have issued an online call to their followers to turn out to ""defend Portland from a far-Right attack."" Portland's Rose City Antifa, the nation's oldest active anti-fascist group, says violence against right-wing demonstrators is ""exactly what should happen when the far-right attempts to invade our town.""

Portland leaders are planning a major law enforcement presence on the heels of similar rallies in June and last summer that turned violent, and the recent hate-driven shooting in El Paso, Texas. None of the city's nearly 1,000 police officers will have the day off, and Portland will get help from the Oregon State Police and the FBI. Mayor Ted Wheeler has said he may ask Gov. Kate Brown, a Democrat, to call up the Oregon National Guard.

""There's no winning for the cops in a situation like this. There just isn't,"" Beirich said. ""This is hard-core stuff, and I don't think you can be too cautious.""

Experts who track right-wing militias and hate groups warn that the mix of people heading to Portland also came together for a Unite the Right rally in 2017 in Charlottesville, Virginia, which ended when a participant rammed his car into a crowd of counterprotesters, killing one person and injuring 19.

The rally is being organized by a member of the Proud Boys, who have been designated by the Southern Poverty Law Center as a hate group. Others expected include members of the American Guard, the Three Percenters, the Oathkeepers and the Daily Stormers. American Guard is a white nationalist group, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, while the Three Percenters and the Oathkeepers are extremist anti-government militias. The Daily Stormers are neo-Nazis, according to the center.

Portland's fraught history with hate groups adds to the complex dynamic.

Many of today's anti-fascists trace their activist heritage to a group that battled with neo-Nazis in Portland's streets decades ago, and they feel this is the same struggle in a new era, said Randy Blazak, the leading expert on the history of hate groups in Oregon.

White supremacists murdered an Ethiopian man, Mulugeta Seraw, in Portland in 1988. And by the 1990s, Portland was known as Skinhead City because it was the home base of Volksfront, at the time one of the most active neo-Nazi groups in the U.S. As recently as 2007, neo-Nazis attempted to gather in Portland for a three-day skinhead festival.

""When I'm looking at what's happening right now, for me it's a direct line back to the 1980s: the battles between the racist skinheads and the anti-racist skinheads,"" Blazak said. ""It's the latest version of this thing that's been going on for 30 years in this city.""

Police, meanwhile, have seemed overwhelmed by the cultural forces at war in their streets.

At the June rally, masked antifa members beat up a conservative blogger named Andy Ngo. Video of the 30-second attack grabbed national attention and further turned the focus on Portland as a new battleground in a divisive America.

Republican Sens. Ted Cruz, of Texas, and Bill Cassidy, of Louisiana, introduced a congressional resolution calling for anti-fascists to be declared domestic terrorists, and President Donald Trump echoed that theme in a tweet last month. Portland's City Hall has been evacuated twice due to bomb threats after the June 29 skirmishes, and Wheeler, the mayor, has been pilloried by critics who incorrectly said he told police to stand down while anti-fascists went after right-wing demonstrators.

""I don't want for one minute anyone to think that because we're being thrust into this political show, that I or the public have lost confidence in (police officers') ability to do what we do,"" said Police Chief Danielle Outlaw, who is regularly heckled as she leaves City Hall by those who feel the police target counterprotesters for arrest over far-right demonstrators.

Police have noted the violence in June was limited to a small area of downtown Portland despite three different demonstrations that lasted more than five hours, with hundreds of people constantly on the move. They also made two arrests last week in a May Day assault on an antifa member that became a rallying cry for the city's far-left.

""We'll be ready for the 17th here in little Portland, Oregon,"" Wheeler, the mayor, told The Associated Press. ""But at the end of the day, the bigger question is about our nation's moral compass and which direction it's pointing.""

Blazak, the Oregon hate groups expert, said he worries the extreme response from a small group of counterprotesters is starting to backfire. Many in the city oppose the right-wing rallies but also dislike the violent response of antifa, which provides social media fodder for the far-right.

""The opposition is playing right into the alt-right's hands by engaging with them this way,"" he said.

Joe Biggs, organizer of Saturday's rally, said the attack on Ngo made him decide to hold the event with the goal of getting antifa declared a domestic terrorist organization. Biggs said those coming to Portland have been told not to bring weapons or start fights, but they will defend themselves if attacked.

Biggs toned down his online rhetoric after the El Paso shootings and urged followers coming to Portland to keep a cool head. He says he is not racist — he has a toddler daughter with his Guyanese wife — but wants to show the world antifa's violent tactics.

""That group of antifa there in Portland needs to be exposed for who they are,"" Biggs said in a phone interview with The Associated Press. ""And guess what? They should be scared.""

Everyday Portlanders, however, are feeling more frustrated than scared by the protests that bring their city to a standstill. A 5K race scheduled for Saturday along the waterfront was moved at the last minute to avoid any violence, and an Irish bar that's a city institution canceled an amateur boxing event that draws 500 spectators. Other businesses plan to close on one of the last weekends of the city's peak tourist season.

""People are nervous, people are hesitant to go anywhere near that area, and I don't blame them,"" said Aaron Montaglione, owner of Terrapin Events, which is putting on the 5K race. ""It's affecting everyone.""

Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler addresses misperceptions about Portland during news conference.

Portland played host to more than 200 protests and political demonstrations last year, but only a small fraction turned violent.

That's according to Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler, speaking during a 30-minute press conference on Monday, July 8. They were his first public remarks since a slew of three local rallies devolved into ugly street fighting on June 29, grabbing international attention.

Noting the ""global shellacking"" and deluge of death threats sent to his office, the mayor pushed back against what he deemed a misinformation campaign circulating about the Rose City.

""I want to address the perception that Portland is somehow a lawless city,"" Wheeler said. ""People who live here, people who know Portland, know that is simply not true.""

He then laid some of the blame on the president of the Portland Police Association, Daryl Turner, who sent out a July 1 news release calling on Wheeler to ""remove the handcuffs from our officers."" The claim was widely repeated online, and was sometimes attributed directly to the Portland Police Bureau, rather than the rank-and-file union Turner represents.

""He crossed a line,"" Wheeler said of Turner.

Saying he wants lots of options on the table, Wheeler declined to explicitly endorse the proposal floated on July 3 by Police Chief Danielle Outlaw, who called for a law making it illegal to wear a mask while committing crimes. Outlaw also suggested changes to a law that prevents authorities from filming a political rally unless a crime is occurring.

Instead, Wheeler announced plans to seek input from business leaders, civil rights advocates and the community at large as he mulls new strategies to address protest violence, which he said was less prevalent now than when he took office two-and-a-half years ago.

""I don't believe Chief Outlaw and I are in a position to singularly or independently resolve this question without the community,"" Wheeler said.

The Portland Police Bureau is preparing an after-action report regarding the June 29 demonstration that should be completed within 10 days. Wheeler said he held a ""brainstorming"" session with Billy J. Williams, the U.S. attorney for the District of Oregon, as well.

The mayor and his advisers may not have much time to implement new ideas, whatever they may be. The right-wing Proud Boys already have set the date for their next demonstration here on Saturday, Aug. 17 — an event sure to draw a swarm of counter-protesters.

But here's one idea that won't be revisited: Wheeler's protest safety ordinance, which was voted down by the City Council 3-2 last year. Wheeler says the votes haven't changed.

Commissioner Chloe Eudaly, one of the no votes, sat silently in the audience during much of the press conference.

https://www.eater.com/2019/7/23/20707114/portland-food-carts-disappearing-development-boom,['Portland'],Can Portland’s Food Carts Survive the City’s Development Boom?,"This story was originally published on Civil Eats.

In early July, construction began on the Pacific Northwest’s first Ritz-Carlton hotel in downtown Portland, Oregon. The 35-story tower project, which will also include offices and condominiums, is testament to the rapid growth the city has experienced in recent years. It also embodies the cultural shift sweeping through this once blue-collar town. A street- level food hall will be built where some 40 food carts stood only weeks earlier.

When the property manager, City Center Parking, announced that it was evicting the food carts in Portland’s largest, oldest, and most iconic street food epicenter, giving owners just 30 days to move out, city officials scrambled to find the businesses a new home. Cart owners and their employees — said to be at least 200 people strong — organized and community leaders rallied around them. After weeks of proposed temporary solutions, the city has finally found space for the carts and the businesses will be back up and running soon.

But this happy ending follows a very tense and trying few months that should serve as a cautionary tale for any city undergoing an influx of new residents and business investments, where lower-income, immigrant, and other vulnerable populations are displaced by successive waves of people attracted to the very culture those populations helped create.

“These food carts sprung up in a bad economy so that the lot owners could get an additional revenue stream,” said Keith M. Jones of Friends of the Green Loop, a public space advocate who worked closely with cart owners and city officials through the eviction and relocation process. “Now land is at a premium, so these lots are going to start disappearing and getting developed. The future of food carts in Portland is grim.”

Portland has decided that food carts — which, unlike food trucks, are immobile unless towed — are an indelible part of the city’s culture, but the saga of relocating more than three dozen businesses on short notice, and working with a largely immigrant community who speak many languages, suggests that cities would benefit from planning ahead to decide which cherished institutions will be ushered through change, and how that will happen.

“[The city] is trying to save the food carts,” says cart owner Richard Tran. “The tourists come here and they look for the food carts.”

A brief history of the pod

The Alder Street food cart pod began when a few culinary upstarts began renting space along the edges of a downtown parking lot in the 1990s. Over the years, their numbers grew, encircling parked cars and enticing passing office workers with the smells of curries, tacos, kebabs, stir-fry, and pizza. The model spread to other downtown lots, then beyond the urban core, and eventually to other cities.

In a state where roughly 10 percent of all residents are foreign-born, and over 12 percent have at least one immigrant parent, food carts play an important role in helping new citizens forge autonomous futures. “Food carts have become a part of the DNA of Portland, not to mention our tourism industry and local economy,” said city Commissioner Chloe Eudaly in a statement on the Gofundme page Jones set up to help fund the transition. “Many of the Alder Street carts are owned by immigrants and people of color, and as we continue to face an affordability crisis, we have to start addressing the displacement of small businesses as well as residents.”

Portland has become a popular tourist destination in no small part because of its food cart pods — functionally permanent installations of individual eateries that are more affordable to open and operate than a standard brick-and-mortar restaurant. But that popularity also drove up real estate prices.

A shuffling of priorities

In October 2018, developers cleared a smaller food cart pod directly across from Alder Street to make way for a Marriott Moxy hotel, inspiring a coalition of foodies and urban design activists to propose a development-proof plan for housing carts on city streets. Talk of a “ culinary corridor” faded quickly from the news, but it has this year resurfaced with a vengeance.

Paperwork for the Ritz-Carlton development was filed in 2018, and some cart owners began moving to other pods when they heard. Others sold their carts in situ to aspiring chefs who were either unaware of the hotel, or brazen enough, to risk investing in prime street food real estate in hopes of establishing themselves in the time that remained.

Lei (who goes by one name) is a good example. He left the military and spent $20,000 to open Eggy Pocket in September 2018, a month after his parents came to the U.S. on short notice. “They worked for restaurants in China,” he said. “After they came here, they don’t speak English, so the food truck is small investment and we can make some money — slowly. But it works pretty good.”

Food carts run on tight margins, however, making it difficult for most owners to save up for unexpected expenses or gaps in income. In the last days before eviction, while his parents served customers their popular crêpe-like bings, Lei worried over their future, as well as his wife and one-year-old. Eggy Pocket supported everyone.

The family plans to spend the next few months looking for a new spot downtown. “If nothing comes up then we’ll take the next step, probably find a job or sell the food truck,” he said.

Although intentions for the tower construction were public, the project’s timeline remained vague until recently. Several cart owners and those helping with their relocation have accused the lot’s management company, City Center Parking, of keeping the information from them in order to continue collecting rent for as long as possible, but the company did not respond to requests for comment from Civil Eats.

There are 37 other food cart pods listed throughout Portland, but with more than 500 carts operating at any given time space has become rarified and rents are climbing—particularly downtown.

Sarhan, who also goes by one name, has located his business, Noah Halal, on a corner of Alder Street for the past six years. He found a new location for his cart four blocks away in a nearby pod, although he is worried about how the new spot would impact his late-night business. “I have two uncles that own food trucks [in Portland]; they’ve been there longer than we have, so we know a lot of people,” he said.

The cart owners who hadn’t secured a future home careened toward the end of June without a plan to haul their carts off the property or anywhere to take them.

Chef Sam Mouzon has been running carts at Alder Street for the past several years, and opened a barbecue cart two years ago. He accepted an invitation to move his cart across town, behind a martial arts studio where another cart is current parked. The change suits his eventual desire to open a brick-and-mortar restaurant, but he worries about his neighbors, especially those who are new to the U.S.

For established citizens like Mouzon, securing loans, dealing with tow-truck companies, and signing new leases isn’t likely to be as difficult as it is for many of his neighbors. “It’s not exactly easy for several of the food cart owners here,” he said. “For a lot of them, it was a challenge just to get into [the Alder Steer pod].”

A temporary site is proposed

Keith Jones and the Portland Bureau of Transportation officials began meeting regularly with owners at Alder Street in the wake of the eviction notice. On June 24, exactly one week before the lot was vacated, the city announced a proposal to relocate 37 carts to a nearby city park through the end of the tourist season.

But this temporary site would not be ready in a week’s time. Money was needed. Permits were needed. Water and electrical hookups would need to be installed. The neighbors would have to agree.

Unlike food truck owners, food cart owners cannot simply drive their businesses off the lot and park in a driveway until a new pod opens. Thirty-some carts in various states of disrepair would need to be relocated multiple times. All of it would cost money, and at a time when cart owners were facing a gap in revenue.

Boping Wong, originally from Guangzhou, China, opened Asian Fusion Bowl in 2017 after years of working in Portland restaurants. When she spoke with Civil Eats in late June, she had heard about the temporary site idea, but had no confirmation that she would be allowed to park there and no plan to move her cart. Wong thought that it would be in the city’s best interest to help owners relocate to keep everyone off the unemployment rolls and food stamps.

“We live month to month, paycheck to paycheck,” said Mouzon. “No one’s getting rich out here. You can make a living, but the labor costs are going up. [Our customers don’t] want to pay more; everybody likes carts because it’s cheap food.”

There’s never a good time for a small business owner to have to close shop, but for the food carts in a city with long, rainy winters, summer offers an opportunity to make up the difference.

“These are the most important months for us. July is double the income of October, ” said Khalid Saad, who emigrated from Baghdad in 2008 and opened his first cart soon after. In its current location, Baghdad Iraqi Grill has been serving downtown workers and visitors mesquite chicken shawarma for four years. Alder Street’s legendary status and proximity to Portland’s hotels brings in a booming tourist trade over the summer.

Saad said he liked the location of the proposed nearby temporary site because his regular customers would still be able to find him. “I’ve been in downtown for nine years, I don’t want to move out,” he said.

The clock winds down

Anxious but hopeful, owners and their employees kept serving customers. But as time passed without any official word, rumors filled the void, as did a polyglot game of telephone. Many people held onto faith that the city would come through with a solution—some had heard that the city was paying to tow everyone to new locations.

“So far, I don’t have any information,” said Ling Chen, who began serving up her family-recipe sheng jian bao in the spring of 2018, after years as a stay-at-home mom. “I’m just waiting.” But she held on to optimism because, as she put it, “everyone knows Portland for food carts.”

Others grew cynical and worried that when summer faded, cart owners would be abandoned to their own fates. Property owners from the outskirts of town dropped off flyers offering to buy the carts or rent spaces in the culinary hinterlands. City Center Parking employees handed out warnings that any cart left on the lot come July 1 would be towed at the owner’s expense.

Richard Tran was considering to packing it in and selling the truck. He had started Rolls Plus Grill eight years ago, paying $14,000 for a seven-year-old cart after being laid off from Nike. “I like to cook,” he says. “I cooked when I was in Vietnam when I was 16 years old. I cooked for my family, my cousin’s family.”

On June 28, three days before the eviction, Prosper Portland, the city’s development agency, announced that it had donated the parking lot of a derelict post office to store carts for at least six months. Keith Jones launched a Gofundme campaign to pay for towing. Jones also arranged Mandarin, Thai, Arabic, and Spanish translators to speak with cart owners at a meeting the night before to curtail any further confusion.

Tow trucks arrived to begin clearing the tightly packed parking lot the next day, and a game of reverse Tetris ensued. Many carts had been at Alder Street for years, neglected by successive owners. Tires were flat and axles were busted. The towering Boom Crêpes slipped off its cinderblock foundation while being jacked up for new wheels, rattling the two employees still inside serving customers.

There was relief, but also sadness. A man dismantling the awning of Aybla Grill said that he’d been there for 16 years. Young Kim of 1 Bento Korean BBQ had spent the past 13 years selling kalbi short ribs done in his grandmother’s style alongside his wife and one longtime employee. By Sunday night, the last day before eviction, carts had been towed by two companies at a cost of $7,500.

“It’s great that we have a safe place to store our cart,” Lily Chen, a full-time student whose father Qing worked at their Hua Li House, wrote in an email. “Before, we were not sure how we were going to tow it, and where to store it. Our last resort was towing it home to our driveway. It’s generous of Prosper Portland to help us with this!”

Cart owners like Chen were uncertain how long they could wait before finding another way to make a living. “My dad has been cooking for a long time, and he loves it. He loves being able to interact with our customers, even though there may be a communication barrier,” she writes. “He also does it because both my sister and I are in school, and tuition is costly.”

Jones says he’s hoping to put together a group of volunteers to help repair the carts. “So when they do move they’ve got a fresh coat of paint and they’re ready to get started from scratch.”

While the carts have idled outside the vacant post office, Jones, Qing Chen, and others began addressing a long-ignored problem. Alder Street had become a pod organically, without the modern infrastructure that later pods had built in. Many vendors had been allowed to operate in open violation of many city codes, from unlicensed awnings hanging over sidewalks to wastewater running along the ground to open storm drains. When the carts opened again they would have to be street legal from all four sides.

But it still remained to be seen when the carts would reopen. The temporary site around two blocks of city park fell through on July 10, which Jones said city officials attributed to neighbors. Jones was concerned that too much infrastructure would be required for a short-term location. Two carts left storage within the first week of July to re-open in other existing pods, and as a last resort, Jones was prepared to begin placing carts individually or in small groups on whatever property he could find.

A solution appears

Last week, the city announced that a new pod would be constructed at Ankeny Square, a disused public park three blocks from Alder Street. Individual carts will sit on city streets, with potential seating in the square. The new location came about through the collaboration of the Portland Bureau of Transportation, the Bureau of Parks and Recreation, and the Friends of the Green Loop. The latter group secured permits from both bureaus and will serve as a landlord to the cart owners. The Gofundme campaign Jones started is collecting funds to pay for infrastructure, and the business association Travel Portland contributed a lump sum of $25,000 to get things started.

But this solution won’t solve the city’s larger problems. As Portland’s population swells, many more of the parking lots these carts began populating in hodgepodge fashion decades ago will most likely be developed. Lot after lot will eventually close and those carts will need new homes. The other pods around the city can’t absorb them all. And some of those have already become imperiled by land sales.

But the forthcoming Ankeny Square pod may be the first phase of the long-discussed “Culinary Corridor.” Keith Jones originally began working with food cart owners when early plans for the corridor included stretches of Portland’s proposed Green Loop, a six-mile, car-free urban trail plotted along both sides of the Willamette River, which separates downtown from most of the residential neighborhoods.

Time will tell how quickly the Ankeny Square pod will be up and running. Many of the remaining carts may have to move elsewhere just to make a living while the details get worked out.

At the heart of the change are big questions about the city’s priorities. How important are small businesses to Portland’s leaders? Are low-barrier opportunities for new immigrants a priority? Is Portland, a city that has long trafficked in its own quirkiness, becoming too slick to make space for the kinds of operations that put it on the map? What will remain?

“I got involved with Culinary Corridor and that’s my angle here,” said Jones. “But then I realized that there are so many players involved in this, on the private side and the public side. No one was talking to each other. I thought, ‘These are people’s lives and businesses, so we’ve got to get organized.’”

Correction: The subhead has been corrected to reflect that the city of Portland did not shut down the Alder pod; developers did.

• Will Portland’s Development Boom Leave Room for Its Food Carts? [Civil Eats]",[]
https://www.geekwire.com/2019/portland-quietly-launches-mobile-location-data-project-alphabets-controversial-sidewalk-labs/,['Portland'],Portland quietly launches mobile location data project with Alphabet’s controversial Sidewalk Labs,"People in the Portland metro area with smartphones may not realize it, but they have digital clones.

After months of preparation, the initial phase of Portland’s project employing city mobility software from Sidewalk Labs, the controversial startup owned by Google parent Alphabet, is underway.

If all goes as planned, Portland will launch a year-long pilot of the Replica software, costing nearly $500,000 in total. In exchange, Portland gets access to a massive dataset that mirrors how people actually move throughout the city and its surroundings.

The purpose is to regularly query, for example, timely insights into what worker commutes entail, what the impacts of Uber and Lyft are on traffic congestion, and how many cyclists use protected bike lanes such as those along high-trafficked areas like Governor Tom McCall Waterfront Park.

“We’ll be looking to Replica to explore a number of questions about major issues in our region like equity, safety, and congestion,” said Eliot Rose, technology strategist at Portland’s Metro, one of the three agencies chipping in to pay for the $457,000 project also funded by TriMet and Portland’s Bureau of Transportation.

One might expect such an effort to entail surveillance cameras, sensors, or other physical tracking devices, but that’s not what this is about. Instead, the Replica software uses deidentified mobile location data showing how people actually move throughout the city to generate a mock modeled populous engaged in simulated travel activities.

The Replica system associates nuanced trip patterns with each persona engaged in home, work, shopping, eating or recreational activities. Sidewalk Labs said its data comes from mobile app publishers, mobile location data aggregators and telcos. Both Sidewalk Labs and Portland Metro confirmed that no sensors, beacons, cameras, IoT devices or WiFi hotspots or WiFi kiosks will be used or installed as part of the firm’s partnership in Portland.

Still, there are questions about the specific origins of the data used in Replica.

“If a city is going to use a system, it has a responsibility to have full transparency about where all of the data is coming from, how it is being deidentified and to what level, and if that data is reused again or stored by Replica or Sidewalk or passed to its parent company,” said Pam Dixon, executive director of Oregon-based nonprofit World Privacy Forum. “There’s too much that we don’t know.”

To assess how transportation options affect low-income worker commutes, Replica may include demographic information such as deidentified credit- and census bureau data to estimate age range, race, gender, household size and income-levels. Portland’s own data showing vehicle, bicycle and pedestrian counts, TriMet transit ridership data, and estimates from Metro’s own travel model can also be added.

Here’s how Replica explains its data collection procedure:

De-identified mobile location data: We use de-identified mobile phone location data to generate travel behavior models — basically, a set of rules that represent how a person makes choices on where, when, why, and how to travel. Synthetic population generation: Separately, we use aggregate demographic information to create what planners call a “synthetic population”. This is a virtual population that is statistically representative of the real population. Computer simulation: We then give each person in the virtual population a travel behavior model and use computer simulation to generate a week of activities–helping us confidently replicate trip patterns across a city or metro area.

In an effort to understand how people travel to and from Portland throughout the region, the Replica system will encompass Multnomah, Clackamas, Washington, and Clark Counties.

Other cities including Chicago and Kansas City will also test Replica.

Pros and cons of a synthetic city population

Some say they like this synthetic population approach because it provides a reflection of what’s likely happening on city streets, arguably without the privacy invasions associated with surveillance and identifiable information. It’s especially attractive when compared to how governments historically gather commuter information through studies that generate static data with a limited shelf-life.

Now, the argument goes, they can skip the study and tap the replicated database to gauge the impact of a new light rail line or a street closure.

“This is all information that we would otherwise have to collect by sending people out into the field to do counts and surveys, which is very expensive and time-consuming,” said Rose.

Importantly, with location data from mobile devices in people’s pockets, they can track movement patterns of walkers, bikers, skaters and others not traveling in more-trackable vehicles. “We haven’t seen any tools that have offered the kind of information Sidewalk Labs is offering regarding pedestrian and cyclist mobility,” said Rose.

The city will not receive any actual mobile location data through the pilot; rather, it accesses an online platform that allows staff to query and filter data based on the simulated population.

Despite the privacy-safe assurances, data privacy and security experts question whether mobile location data, even when deidentified, is safe from re-identification if leaked, hacked or obtained by law enforcement. Others worry about the consequences of predictive modeling or machine learning techniques that determine with high levels of accuracy whether a simulated person might visit a particular location at a particular time.

“People who are moving within cities need to be able to trust that their data is truly de-identified and will never come back at them — for example, through a judicial process or law enforcement process — and would not be used against them in a discriminatory or unfair manner,” said Dixon.

According to a Portland Bureau of Transportation spokesperson, the contract with Sidewalk Labs prevents law enforcement or any entities other than Metro, PBOT or TriMet from accessing Replica software or data. But lots of data-related questions remain; rules dictating access to the information used to build the synthetic models, or the data reflecting their behavior, are unclear.

Portland City Council voted to use the Replica software in December. The city now awaits an initial dataset from Sidewalk Labs that it will test against criteria the three agencies have devised, possibly by July. If it passes muster, it will begin paying 12 cents per resident to access the software for a year, receiving refreshed data each quarter.

Rose said the city is testing whether Replica can be used to identify people. “If we find that it can, we intend to terminate the agreement,” he said.

The Portland City Council intended to vote on a privacy resolution requiring the city to ensure transparency and accountability in its data use and collection on Wednesday, but the vote was postponed.

How Replica got its start

Research partially funded by AT&T and the State of California Department of Transportation conducted at UC Berkeley and presented in a 2017 paper offers a glimpse into the origins of the Replica system. “One of our goals is to enable activity based travel demand models that use cellular data to create synthetic agent travel patterns without compromising the privacy of cell phone users,” states the paper.

One of the researchers involved in the study, Alexei Pozdnoukhov, currently serves as director of research at Sidewalk Labs. Another researcher on the project mentioned his internships at Sidewalk Labs and AT&T in his dissertation.

Not only was the research funded by AT&T, it employed data from the company, as confirmed by a Sidewalk Labs spokesperson. The paper notes the research employed anonymized and aggregated Call Detail Record logs “collected in Summer 2015 by a major mobile carrier in the US, serving millions of customers in the San Francisco Bay Area.” CDR logs feature various details of mobile calls including time, duration, completion status, source number, and destination number. AT&T did not respond to requests to comment for this story.

Several companies pool mobile location data over time to build models for things like ad targeting, marketing insights, or to help municipalities plan development. Those data providers rarely reveal where the information comes from.

Sidewalk Labs is not alone in its apparent use of raw cellphone data, which is made available to businesses directly from telcos as well as through third party data firms.

A New York Times article this past December revealed how dozens of companies sell anonymous smartphone location data to advertisers, retailers, and even hedge funds, without the knowledge of individual users.

Sidewalk Labs launched in 2015 but has already drawn heat in conjunction with its highly-scrutinized partnership with a Toronto revitalization group aiming to turn the Quayside waterfront neighborhood into a “global hub” of “urban innovation.”

Despite introducing prototypes of heated hexagonal paving systems and “building raincoats” that protect sidewalks from the elements, the plans for Toronto mostly remain a mystery. Local activists there express concerns about Sidewalk’s lack of meaningful community engagement, as well as its proposal to fund Toronto land development and garner tax revenue through a controversial bond scheme.

All of the stakeholders have an interest in this data so it needs to be managed with the input of all of the stakeholders.

In April, the Canadian Civil Liberties Association filed a lawsuit against Waterfront Toronto and Canadian government entities, arguing that “the process that resulted in the Quayside agreements was not transparent, reasonable or accountable.” Sidewalk Labs has also spurred criticism for its efforts to guide government policy for city data management.

Questions around city data use, ownership and security are immensely important. But the Sidewalk Labs partnership in Toronto also demonstrates the need to ensure that citizens can participate in decisions regarding technology use that ultimately affects government policy.

“There’s a different level of responsibility for municipalities,” said Dixon. “All of the stakeholders have an interest in this data so it needs to be managed with the input of all of the stakeholders.”

Whether Portland city residents are aware of and understand the Replica project is questionable. When asked about government outreach involving Replica, PBOT pointed to the City Council’s public hearing on the issue and a Civic Data Forum hosted in January by Smart City PDX, the city’s group overseeing emerging tech projects in Portland. That event was intended to “foster engagement with and outreach to diverse stakeholders in the community impacted by data collection,” according to the Smart City PDX website.

Though it does not oversee the Replica project, Smart City PDX was created to guide Portland’s data and technology investments. Smart City PDX Manager Kevin Martin admitted the city could do a better job of communicating the value proposition for tech projects such as Replica to residents.

“I think that’s on us to really figure out how we better communicate,” he said. “How innovations around data and technology can make your life better and how you need to work with us to make sure that things that happen with data and technology don’t make your life worse.”",[]
https://therivardreport.com/san-antonio-urban-design-paves-a-path-toward-widespread-obesity/,['San Antonio'],San Antonio Urban Design Paves a Path Toward Widespread Obesity,"San Antonio’s built environment does not support physical activity, promoting lifestyles that lead to obesity and a number of health problems. The inclusion of a micromobility lane for bikes and e-scooters as a part of the Broadway Street redevelopment project – a project supported by Mayor Ron Nirenberg – could be a catalyst for urban design that promotes public health. But the benefits can only be reaped if every zip code is included, starting with the most disadvantaged.

Research has found land use mix, minutes in a car, and distance walked as significant indicators of Body Mass Index (BMI) across all gender and ethnic groups, underscoring the importance of urban design. However, the urban design of San Antonio discourages physical activity, prioritizing drivers over walkers or bikers. Without protected bike lanes, well-maintained sidewalks, and reduced vehicle lanes, San Antonio scores 131.2 on the Pedestrian Danger Index in comparison to the national average of 55.3.

According to the Active Living Council of San Antonio, 75 percent of Bexar county adults do not meet the 150-minute moderate-to-vigorous weekly physical activity requirement as cited by the Center for Health Statistics. While individual choices play a part, we must understand individual choices in the context of environment.

In Bexar County 65.7 percent of our adults and 32 percent of our adolescents are overweight or obese. What is even more alarming, is that the prevalence of obesity in Bexar County is disproportionately concentrated in the inner city (inside loop 410) and Southwest and Southside school districts. Not coincidentally, these areas, including zip codes 78202 and 78207, experience the city’s highest concentrations of low-income and uninsured individuals.

Health care, however, is only one factor contributing to good health and its impact is limited. Decades of compelling research suggests that social determinants such as physical environment, socioeconomic status, education, and social networks play an overwhelmingly important role in explaining our health status.

Yet, the zip codes with the most to gain from multimodal streets are not being included. While the road north of Interstate 35 to Hildebrand Avenue is included in these plans, the mile leading south into downtown from Interstate 35 extending access to 78202 is not. The obesity rate in San Antonio cannot be expected to change if intervention is not applied to areas experiencing the highest prevalence. All San Antonio citizens should get easy access to health-promoting neighborhood conditions that support us in reaching and maintaining healthy BMI, but we need to start with neighborhoods that need the most support.

It’s time we get serious about our health and the implementation of non-motorized linkages between residential, commercial, and employment areas as one important approach to improving the health of all San Antonio residents. Promoting active living spaces is important because evidence from Texas studies shows that school-based intervention promoting biking for students and parents has resulted in significantly increased recreational activity. Implementing urban design that promotes physical activity will simultaneously foster safety, equality, social cohesion, economic vibrancy, clean air, and employment in San Antonio.

San Antonio has already implemented an effective model of social and environmental change for public health. More than a decade ago, neighborhood groups, business associations, and residents joined together to support a tobacco ban in public areas. Preventing health risks attributed to obesity in the same way tobacco was identified as a leading cause of preventable disease must be a priority of San Antonio. Tobacco limits imposed from 2010 to June 2019 prioritize the health of those under 21 with limited restrictions of civil liberties for adults who choose to smoke. Our children deserve the same environmental protections from obesity as they do from tobacco.

The obesity epidemic will require changes social, economic, and built environments; the choice is to modify our society to accommodate obesity or health. Obesity intervention requires a social change from the individual to the collective. When we choose to value our health as well as our health care, we will collectively reap the physical, economic, and social benefits of health equity.",[]
https://sanantonio.culturemap.com/news/city-life/07-09-19-urban-farm-grows-in-san-antonio-food-desert-garcia-street/#slide=0,['San Antonio'],New neighborhood urban farm crops up on San Antonio's East Side,"A new urban farm is taking shape on San Antonio’s East Side, designed to help fight food insecurity in an area where many residents lack access to fresh, healthy produce. On June 12, San Antonio Housing Authority, San Antonio College’s William Sinkin Eco Centro, and Compost Queens gathered to break ground on the Garcia Street Urban Farm at 218 Garcia St.

The 4.1-acre urban farm will be one of the largest of its kind in San Antonio, and will serve as an educational and food production hub in a food desert. (Food deserts are classified as neighborhoods where most residents live more than one mile from the nearest supermarket.)

“Today, we celebrate a community resource that will address food insecurity and provide educational opportunities to help residents learn about healthy choices,” David Nisivoccia, SAHA president and CEO, says in a press release.

The farm will grow a variety of crops, and contain a medicinal garden, pollinator gardens, a chicken coop, a picnic area, and an educational center. Project organizers focused on water and soil conservation in designing the farm in order to make it sustainable and to reduce flooding and drainage runoff.

The fruits and vegetables grown at Garcia Street Urban Farm will be offered to area residents, who will also be provided the chance to rent their own space to grow produce.

Residents will be able to “pay” for their plot by contributing a portion of their harvest to the neighborhood, volunteering on the farm, or promoting healthy food options and urban farming to community members.

Following 10 years in planning, this urban farm is part of SAHA’s Choice Neighborhoods Critical Community Initiatives plan funded through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development’s Choice Neighborhoods Implementation Grant.

SAHA and other local partners have spent the last few years working to redevelop the former Wheatley Courts public housing complex into a mixed-income, high-quality community to revitalize this part of the East Side.

“It takes one item of a neighborhood to be improved, to improve the entire block. It’s a chain reaction,” says Zuleika Morales-Romero, director of HUD’s San Antonio field office.

Once farm construction is finished this fall, the Eco Centro will manage the farm in collaboration with Compost Queens. Eco Centro is a community outreach center for environmental sustainability. Compost Queens is a local compost recycling program that turns food waste into nutrient-rich soil.

This collaboration, project partners say, will result in opportunities for community members to engage in volunteerism, and to educate each other about healthy eating habits and urban agricultural research.

There’s been an uptick in urban farming around San Antonio; some advocates feel urban farms such as the Garcia Street project can also spark employment opportunities in that more people will be compelled to launch similar farms elsewhere or become certified in urban agriculture and teach others best practices.

The Garcia Street farm isn't the only initiative underway to reduce food insecurity in San Antonio. District 3 City Councilwoman Rebecca Viagran recently launched a pilot program to invite corner stores to carry fresh fruits and vegetables at affordable prices.

A handful of stores thus far have enrolled in the program, which currently focuses on the city’s South Side. But local leaders hope it’s successful so that more stores citywide, especially in low-income areas, will load up on fresh produce to increase people’s immediate access to healthy, affordable, locally grown food.",[]
https://www.texastribune.org/2019/08/13/whos-helping-homeless-more-austin-or-san-antonio/,"['San Antonio', 'Austin']",Greg Abbott said San Antonio could teach Austin how to help homeless people. Experts disagree.,"*Correction appended

Just a couple of months ago, Steve Harrell got a ticket just for sitting in downtown Austin. It was around 4:30 p.m. and he was among a group of other people experiencing homelessness when a police officer approached, pointed at him and issued the citation, he told officials at an Austin City Council meeting last month.

“There has to be a better way,” he said at the meeting.

Two weeks later, the law that got him the ticket was changed when the City Council reformed three municipal ordinances criticized for criminalizing homelessness.

Lying or sitting down in public is no longer prohibited as long as people don’t block access to spaces. Simply asking for money is no longer illegal, though aggressive confrontations are. And sleeping in some public spaces (excluding parks and City Hall) is no longer banned, unless it is deemed to endanger someone’s health or safety — or if it impedes the “reasonable use of a public area.”

Debate over the changes went until 2:20 a.m the day of the final vote. Some residents and business organizations, like the Austin Downtown Alliance, worried the updates would make the streets dirtier or make it more unsafe for some to walk at night.

“Until you actually have safe places identified [for homeless people to stay], we don't understand why you're changing the ordinance,” said Kimberly Levinson, vice president of the Downtown Austin Neighborhood Association.

But many people who showed up supported the measure. The council approved two of the ordinances unanimously and the camping ordinance passed with a 9-2 vote. The debate could have ended there. But it didn’t.

In yet another episode of the ongoing fight between cities and the state, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott threatened to override the ordinances. Saying that “the horror stories are piling up,” he shared a tweet that wrongly linked a car accident to a group of people experiencing homelessness running into traffic.

Later, when asked by The Texas Tribune in a press conference about possible solutions to the issue, he pointed to the approach taken by San Antonio’s largest homeless organization.

“There are so many options that are available that are superior to people camping out on Congress Avenue,” Abbott said. “Probably the best template for this is a strategy that's been developed in San Antonio that I urge all communities to take a look at as the possible best practice. It's called Haven for Hope because what it does — it does not ignore the homeless; it helps the homeless be placed on a pathway toward recovery and improvement in their lives.”

But while one of Haven for Hope’s chief approaches to combating homelessness has helped keep people with nowhere else to go out of the city’s downtown, experts say it doesn’t follow what the evidence — or even what the federal government — suggests to help people find stable housing.

Just 10 minutes away from the Alamo, west of San Antonio’s downtown, Haven for Hope’s massive 22-acre campus is dedicated to taking care of people experiencing homelessness. Before Abbott referenced the group’s approaches as an example for the state, he gave it the Governor’s Volunteer Award in 2017.

With an annual budget of approximately $20 million, Haven for Hope serves around 1,700 people on any given day, according to CEO and President Kenny Wilson. Around 80% of people who seek help for homelessness in San Antonio come through Haven for Hope’s $100 million campus, which has dormitories for men, women and families and an open sleeping area called the Prospect’s Courtyard.

“This is primarily people from the streets that can come in and stay with us one night or a year,” Wilson said. “And in both places, anyone who stays at Haven, they have access to good food, three great meals a day, hot meals, laundry, medical care and clothing.”

Brenda Mascorro is the executive director of the South Alamo Regional Alliance for the Homeless, the regional planning body in Bexar County that coordinates housing and services funding for homeless families and individuals. She said Haven for Hope’s shelter and collaboration with 184 nonprofit partners is a critical part of San Antonio’s response to the issue.

“The benefits of Haven for Hope are vast,” she said.

Wilson said 5,000 people have gone through Haven for Hope’s “transformational program,” where people experiencing homelessness are given personalized help finding places to live.

“We follow them, and after a year about 90% of them are still in their home,” Wilson said.

But not everyone agrees with the organization’s approach. Program participants can be asked to take a urine test or a breathalyzer if alcohol or drug use is suspected. If people are intoxicated or high, they can’t enter the campus until they are sober. Once sober, they will meet with a treatment team to discuss the situation and analyze if treatment is needed.

This approach contradicts the current trend in homelessness services, which instead aims to find housing — despite conditions like alcoholism or drug use — and then focus on solving other problems through support services. This is what experts call the “housing first” model.

In the last two decades, dozens of studies have quantified what many say is the model’s positive impact. The American Journal of Public Health published a study in 2004 that found around 80% of people helped through the housing first model remained housed after two years.

At the same time, research suggests that model saves taxpayers by cutting the costs of jailing or providing health care to people experiencing homelessness. A study published in 2006 found that in Denver, the approach led to a decline in emergency room visits that saved $31,545 per program participant. And incarceration days and costs were reduced by 76%.

The model is used elsewhere in Texas, including in Houston, which has been successful in cutting its rate of people experiencing homelessness. And the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has adopted it as policy since George W. Bush’s administration. Current HUD Secretary Ben Carson supports it, and the agency considers its use a priority.

“While it might be more expensive because you are providing housing, it ends up saving money,” said Gary Painter, director of the Homelessness Policy Research Institute at the University of Southern California. “It is at least [as] cost effective as the other model and also certainly much more effective” in terms of keeping people housed, he said. “If you get an outcome that is far more better without more costs, why wouldn’t you do it?”

Wilson, with Haven for Hope, said that his organization partially relies on the housing first approach, through services offered by the organization’s partners. But he added that “there is no one way to solve homelessness.” He said that he has seen people get sober, find a place to live and then relapse.

“The downside of just saying, ‘Get people in a house,’ is their needs are so profound, so deep, so lengthy,” Wilson said.

But some people disagree with another aspect: having one massive shelter for a major city. The national trend is to have multiple smaller shelters.

“Haven for Hope is a big shelter with a big budget, but it does not end homelessness,” said Robert Friant, managing director for the Corporation for Supportive Housing, a New York-based organization that finances and consults on homelessness and housing. “Shelters don’t end homelessness. We need affordable housing. And what I’m conveying is evidence based. Homes end homelessness.”

The Texas Homeless Network, the non-profit that coordinates homeless efforts across the state, values the work done in Haven for Hope, but emphasized that the goal is to find permanent housing for everyone experiencing homelessness.

“Many communities have had success with ending homelessness for special populations but housing was the key piece. Houston, Austin, San Antonio, and most recently Abilene, have all effectively ended Veteran homelessness by securing housing and placing people in those units quickly. We know this can be replicated in other areas and with other subpopulations but we need housing,” the organization said in a statement.

In San Antonio, the number of people experiencing homelessness has remained more or less stable since the subprime mortgage crisis ended. Although the annual count is hardly a precise census, it does underscore that San Antonio hasn’t been able to decrease its homeless population the way Houston has.

Still, San Antonio has seen a visible change in the city’s urban core.

“Homelessness in downtown San Antonio has dropped about 80% since San Antonio Haven for Hope opened,” Wilson said. “We're near downtown, as I said, and we have 1,700 people here. I often wonder where would they be if they weren't here. And many of them would be downtown and on the River Walk, in front of the hotels.”

Multiple shelters and permanent housing

Since the approval of Austin’s reworked ordinances, Downtown Austin Alliance workers have seen the number of encounters with people sleeping or lying in public areas in the business district rise from 2,000 to 4,000 a month, CEO Dewitt Peart said at a forum organized by KUT radio earlier this month.

But at the same KUT event, Mayor Steve Adler strongly defended the policy.

“We haven’t created any more people experiencing homelessness over the last month. Now they are more visible,” Adler said, “but it is still the same person that needs a place to stay.”

The mayor said previous versions of the ordinances were costly to the city at a time when market-driven housing prices are rising for residents.

""I am tired of wasting taxpayer dollars not addressing this situation and just moving people around that are trying to comply, but living in a city where it is impossible,"" Adler said.

Austin’s approach has been to steer funds toward multiple shelters and permanent housing before addressing other issues like substance abuse.

“It’s so expensive to shelter people without having the resources to get them out and back to housing and to the community,” said Ann Howard, who recently stepped down as executive director of Austin’s Ending Community Homelessness Coalition to run for the Travis County Commissioners Court. “It really comes down to money: Those huge campuses become intractable.”

City officials will discuss opening one shelter in each City Council district. In June, the council approved the construction of a new center in South Austin.

“It’s a housing focused center, that people go through and not to,” council member Ann Kitchen said at the KUT forum. “It’s a safe, welcoming place to live and be connected to services to help them get to permanent housing.”

Austin plans to spend $15.3 million of the city’s next budget in homelessness relief. That includes money for rental assistance, legal aid and the new shelter that the city recently approved.

And the local homeless organizations are also partnering for a “pay for success” project, a new approach in Texas through which financial institutions, foundations and a health-focused organization would fund housing and assistance for 250 individuals that have been in and out of jails and hospitals. The success of the interventions will be measured with data related to recidivism, the amount of emergency room visits and how many individuals remain housed. If it is successful, investors get their money back. This way, the financial risk of the intervention doesn’t fall on the government.

“Republicans and Democrats can work together on it because it's fiscally conservative for the government, since it shifts the risk” away from taxpayers, Howard says. “The hope is that if the data proves that this permanent supportive housing helps, then we expect that governments will fund this and let go of funding things that they don't have data for or that don’t prove out.”

https://www.expressnews.com/news/local/politics/article/San-Antonio-could-institute-a-voluntary-gun-14379283.php,['San Antonio'],San Antonio may adopt voluntary gun buyback program in wake of mass shootings,"San Antonio could spend at least a quarter of a million dollars to buy back guns in the wake of mass shootings in Texas that have killed 58 people in the past two years, according to a plan proposed by two City Council members.

District 2 Councilwoman Jada Andrews-Sullivan and District 9 Councilman John Courage have asked their colleagues to take up the proposal, which would allow the city to buy firearms, clips and ammunition from owners who willingly put them up for sale.

The city would finance the buyback program using revenue from its asset forfeiture fund, which is paid for by sales of assets seized in criminal cases. That fund’s projected balance for the city’s upcoming fiscal year stands at about $2.2 million.

The proposal as written calls for using at least 20 percent of that fund to pay for gun purchases, which would be $440,000, but that could change. Monday, Courage said he would like to see at least $250,000 to start the program.

The proposal’s goal “is to reduce the number of weapons that could fall into the hands of bad actors or mentally unstable persons through illegal gun transfers, theft or accidental means,” according to a memo from the council members.

“To my way of thinking, if we get one gun off the streets that saves the life of one person, then that is invaluable,” Courage said.

Once the city buys guns, it would take them out of circulation by destroying them.

Andrews-Sullivan did not comment Monday.

The two council members plan to announce details of their proposal Tuesday.

The two proposed the buyback program about three weeks after a gunman fatally shot 22 people at an El Paso mall. Last year, another gunman killed eight students and two teachers at Santa Fe High School near Houston. A third gunman killed 26 people at First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, about 35 miles southeast of San Antonio, in 2017.

The council members hope the program, if passed, will help prevent homicides, mass shootings, suicides and instances of shooting deaths in domestic abuse cases.

Although interest in gun buyback programs usually ticks up in the wake of mass shootings, several studies have failed to show that buybacks prompt decreases in gun violence.

For example, a 2002 study found that buyback programs in Milwaukee County in Wisconsin didn’t turn up the kinds of guns usually used in homicides and suicides. Another study, analyzing Seattle’s 1992 buyback program, was inconclusive about whether it meaningfully curtailed violent crime and deaths caused by firearms.

Courage acknowledged those studies’ findings but said he hopes the program will generally improve public safety even if it doesn’t cause crime rates to drop. Those with “criminal tendencies” won’t likely sell guns to the city, he said.

“If they have those tendencies, whether they turn in a gun to us or not, they’ll find their way,” Courage said. “But they won’t find their way with the guns that we take.”

Whether the city would pay cash or use some other method for buying the guns remains to be seen, Courage said.

The Fort Worth Police Department gave out $50 gift cards rather than cash during its buyback program in 2017, according to a report by Texas Standard and Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting. The idea is to prevent people from turning around and buying more guns.

San Antonio police officers seized 736 firearms last year from criminals, according to a Police Department budget presentation last week — a figure Courage said he hopes the voluntary buyback program matches.

Police spokesman Jesse Salame did not immediately have figures available showing how many guns the department destroyed or sold in that time frame.

San Antonio has had at least one gun buyback program in the past two decades. The San Antonio Housing Authority spent more than $36,000 — including about $11,000 in funds from the Housing and Urban Development Department — to purchase about 430 guns in 2000.

So far, the proposal has gotten buy-in from at least three other council members — Ana Sandoval, Adriana Rocha Garcia and Manny Peláez — who signed onto the proposal last week.

At least one legislator has proposed a statewide gun buyback program. State Rep. Roland Gutierrez, D-San Antonio, included a $10 million gun buyback program in a series of proposed gun reforms he rolled out earlier this month.

https://www.utsa.edu/today/2019/03/story/MetroLab.html,['San Antonio'],MetroLab welcomes the City of San Antonio and UTSA,"(March 27, 2019) – The City of San Antonio (COSA) and UTSA have been selected as members of the MetroLab Network , a city and university collaboration for civic innovation, joining 44 cities, six countries and 60 universities across the country.

Led by COSA’s Office of Innovation and UTSA, the MetroLab team members will address issues and challenges faced by residents that can be addressed through research and education projects. The team is also building upon the strategy of SmartSA : to leverage new and emerging technologies and data to improve the quality of life for all San Antonians. SmartSA partners include CPS Energy, the San Antonio Water System (SAWS), the San Antonio River Authority (SARA), and VIA Metropolitan Transit.



“The City of San Antonio, in collaboration with our SmartSA partners, is driving forward a smart city 3.0 model that prioritizes community input regarding challenges that our constituency faces every day. We acknowledge that we can’t tackle these issues alone, which is why we are excited about partnerships like the one we now have with UTSA via the MetroLab network. Their expertise and energy will help ensure we remain inclusive, forward-thinking, and even more impactful in this space of urban innovation,” said Brian Dillard, chief innovation officer for the City of San Antonio.

Recent projects include the delivery of the Climate Action and Adaptation Plan (CAAP) of which UTSA scholars helped co-author. This was a project undertaken by COSA, CPS Energy, UTSA and the Texas Sustainable Energy Research Institute to integrate environmental stewardship and social equity. This included establishing a baseline inventory for greenhouse gases, developing future emission scenes, identifying mitigation strategies, assessing impacts throughout the city, and creating an implementation plan. This plan is currently under review by the San Antonio City Council and is open to public comments from city residents.

Another successful project was the “Under 1 Roof” program, which replaces worn and damaged roofs for disadvantaged homeowners and installs light-colored shingles and a radiant barrier. The goals were not only to address life/safety issues and improve health outcomes but also improve energy efficiency and reduce utility bills, while demonstrating the benefits of cool roofs for builders and residents. The program also offset the urban heat island effect by selecting homes that were clustered together. For each roof that was installed, data (utility, attic and roof temperatures) was collected and analyzed to assess the effectiveness of the program, which saw reductions in energy usage and cost savings to the homeowner.

Designated by the San Antonio City Council, the first Innovation Zones have been established in three key areas of the city: Brooks in the Southeast, the South Texas Medical Center in the Northwest, and Downtown. These zones will be used as proving grounds to test various types of smart city technology which could include: autonomous vehicles, smart streetlights, and various sensors. The goal is to address issues identified by local residents and stakeholders, prioritizing sustainability, access to services, and mobility.

The next project will hone in on the Digital Divide in San Antonio. The National Digital Inclusion Alliance found the city ranks 42nd out of 186 cities with 37.5% of household lacking access to broadband internet at home. The long term goal is to improve access and training opportunities to ensure citizens have the ability to interact with various digital platforms, for improved communication and better services for future implementations and ensuring all voices are represented and captured. The plan includes a way to share the data collected in a meaningful way via an accessible platform available to all stakeholders including residents.

The City of San Antonio will continue to work with their partners and the community to identify and define the issues, expand the aforementioned projects, and seek third-party funding through grants and awards. UTSA will be pulling experts from all colleges and disciplines where applicable with an emphasis on working with researchers from the College of Public Policy; Architecture, Construction & Planning including its Center for Urban and Regional Planning Research; Engineering; and the future School of Data Science.

“Over the past decade, UTSA has focused on research pertaining to sustainable communities and critical infrastructure, everything from water studies to low impact development, from smart grids and smart cities to sustainable economic development. Partnering with COSA will bring a number of disparate projects under the MetroLab umbrella, and track measurable impact in the years to come,” said Bernard Arulanandam, UTSA interim vice president for research, economic development, and knowledge enterprise.",[]
https://www.expressnews.com/news/local/article/San-Antonio-finds-another-way-to-fund-air-13908041.php,['San Antonio'],San Antonio finds another way to fund air conditioning in public housing,"After hitting a roadblock, the city of San Antonio found another way to come up with $500,000 to cool hundreds of public housing units that currently aren’t equipped with air conditioning.

The city, San Antonio Housing Authority and private foundations partnered earlier this year to provide $1.5 million to buy and install window air conditioners for almost 2,400 public housing units. Those apartments lack air conditioning unless tenants purchase and install the appliances themselves.

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development blocked the city’s first attempt to use federal grant money for its $500,000 contribution. The City Council agreed Thursday to instead use a different pot of money for the air conditioners and allocate the federal grant money for another project, according to a city news release.

“I’m encouraged by today’s action, and I’m sure the families who live in the units with no air conditioning are relieved that help will arrive soon,” Councilwoman Shirley Gonzales said in a statement. “Poverty does not mean people should live in substandard housing.”

SAHA oversees 6,137 public-housing units, roughly 40 percent of which aren’t equipped with air conditioning. Hundreds of those apartments were built in the 1930s and 1940s, decades before it became widely available.

But even today, HUD doesn’t mandate air conditioning in housing subsidized by federal tax dollars. It doesn’t provide funding for the appliances and generally discourages local housing authorities from installing them, unless electricity costs are paid for by tenants.

https://www.expressnews.com/real-estate/article/City-Council-could-vote-to-drastically-reshape-13937285.php,['San Antonio'],City Council could vote to drastically reshape areas near downtown San Antonio,"San Antonio officials are on the cusp of enacting a plan that could drastically reshape development in areas near downtown and along Broadway within the next two decades.

Residential and office development along Broadway has surged since 2010, fueled by the redevelopment of the abandoned Pearl Brewery into a mixed-use development with high-end apartments, restaurants and shops. City and county officials also have brought residents back downtown by subsidizing the construction of thousands of housing units in the area.

The Midtown Area Regional Center Plan could be the city’s next step in trying to revitalize San Antonio’s urban core.

City Council is expected to vote Thursday on the plan, a wide-ranging document that would guide land use, streets, sidewalks and parks — along major corridors leading into the center city — in the next two decades as more residents flock to neighborhoods near downtown.

“We’re not saying, ‘Okay, this is exactly how it’s going to happen,’” said Bridgett White, director of the city’s planning department. “We’re saying, in speaking with the community and looking toward the future, this is how we envision this area looking in the future. And, of course, it’ll take time.”

On ExpressNews.com: Details of proposed Hays Street Bridge land swap revealed

The proposal covers a J-shaped, 3.7-square-mile area that stretches from Interstate 10, encompasses neighborhoods directly north of downtown and the Pearl and runs along Broadway, stopping just north of the University of the Incarnate Word (UIW).

Among the potential land uses envisioned by a 21-member planning team — made up of neighborhood leaders, land developers and local education officials — are two “catalytic projects” along San Pedro Avenue. One would overhaul the corridor over the next two decades from a car-friendly environment dominated by fast-food restaurants and gas stations to one more amenable to pedestrians.

A mixed-use “gateway” with apartments, townhomes and ground-floor retail would take up three blocks along San Pedro south of Marshall Street — an area currently dominated by fast-food restaurants and a QuikTrip gas station. Roughly a half mile north, VIA Metropolitan Transit’s 30.6-acre site at 1021 San Pedro — in addition to its offices and bus maintenance operations — could include residences, retail and a trail connecting San Pedro Springs Park and Fredericksburg Road.

San Pedro isn’t the only midtown thoroughfare targeted for a potential makeover. The planning team identified Flores Street, Fredericksburg Road and Main and McCullough avenues just north of downtown as possible mixed-use “gateways” that would be prime spots for office, retail and residential development in the coming years.

The city is also preparing for development along the lower Broadway corridor near the Pearl and northward along Brackenridge Park toward Witte Museum and UIW. The plan designates the preferred future use of land south of Hildebrand Avenue along Broadway as mixed-use.

And the entertainment district on St. Mary’s Street — home to bars and live music venues like Paper Tiger and Limelight — would remain concentrated north of Josephine Street while the city encourages the establishment of more restaurants and retailers along the strip that operate during the day. City policy would support residential development along the half-mile stretch of St. Mary’s between Interstate 35 and Josephine.

The document directs city officials to adopt policies that bolster the area’s existing jobs base in the education, health care and service industries anchored by UIW, San Antonio College and Metropolitan Methodist Hospital and the St. Mary’s and Fredericksburg arts and entertainment districts.

The proposed plan mostly limits mixed-use development to main thoroughfares, away from residential areas in Tobin Hill, Five Points, Mahncke Park and Westfort — and discourages zoning changes in those neighborhoods. But the proposal also urges more housing options in the Midtown region for students, families and seniors at affordable rates.

“I think you have to be mindful of what’s there and the fact that we have to provide the housing, but also respect the longtime residents who are there, who live there, who have been there for a while,” White said.

On ExpressNews.com: It’s getting more expensive to own a home in Texas

But some members of the planning team that drafted the Midtown document are skeptical that the proposed strategies would help neighborhoods maintain their character and prevent displacement of residents with deep roots.

Not part of the discussion was how desired development outlined in the proposal would impact property values in areas that are already seeing those values skyrocket, said Mike Austin, a representative of the Tobin Hill Community Association.

“The residential aspect of Tobin Hill is going to be diminished over years,” Austin said. “It’s just going to be difficult for people to afford.”

Also unclear is how the proposal’s strategies would affect the area’s low-income residents, including senior citizens who live in facilities between McCullough and San Pedro, said Graciela Sanchez, director of the Esperanza Peace & Justice Center. Sanchez said she fears the proposal’s emphasis on mixed-use, inspired by the Pearl, will ultimately homogenize the area.

“It’s a space that’s not meant for me and I don’t feel that it is mine,” Sanchez said of the Pearl. “If that is the vision for the rest of the city or for other regions, it changes what San Antonio is about.”

https://www.archpaper.com/2019/09/the-railyards-in-sacramento/,['Sacramento'],The Railyards in Sacramento will be America's next big urban development,"A neglected parcel of land once home to a leg of the First Transcontinental Railroad could become the next Hudson Yards-like mega-development in the United States. The former Union Pacific Railyards spans 244-acres just north of downtown Sacramento, California,—the largest urban infill site in the country—and is currently being eyed for several large-scale projects.

Built in the 1860s, the site served the western terminus of a 1,912-mile-long stretch of rail line that extended from Council Bluffs, Iowa, to the Oakland Long Wharf in San Francisco Bay. Old, existing brick buildings used as maintenance shops in the yard’s heyday still exist on the massive industrial plot and serve up sour views for drivers along Interstate 5 or passengers on flights headed into the nearby airport.

Sacramento has long had a difficult relationship with the Railyards—environmental remediation has been ongoing for decades—but recent investment in the adjacent Downtown Commons district has brought in significant interest in revamping the underused land next door. For example, the Golden 1 Center, a new high-tech arena for the city’s NBA franchise, the Sacramento Kings, finished up construction in 2016 and has spurred the introduction of new hotels and businesses in the area.

Around the same time the venue was completed, the local city council approved a planning entitlement submitted by Downtown Railyard Ventures, a subsidiary of the development group, LDK Ventures, that bought the Railyards in 2010 for $18 million. The ambitious company has a masterplan to make the Union Pacific return to its roots as a central hub of activity and innovation.

In the next several decades, The Railyards, as the project is formally being marketed, will become a mixed-use urban landscape made to attract local residents, tech workers, and tourists. In total, there’s set to be 30 acres of green space, 70,000 square feet of retail, up to 10,000 residential units, 5 million square feet of office space, a 1,000-room hotel, and a mass transit hub with a new Amtrak station.

Preservation will be a key component of redevelopment on the site—unlike at Hudson Yards—with the partial reuse of the “Central Shops” buildings and the old Southern Pacific Sacramento Depot. It’s suspected that this area will become some sort of tech district for the city. In addition, three major architectural projects already in the works will anchor the initial phase of development.

By far the biggest and most-talked-about development coming to Sacramento is a new, $250 million soccer stadium for a future MLS franchise. The city has been in talks to upgrade its own team, Republic FC, to major league status now that it’s secured long-term funding from billionaire businessman Ron Burkle. The proposed development would include a 20,000-seat sports and entertainment arena situated on 14-acres of the Railyards’ northeastern corner, as well as a surrounding 17-acres of commercial buildings and retail.

Visuals for the project have already been revealed by architecture and infrastructure engineering firm HNTB and feature a square-shaped, open-air bowl with red inverted triangles that wrap and protect a 360-degree canopy. Fans will have unencumbered views of the surrounding city from anywhere around the pitch.

Housing is planned in between the arena and an upcoming 900,000-square-foot hospital by Kaiser Permanente. The healthcare giant announced in January that it had purchased 18 acres of land to build a state-of-the-art medical facility on the northwestern edge of the Railyards that will open in 2025 and offer services to the thousands of people who live downtown.

Other structures slated to come online include a light rail stop, two six-story office and retail buildings by RMW Architecture & Interiors, as well as a 175,000-square-foot museum. On the southernmost portion of the Railyards, there will be a 17-story complex housing the Sacramento County Courthouse. Designed by Miami-based studio MOTIV in collaboration with NBBJ, the largely-glass-clad structure is supposed to start construction this fall and open in 2023.",[]
https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/making-sacramento-the-farm-to-every-fork-capital,['Sacramento'],Making Sacramento the “Farm-to-Every-Fork” Capital,"“Farm to fork isn’t a passing fad or a marketing slogan in the Sacramento region — it’s the way we live,” touts the city’s tourism bureau on its website. And while trendy farmers markets and the “eat local” movement have had a part in perpetuating food inequities, a number of organizations in the California capital are working to expand access to healthy eating. The city itself has issued a call for proposals to revitalize its abandoned tree nursery so that more residents can grow their own healthy food and learn job skills related to farming while they’re at it.

“The biggest thing about urban agriculture, like scaling up from personal, is land access,” says Chanowk Yisrael, a farmer working half an acre of land in the South Oak Park neighborhood of Sacramento. “Even though we’re the farm-to-fork capital,” Yisrael says, “most of that is more for the commercial side. You’re talking about fine dining and foodies and those types of things.”

Yisrael and his wife, Judith, own the Yisrael Family Farm, which runs a program called G.O.O.D.: Growing Our Own Destiny. According to its website, the Yisrael farm has helped 40 people establish gardens in their yards over the past few years. The farm also offers classes on healthy eating habits and gives tours to introduce children and adults to the growing process from seeding to weeding and harvesting. Yisrael says that his neighborhood has a few acres of abandoned lots that could be used for gardening and farming. The challenge, he says, is that most of these lots don’t have water, and utility hookups can cost up to $6,000.

The Sacramento region’s Center for Land-Based Learning helps with land access and has educated high-school students from 27 counties in California about the food system and sustainable agriculture. In 2010, the organization expanded to work with adults thanks to funding allocated in the 2008 farm bill. After a seven-month farmer training program, participants move on to a business incubator.

“We, as a nonprofit, lease land, and then we kind of set it up so that it’s all ready to be farmed,” says Mary Kimball, the Center’s executive director. The organization takes care of irrigation systems, washing facilities and storage structures. Additionally, it provides the new farmers with equipment. The Center doesn’t cover all their costs, but the support helps farmers to get started.

Many of these incubator sites, Kimball says, are in food deserts, and many of the farmers who go through the training come from cities. Five farm sites, she says, are in West Sacramento where “they don’t have access, not just to food, but to fresh fruits and vegetables, healthy food.”

With its most recent graduating class, which completed the course in mid-September, the Center for Land-Based Learning has trained 150 farmers, and Kimball says 65 percent of those graduates continue to work in agriculture-related fields.

Being able to grow your own vegetables, however, shouldn’t be a prerequisite for getting access to healthy food. That’s one reason why Alchemist Community Development Corporation, which has a community garden with 15 plots in the Oak Park area of Sacramento, runs a program to boost residents’ buying power at farmers markets. Shoppers using CalFresh (SNAP benefits) get a 100 percent match when spending on fresh fruits and vegetables. In other words, spend $10 and get $20 worth of healthy eats. According to Sarah Dillon of Alchemist, the organization distributed $20,000 in matches across the 11 farmers markets in the Sacramento region in August 2019.

The city of Sacramento, meanwhile, is eyeing residents interested in cultivating their own food as it seeks proposals for transforming a 5-acre vacant tree nursery into a farming center in the Mangan Park neighborhood. Jennifer Venema, of the city’s sustainability office, says she expects five to 10 farmers could work the land. Venema says they hope to receive proposals that embrace a range of activities, from food growing to training and more.

“It means people in the neighborhood have access and can come in and grow things or buy things, and we really want to include learning and educational opportunities,” Venema says. “Having land is the big barrier for a lot of the small-scale, ag entrepreneurs. But having land is just one step. There’s a lot to getting that land ready.”

In addition to echoing Yisrael’s caveat about water access, Venema points out that vacant land often needs toxic substance remediation. The tree nursery, for example, took some time to be ready for the call for proposals in part because it is near a now-defunct gun range, and the ammunition needed to be removed to ensure that the soil wouldn’t transmit toxins to the food grown there.

Venema says that, although the funds will require approval by the city council, the expectation is that Sacramento will invest approximately $200,000 to revitalize the site. “The goal is to get someone that’s self-sustaining once we get the site prepared,” Venema says.

City Must Respond to Loss of Affordability

I’m doing two talks about Generation Priced Out: Who Gets to Live in the New Urban America in Sacramento on September 10 addressing the city’s affordability crisis. My timing is fitting, as Sacramento now reflects a new urban America where long affordable housing is no more.

After decades in which the Bay Area’s rising rents and home prices did not reach the state capitol, the affordability crisis has hit Sacramento hard. The days of cheap Sacramento rents are gone, and now the city must aggressively work to preserve its racial and economic diversity.

According to an article last week in the Sacramento Bee, rents in the city have risen 45% in the past seven years. This vaulted the city from the 45th most expensive metro area to the 11th.

Fortunately, Sacramento tenant advocates aggressively responded to the crisis by collecting 44,000 signatures to qualify a rent control and just cause eviction measure for the March 2020 ballot. This led the City Council to make a deal whereby the ordinance campaign would be dropped in exchange for the Council passing its own just rent control and just cause eviction law. The big difference is that the Council’s law limits annual rent increases to 6 percent plus inflation (which will likely mean a total of roughly 9% in the next year) while the ballot measure capped rent hikes at 5%.

To give some perspective, a ballot measure I co-authored in San Francisco in 1992 limits rent increases to 60% of inflation. San Francisco tenants have typically paid only 1-2% rent hikes since our Prop H initiative passed (I discuss the Prop H campaign in The Activist’s Handbook).

Sacramento tenants will likely pay almost four times higher annual rent increases than those in San Francisco. But San Francisco rent control started with a 7% annual increase, and higher increases took effect if the tenant failed to file a petition challenging the illegal hike. So one could say that Sacramento’s negotiated deal puts tenants in a better place than San Francisco tenants were in 1979.

It’s also true that the passage of AB 1482 would put Sacramento tenants in close to the same position they gained from striking the rent control deal. That will increase pressure on the City Council to reduce rent hikes locally.

Students at Sacramento State University, where I’ll be speaking at the University Library at 3pm, have been hit particularly hard by rising rents. Sacramento State Dean of Students Beth Lesen told the Bee in the article above, “We’re starting to look at things that we haven’t looked at before because we really just need our students to be housed. None of us ever expected to be in the business of finding affordable housing for students when we got into higher education.”

Her comments will surprise those who attended college in the greater Bay Area or Los Angeles, but they show how quickly longtime affordable Sacramento began pricing students out. It reminds me of what happened to another state capitol, Austin, Texas, as seemingly overnight it shifted from affordable to slackers to unaffordable to all those without high-paying jobs.

Sacramento’s Challenge

In November 2018, Sacramento passed Measure U, a 1/2 cent sales tax increase. Longtime housing activist Cathy Creswell, a member of the Measure U Advisory Committee, urged the new funds to be used for housing. “The growing crisis highlighted in this report must compel the city to make significant new investments in the development of affordable homes, especially for renters of modest means, and to provide safe and stable homes for people experiencing homelessness.”

Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg agreed with Creswell. He stated in May that “Measure U gives us the opportunity to have a real Housing Trust Fund that will allow us to help bridge the funding gap for projects that will address the severe shortage of affordable housing for our residents,” Steinberg said. “Thank you to the Sacramento Housing Alliance for recommending a comprehensive approach to this statewide crisis, of which a local funding source is a key piece.”

But as Los Angeles showed, passing funding measures for affordable housing does not end opposition to specific projects. Long affordable cities often have a hard time adjusting to new housing realities. And they worsen the crisis by refusing to take necessary actions to boost affordability.

Consider the Sacramento City Council’s unanimous rejection in September 2018 of a 24-unit 100% affordable project, the Luther Garden Apartments. The project was planned for a vacant field in a low-income neighborhood.

Why did the Council reject it? Check out the CBS news story on “the housing solution the city rejected.”

The member representing the area said “no doubt we need housing. But we need the right kind of housing.” Why was a 100% affordable project in a city facing skyrocketing private market rents not the “right kind”? According to one council member the 24 units made it “too dense.”

The real reason? The project was in a neighborhood zoned for single-family homes only. And those homeowners did not want tenants living in their neighborhood (one opponent said the area lacked appropriate “services” for seniors.”

The council’s vote preceded Measure U but reflects a deeper sense of denial about the city’s changed affordability future. As Austin, Culver City, and so many other longtime affordable areas show, Sacramento’s days as the affordable alternative to the Bay Area are gone. But that does not mean the city cannot steadily expand housing options for the working and middle-class and work to get federal and state assistance for low-income residents who need such help.

I wrote Generation Priced Out to address precisely the situation Sacramento finds itself in today. And I look forward to talking about solutions to the city’s affordability crisis in two events on September 10: 3pm at the CSUS University Library in an event I am doing for the Friends of the CSUS Library. And at 5pm at Avid Reader on Broadway.

I hope those concerned about Sacramento’s future can join us.

Yesterday the Sacramento City Council lowered speed limits near city schools to fifteen miles per hour.

“We don’t have enough opportunities to take actions like this,” City Councilmember Steve Hansen told Streetsblog. “Cities can be hamstrung from taking commonsense steps to make our streets safer. Any opportunity we have to push back on the 85th percentile rule, we should take.”

The “85th percentile rule” is the way current law requires that speed limits be set, a backwards method with the sole goal of preventing speed traps rather than improving safety. The rule tends to force cities to raise speed limits if they want to enforce them, and makes it very difficult to lower them.

Except in school zones. The California Vehicle Code allows a local jurisdiction to establish a speed limit as low as fifteen miles per hour:

when children are present

on local residential streets, within 500 feet of a school

when the maximum speed on nearby streets is thirty miles per hour

and when the road is no more than two lanes wide.

“Lowering speeds near schools is another big step towards our Vision Zero goal,” said Hansen. “Addressing vehicle speed is one of the clearest ways we identified to reduce traffic deaths and serious injuries. I’m proud of our Public Works Team for this big win for our kids.”

Sacramento has a high rate of traffic-related injuries, and–according to the California Office of Traffic Safety 2016 rankings–the highest number of speed-related injuries and deaths in the state. The city’s Vision Zero plan specifically calls out high speeds as a major factor in traffic-related injuries and fatalities.

A NHTSA study–one of many such–found that fatality and serious injury rates increase substantially as travel speeds rise. It’s bad enough when a child is hit by a vehicle traveling less than 20 mph, but once a vehicle’s speed reaches 21, the rate of serious or fatal injuries doubles.

Statewide, school zones generally have a 25mph limit, unless otherwise indicated. The Sacramento City Council’s action will add new 15-mph speed limit signs on 225 street segments near 124 city schools.

Jennifer Donlon-Wyant, an active transportation planner with the city of Sacramento, was part of the team that submitted the proposal to the city council for approval. “The city of Sacramento is committed to implementing our adopted Vision Zero actions,” she said, “and will take bold citywide actions like reducing our speed limits in all eligible school zones to 15 miles an hour.”

Morning drop-off times can bring heavy traffic to schools. One of the Vision Zero plan’s long-term goal is reducing the amount of vehicle traffic, and one way to get there is to make it safer for everyone who is not in a car. Reducing speed limits is the first step.",[]

Beginning in October, all students in grades K through 12 who live in or go to school in the city of Sacramento will be able to get a free pass on all Sacramento Regional Transit District (SacRT) buses and light rail. The program will last for a year, during which time it will be evaluated and potentially renewed.

The City of Sacramento will provide $1 million from its general fund to offset any potential revenue losses to SacRT. The general fund is supported in part by Measure U, a one-cent sales tax that has been approved and extended by city residents. The city invests some of that funding in an equity investment fund, for safety, housing and youth services and programming.

A transit pass program for students falls squarely in that pocket. The pass could potentially be used by 100,000 students, although SacRT estimates student ridership will likely rise to about 40,000 daily riders.

“It will make a big difference n the lives of young people and their communities,” said Sacramento City Councilmember Jay Schenirer, who championed the program. “This is an important investment in our neighborhoods, in our young people, and in our economy.”

Attendance problems and chronic absenteeism, he said, is frequently due to difficulties getting to school. Reducing those issues could help increase funding to schools from the state, since it is based on Average Daily Attendance. “It’s a win for SacRT, for the schools, for economic development–it’s absolutely good for young people to be able to get where they’re going,” said Schenirer. “And it’s good for the climate too. We could make a significant dent in vehicle miles traveled if we can reduce the number of school trips.”

“And if we can create lifetime public transit riders, investing this money now will pay off over time, once these kids become adults and know that riding transit is a good way to get around.”

“It will make a big difference in the lives of young people and their communities.”

Other cities have been creating similar fare-free programs. The city of L.A. just announced free passes for students on DASH buses, though not Metro. Other areas, notably San Francisco and Alameda County, have created programs to offer free transit to low-income students, but have found that the administrative costs of proving eligibility can be onerous.

Two years ago, Merced offered free rides to all transit riders during the month of August, and saw ridership spike. Colleges in many cities throughout the state have created student transit pass programs, which provide deeply discounted transit passes that have been found to benefit both transit agencies–who gain a reliable source of revenue and increases in ridership–and riders, who can hop on transit without having to scrounge for money for each ride.

Over the course of several recent legislative sessions, Assemblymember Chris Holden tried to create a statewide student transit pass program. But his attempts found tepid support in the legislature, with even less interest in providing funding. The latest student transit pass bill, A.B. 17, was vetoed by then-governor Jerry Brown, who said a “fuller discussion” was needed before a statewide program could be created.

The reason many of these programs are not more widespread could come down to disagreements over funding. Most of the ones listed above are funded under the Low Carbon Transit Operations Program, which gets money from cap-and-trade and is a rare potential source of funding for operations. Holden’s bills were stymied by this question of money, although he argued that a statewide transit pass program would be an appropriate use of cap-and-trade funding.

Meanwhile the city of Sacramento sees huge potential rewards from its investment. “We think that next year, once we see the results from the program launch, we will see a regional expansion,” said Schenirer. “My goal is to make it countywide, which would make logistics simpler, and also settle some equity considerations.” Under the current program parameters, students who live outside the city but go to school inside Sacramento are eligible for the passes, but their neighbors at nearby schools do not.

“But what I learned pretty early,” said Schenirer, “is that if you only look at transit as a social service, you will fail. But if we can look at this as a way to enhance ridership, we can get young people started early and it will pay off in the long run.”

The list below, of potential benefits from student transit pass programs, comes from a legislative analysis of A.B. 2222, one of Assemblymember Holden’s first tries at a statewide program.

Cleveland Public Power, a city-owned utility, deployed the T-Light Galaxy communications infrastructure in just three business days, utilizing FCC licensed frequencies to ensure the system is both secure and reliable. The system provider, ST Engineering Telematics Wireless, is a leader in smart city wireless networks and applications.



“This digital transformation of our streetlights fulfils a key component of the Safe, Smart CLE Project launched earlier this year,” said Cleveland Public Power Commissioner Ivan Henderson. The Project combines the conversion of all streetlights in the city to LED with the ST Engineering Telematics Wireless networked lighting control system and 1,000 cameras that are operated by the Cleveland Police Department. “Not only does the Telematics Wireless system enable us to control and manage our streetlight operations far more efficiently and cost-effectively, it also provides Cleveland the backbone for more advanced, future-ready Smart City applications like the high-definition images and our police department’s remote control of streetlights that can be dimmed or brightened throughout the city.”

Smart lighting controls can reduce annual operating costs by as much as 20 percent in addition to the anticipated 50 percent cost savings from converting to LED. In the Cleveland installation, the T-Light Galaxy platform functions as a wide-area communications network. The end-to-end solution provides a web-accessed application software, BrightCity™, with 61,000 individual networked lighting controllers for each streetlight’s operation. The system enables Cleveland to set different light intensity for residential, commercial and industrial locations, pre-program schedules for routine and real-time management of special conditions, and proactively manage maintenance support.

“Cleveland’s adoption and installation of the T-Light Galaxy streetlight control system is ultimately part of a bold statement from one of the country’s premier smart cities,” said Amir Hirsch, Business Development, ST Engineering Telematics Wireless. “It demonstrates a genuine commitment to visionary leadership, service, sustainability and cost containment for all the city’s citizens.”

For the Cleveland project, ST Engineering Telematics Wireless installed three gateways to cover the entire city’s network of streetlights, and a fourth gateway is planned for city-wide redundant coverage. The city plans to test other smart devices that run on Telematics Wireless’ Galaxy Network in the near future.

ST Engineering Telematics Wireless will be exhibiting at the Street and Area Lighting Conference (SALC) 2019 from September 22-25, 2019 in San Diego.

Cleveland city councilmember Matt Zone Monday evening introduced a resolution to form a working group to study domestic violence concerns and the feasibility of a safe leave policy in the city. The group will work with community partners to examine the ways that the city government, as well as private employers, can ensure that survivors of domestic violence have the capacity to heal, find shelter, and remain safe without the threat of losing their income and employment.According to the Cleveland-based Domestic Violence and Child Advocacy Center (DV/CAC), domestic violence-related concerns result in the loss of eight million days of work in the United States each year. Worse, up to sixty percent of domestic violence victims lose their jobs because of the disruptive nature of domestic violence.Melissa Graves, the CEO at the DV/CAC, can easily recount several instances in which the workplace can become a barrier for a survivor’s recovery. Individuals might miss work in order to seek medical attention, relocate to a new home or shelter, or to rearrange their financial situation. However, beyond these already significant burdens, Graves told Scene that survivors may need time off to ensure their child’s safety and to access legal protections. They may even need to stay away from their job out of fear that the abuser will visit that location.Yet, the federal government does not provide protections to ensure that domestic violence survivors can retain their jobs while taking the time they need to recover. Instead, states and individual cities must endeavor to create and implement policies that help protect these individuals and their loved ones.For Zone, this effort is deeply rooted in his prior experiences. As a personal bailiff in the domestic relations court, Zone assisted hundreds of survivors in their efforts to navigate the legal system. “I saw how barriers to having safe protection often impeded the ability of the judiciary from ensuring that there was safe protection for all individuals,” Zone told Scene.However, while Zone’s history connected him to the issue decades ago, it was a grassroots group that provided the catalyst for this current effort. Several students at the Cleveland Marshall College of Law spent their summer researching local policy issues as a core component of a graduate course. A few students in the class decided to take on the issue of safe leave. After reviewing data that highlighted the need for greater employment protections for survivors of domestic violence, the students were dedicated to producing legislation to resolve this issue.In a conversation with Scene, Lucia Lopez-Hisijos, one of the students involved in the project, explained that she first learned about an unpaid safe leave policy and believed it was a valiant effort the city should take on. While it would secure employment for people who took time off, it did not resolve the income concerns of survivors.Then, she learned that Philadelphia, New York and the entire state of New Jersey had adopted paid leave policies. After drafting some potential legislation, the students and their professor, Joseph Mead, approached Zone for his support. The Monday night resolution was a direct outcome of this work.Mead, an assistant professor at both the law school as well as the Levin College of Urban Affairs, is excited about the progress and told Scene that the effort was student-led and student-driven. “Over the summer, my students mixed passion, talent, and hard work to make a compelling case for safe leave policies,” said Mead. “We are looking forward to continuing to work with City Council and our community partners to study safe leave policies and other policies to support survivors.”Still, there is significant work to be done to bring any policy to fruition. Zone hopes that there will be movement on this effort by the end of the year and will look to community stakeholders, including those within the nonprofit and private sectors, to help develop this work.The resolution mentions other cities that have adopted policies to protect domestic violence survivors, such as Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Chicago, Minneapolis and St. Paul. The law students based their original suggestions on the Philadelphia legislation, which requires that all employers with ten or more employees must provide paid leave that can be used for safety concerns. Zone hopes to collaborate with large, local employers as well as the Council of Smaller Enterprises to build support for this effort.And yet, while a local policy would be a big win for the city, relying on individual cities to adopt policies would undoubtedly lead to an unequal distribution of access. Would the Beachwoods and Solons of the state be likely to adopt these practices? Perhaps not. In additional to local policies, a state level policy would likely provide additional, much needed protections.Safeguards like those that State Representative Janine Boyd (D-Cleveland Heights) has been advocating for since she arrived at the statehouse. Along with her efforts to promote a state-wide paid leave program, Boyd is working at the state-level to provide additional protections for survivors of domestic violence. Boyd’s most recent effort came in the form of “Aisha’s Law,"" a protective system that might have prevented the horrible murder of Aisha Fraser in 2018.“Aisha’s Law is for all Ohioans because domestic violence leaves in its wake families, communities, and all of us who are co-victims left to pick up the pieces,” Rep. Boyd said in a May 2019 press release. “Aisha’s Law is a continuum to unite law enforcement, the courts, and community stakeholders in partnership to change lives.”Like Boyd, Graves believes that these efforts must be as expansive as possible. “It is critical that we bring intimate partner violence out of the shadows,” says Graves. “We encourage all employers to think about how they would support domestic violence victims who are often too scared to let employers know for fear of losing their job.”",[]

For a single person, this means an income of less than $13,064. The poverty threshold for a single parent with two children is $20,231.

A suburb-by-suburb breakdown is not possible, because the new estimates the Census Bureau released are only for places of at least 65,000 people. But a cleveland.com analysis of what was released found 1-in-9 suburban residents in the county are in poverty, including 1-in-7 children.

Though there have been improvements in recent years (poverty rates topped out at 39.2% in the city and 11.1% in the suburbs in 2014), the latest estimates show poverty is still worse than in 2006, the year before the start of the recession.

Cleveland’s overall poverty rate for 2018 is 33.1%, up from 27% in 2006. For children, it is 50.5%, up from 41.9%.

In suburban Cuyahoga County, the overall rate of 10.9% in 2018 is up from 9.3% in 2006; suburban child poverty stands at 14.8%, up from 13% in 2006.

The poverty rate for the suburbs overall in Cuyahoga County is 10.8%, including 14.8% for children, according to new estimates for 2018 from the Census Bureau.

Nationally, among the places of at least 65,000, only four cities have higher poverty rates than Cleveland, the new estimates say.

They are Camden, New Jersey (40.9%); Flint, Michigan, (34.7%), and Detroit (33.4%), plus the college town of Bloomington, Indiana (33.8%). Rates in college towns can be higher because of student housing.

Other data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics help explain the local economic trends. Though Cuyahoga County’s unemployment rate is down from where it was at the start of the recession in December 2006, there are now 36,000 fewer jobs in the county since then, according to the BLS, and some employed people are working for less.

Overall, Cuyahoga County’s poverty rate is 17.7%, according to the new estimates, in comparison to 15.5% in Franklin County (Columbus area) and 15.4% in Hamilton County (Cincinnati area).

Seven Ohio counties of at least 65,000 residents have higher poverty rates – Athens (32.3%), Scioto (22.9%) and Ross (20.6%) in southern Ohio, plus Jefferson (20%), Lucas (18.6%), Trumbull (18.5%) and Ashtabula (17.8%).

The lowest countywide poverty rates are just outside large, urban areas – Delaware near Columbus at 4.1%, Warren near Cincinnati at 5%, and Geauga and Medina near Cleveland at 5.1% and 6.8%, respectively.

Summit County, which includes Akron, is at 11.7%. Other countywide poverty rates in Greater Cleveland are 14.6% for Lorain County, 11.2% for Portage and 6.9% for Lake.

Median household income ranges from $99,881 in Delaware County to $36,944 in Athens County.

In Greater Cleveland, median household income was reported at $82,784 for Geauga, $75,786 for Medina, $65,835 for Lake, $64,550 for Portage, $58,876 for Summit, $58,613 for Lorain, and $49,910 for Cuyahoga.

""This Heart of a Hero challenge is directly in line with the city's goal to improve environmental health through improved use of our resources and a reduced carbon footprint as outlined in OnePGH,"" said City of Pittsburgh Mayor, William Peduto. ""We applaud our city's employees for taking steps to improve their health while reducing their consumption of animal products.""

Working in collaboration with the City of Pittsburgh's CityFit Wellness & Benefits Team and Humane Action Pittsburgh, this event kicks off September 4 with an informational talk and cooking demonstration by Rip Esselstyn, a former Austin, Texas firefighter turned health ambassador and best-selling author. City employees and their families will then be invited to take the Seven-Day Rescue Challenge and eat a heart-healthy plant-based diet for one solid week, with a full menu of resources, recipes and online coaching.

""Heart attacks are the number one cause of in-the-line-of-duty deaths for firefighters and it ranks fifth for police officers,"" said Esselstyn. ""If our men and women on the front lines are at the highest risk for coronary disease, we want to equip them with the tools - and the delicious foods - needed to reduce their risk and help them be not only fit for duty, but fit for LIFE.""

Participants will receive before-and-after biometric screenings to measure weight, blood pressure, cholesterol and fasting blood sugar. The challenge aims to demonstrate measurable improvement in as little as one week, with typical results including weight loss and cholesterol level and blood pressure improvements.

""We have abundant evidence that consuming a whole-food, plant-based diet is the best way to reduce and, in some cases, reverse symptoms of chronic disease, including obesity, hypertension, high blood sugar and elevated cholesterol,"" said ACLM President Dexter Shurney, MD, MBA, MPH, FACLM, DipABLM. ""This challenge is an excellent on-ramp for individuals to learn what's possible by changing their lifestyle and how their fork drives day-to-day wellbeing.""

As part of the challenge, participants can attend the world premiere screening of ""The Game Changers"". Executive-produced by James Cameron, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jackie Chan, the film documents the explosive rise of plant-based eating in professional sports, mixing real-time, groundbreaking science with cinematic stories of struggle and triumph. The film features some of the strongest, fastest and toughest athletes on the planet, with additional EPs including Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton, top-ranked tennis player Novak Djokovic, and nine-time NBA All-Star Chris Paul.

""Our hope is that 'The Game Changers' will help the people of Pittsburgh put some dangerous myths about meat and protein to rest,"" said the film's producer James Wilks, ""while helping them understand that a plant-based diet is the healthiest and strongest way to eat.""

After the seven-day challenge, participants will be coached by the Engine 2 team for 10 weeks to help each person adapt the lifestyle to his or her needs, monitor results and track improvement. Three-month screenings also will be conducted to study the long-term effects of the campaign.

Move somewhere else, and you’re unlikely to have a drastically different experience than you do here.

But if you’re a Black Pittsburgh resident, your health, education and employment prospects trail those of just about any other comparable U.S. city, according to Pittsburgh’s first report assessing inequality across both race and gender.

“What this means is that if Black residents got up today and left and moved to the majority of any other cities in the U.S., automatically by just moving their life expectancy would go up, their income would go up, their educational opportunities for their children would go up as well as their employment,” said study co-author Junia Howell, an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Pittsburgh.

The report, conducted by a team of Pitt researchers, was released Tuesday by Mayor Bill Peduto’s office and the city’s Gender Equity Commission.

Examining data related to health, education, poverty and employment, the research team created a new tool — the Index of Ranked Livability — to assess how race and gender groups compare to one another in Pittsburgh and to those same groups in other cities. The team compared Pittsburgh to nearly 90 other U.S. cities with both substantial white and Black populations.

For example, the report found that Pittsburgh’s rate of infant mortality for Black babies is more than six times higher than it is for white babies — 13 deaths per 1,000 births compared to two deaths per 1,000 births. The report also found a significant wage gap among adults. Black and other non-white women earn between 54 and 59 cents for every dollar a white man in Pittsburgh makes.

“[T]he reality is that if we don't reckon with the inequality in Pittsburgh and that it's much greater than the vast majority of cities in the U.S., we are not only not making the city livable for our Black residents but all of us,” Howell said.

At a press conference Tuesday afternoon, Peduto reflected on the city’s maternal and infant mortality rates among Black women and babies and called for change.

The report found that maternal mortality among Black mothers in Pittsburgh was worse than a vast majority of comparable cities.

“We have rates within our Black community that are Third World when it comes to infant mortality, and there shouldn't be anyone in the City of Pittsburgh that can accept that fact and not be asking, ‘What am I doing?’ or, ‘What is my company doing?’ and ‘What is my organization doing?’ in order to change it,” Peduto said.

When asked why health, education and employment outcomes were worse for Black residents, in particular Black women, compared to white people, Gender Equity Commission Executive Director anupama jain offered a simple explanation: “Sexism and racism.”

“Unfortunately, many Americans and this includes Pittsburghers, have the mistaken belief that we do have a level playing field,” jain said. “Unfortunately, we have to build equity. When we assume it exists, we are doing a great disservice.”

Here are some key findings from the report:

Pittsburgh has a high maternal mortality rate for Black women and a high rate of homicide for Black men. The study concluded that, “Black adult mortality rates are higher in Pittsburgh than in 98 percent of similar cities.”

Pittsburgh has low college admission test scores and high rates of police referrals for all students, compared to other cities. The report notes that police referrals are “disproportionately affecting Pittsburgh's Black children and have a lasting impact on their educational attainment and economic well-being.”

Black women and children are more likely to live in poverty in Pittsburgh than in comparable cities.

The report looked at “occupational segregation,” a phenomenon where one group is more likely to hold a certain type of job than another group. For example, a high concentration of Black men work maintenance jobs, while a high concentration of white men work in construction. Researchers found that Pittsburgh has high occupational segregation for Black men but low occupational segregation for white, Asian, Latinx and Native women.

The city’s Black girls are less likely to drop out of high school or college once they begin, though fewer Black girls in Pittsburgh go on to college than Black girls in other cities. Pittsburgh also has a comparably high rate of graduate degrees among Black men and all Asian, Latinx and Native people.

The Gender Equity Commission was formed by City Council legislation in late 2016 and assembled in March 2018. Among the commission’s primary charges was completing the gender equity study presented Tuesday. Beginning in November and continuing throughout 2020, the Pitt researchers and GEC will issue three more reports. The second report will examine inequities among city employees; the third, based on focus group research, will recount residents’ “lived experiences with inequities”; and the fourth will recommend specific policies the city and other institutions can implement to begin undoing the inequities.

While a later report will offer specific policy recommendations, the report released Tuesday makes broad recommendations to start solving some of the inequities it highlights. For example, the report noted that Black women’s high maternal mortality rates “are not the result of Black women's lack of access to prenatal health care” and their unemployment and poverty “are not explained by their educational levels.”

Rather, the report notes that Black women have poor outcomes because “of the individual and structural racism and sexism they face.” Regarding maternal mortality, the report says the high rate for Black women is caused by “health care providers' stereotypes of Black women that influence diagnoses and care” and stress related to racism.

“Pittsburgh should consider targeted interventions that address the racially discriminatory biases in the health care system, increase the number of Black health care providers, and reduce broader socioeconomic inequities faced by Pittsburgh's Black women,” according to the report.

One of the study’s authors, Dr. Liz Miller, a Pitt professor and director of adolescent and young adult medicine at UPMC Children’s Hospital, noted that she was currently engaged in research and other work to lower Pittsburgh and Allegheny County’s rates of infant and maternal mortality. She said she’s currently engaged in a study that is seeking to find specific ways to prevent infant and maternal deaths.

""I feel like all of the players within our city and county are at the table really rolling up our [sleeves] and saying, 'Okay, all hands on deck,' these data are absolutely unacceptable,"" Miller said.

The report calls into question Pittsburgh’s status as “a most livable city.” The city has earned the “most livable” label from publications like Forbes magazine and The Economist and both Peduto and former Mayor Luke Ravenstahl have used the designation to promote the city.

“The City of Pittsburgh has been called one of the most ‘livable’ cities in the United States,” the report said. “However, this title is based on rankings that do not consider whether Pittsburgh is ‘livable’ for all residents.”

Peduto, at the press conference, praised the researchers for providing the city with this data so that it can address the problems it highlights. He said he wants to create an “equal playing field” for all Pittsburgh residents.

“There's a lot of poverty in the City of Pittsburgh, and we deal with the symptoms of the poverty, but we have a great opportunity if we take this data and are able to give people an opportunity for an equal playing field,” Peduto said Tuesday. “That's all, just an equal playing field so every person has that potential in life.”

The ceremonial break ground kicked off at PPG Arena West Lot, revealing what to expect when construction is finished.

High ranking PA officials expect to reconnect Downtown and the Hill District to reflect growth in Allegheny county.

“The Cap will be transformative by removing a physical barrier and re-establishing connectivity to centers of employment, education, and services in Downtown,” states Pittsburgh’s Sports & Exhibition Authority.

The project will cost an estimated $32 million, receiving funding from Pennsylvania Commonwealth — including a $19 million grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation.

“We are proud to have been partners on this project at the state, and to provide funding to propel this important project forward,” said State Senator Jay Costa, Jr.

The Cap will encompass Washington Place, Centre Avenue, Chatham Street, Bigelow Boulevard and other surrounding areas.

“[It] will be a great community amenity as well. Construction on the Cap and the adjacent redevelopment will make this part of our city more walkable, more livable, and more sustainable,” said Congressman Doyle.

The contemporary three-arced greenspace will feature accessible walkways, bike lanes, murals from local artists, lower ambient temperatures and rain gardens for stormwater management.

It will also include more housing, offices, retail/entertainment, and hotels.

Work will begin at the end of June 2019.",[]
https://www.wesa.fm/post/city-pittsburgh-opens-hazardous-and-e-waste-recycling-drop#stream/0,['Pittsburgh'],City Of Pittsburgh Opens Hazardous And E-Waste Recycling Drop-Off,"A drop-off site for hard-to-recycle electronics and hazardous waste opens Wednesday in the Strip District. The city of Pittsburgh initiative will be located at 3001 Railroad Street near the 31st Street Bridge.

There are special regulations for how electronics and things like chemicals must be recycled, and disposal options have been limited in Pittsburgh for a long time. As part of the contract with Environmental Coordination Services and Recycling, Pittsburgh residents will have to make an appointment to drop off waste, either online or by calling 814-425-7773.

""That's for a couple reasons,"" said Alicia Carberry, operations manager in the office of Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto. ""To manage capacity, to receive special instructions and to give a run through of what people can expect.""

Carberry said she doesn't think that will keep people from recycling.

""I think that as people get used to this it will become kind of commonplace,"" Carberry said. ""You make the appointment, it's a ten minute chunk that you'll sign up for, you go drop your stuff off and be on your way.""

But Justin Stockdale, managing director of the Pennsylvania Resources Council, thinks it will pose more of a challenge for residents. He said the price point will also likely deter some people: most materials will have some fee for drop-off, such as 40 cents per pound for a computer monitor.

""Any barrier we place out there between the customer and the final disposition is going to cause some inconvenience, and there will be some in the community that will see that as a step too far and will not utilize the service,"" Stockdale said.

However, he said this is a great first step for recycling these items in the city.

""It does demonstrate a real commitment on the city's part to finding better solutions for some of these challenging materials,"" Stockdale said.

Hazardous and e-waste recycling for Pittsburghers was announced in December, with a proposed start in January.

The city plans to expand the program this fall to include at home pick-up by appointment, as well as recycling events in some neighborhoods.

The drop-off site will be open Wednesdays from 3 p.m. to 8 p.m. and Sundays from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.",[]

An energy use analysis will be released annually as the city works to meet its climate goals.

Pittsburgh’s Climate Action Plan aims to cut city-wide carbon emissions and energy use in half by 2030. To help reach that goal, Council passed an ordinance in 2016 that requires all non-residential buildings over 50,000 square feet to share that data.

The law only affected four city-maintained buildings, but officials decided to look at all 154 in order to be transparent with taxpayers and lead the way in the reporting initiative, said Grant Ervin, Pittsburgh’s chief resilience officer.

“It’s about … improving operations over time,” he said. “Understanding what those consumption patterns are allows us to have a good insight in terms of making improved capital and operating decisions.""

Changes could include anything from buying electricity from renewable sources and better insulating buildings to replacing cooking equipment in fire halls with more efficient models.

The City County Building on Grant Street is the biggest energy user by far. The upside of discovering just how energy-hungry buildings are is that there’s plenty of room for improvement, said Ervin.

Pittsburgh is one of a growing number of cities to pass energy use disclosure ordinances in recent years. Ervin estimated that roughly half the buildings required to comply with the law have done so. There’s no penalty for failing to disclose the information, but Ervin anticipates continued information-sharing as owners see lower bills and learn about opportunities to get financial help in making retrofits.",[]

But what about the rest of the city? - PublicSource,"This story is part of Covering Climate Now, a global collaboration of more than 250 news outlets to strengthen coverage of the climate story. Read PublicSource's stories here.

Listen to this story

The City of Pittsburgh set a goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 50% by 2030. The objective is the centerpiece of the city’s third climate action plan, passed in 2018.

Over the past two years, Chief Resilience Officer Grant Ervin has been trying to show how the city can meet the mark. His plan focuses on increasing the energy efficiency of city buildings, procuring more green energy and building out an electric vehicle fleet.

The city now owns 19 electric vehicles and is preparing to turn its entire lot on Second Avenue into the city’s first large-scale electric charging lot. If the city continues to implement his recommendations in its upcoming budget, he expects the municipality's emissions to fall by about 19% by the end of 2020.

But while the city is taking the lead, it hasn’t yet kicked off one of its most important strategies: pressuring the biggest buildings in the city to stop using so much energy. And there isn’t a plan yet for how to reduce the next biggest source of emissions: energy use in people’s homes.

Sitting around a conference table with his four-member team, Ervin expressed optimism. “If we make the moves we have in concept now and the ones close to being in queue, the city’s operations will hit its targets. I’m pretty confident about that,” he said. “Are you, guys?”

“Not with business as usual,” responded Flore Marion, the city’s energy advisor. “But with the plan we are laying.”

Because climate change legislation has stalled nationally, many advocates believe the biggest hope for progress right now is at the local level, including in cities like Pittsburgh. Mayor Bill Peduto pledged as much during a public clash with President Donald Trump right before the city released its latest plan.

The plan

Marion recently finished a report analyzing the energy use in all 154 of the City of Pittsburgh’s buildings. So instead of just randomly picking which buildings to target, the city can focus on the least efficient ones first.

Marion’s report showed that Firehouses 22 and 34 are the least efficient: they use more energy per square foot than any other firehouse in the city. So if the city wants to get the most bang for its buck, focusing on those two buildings first will save the most energy and the most money in the long run.

To start, Marion expects to work on renovations of about 10 buildings per year. In the long run, this will save the city $1.3 million per year once the city has cut its energy use in half. There is no special climate change fund or separate accounting for costs associated with the efforts. But the city budgets a certain amount of money each year for building renovations, and the hope is to use that money to drive down its yearly energy costs.

“We’re looking at what’s the long-term benefit and implications, not just the quick and easy fix but how do we structurally fix the building to make it a higher-quality, higher-performance structure,” Ervin said.

The city’s buildings represent a fraction of the city’s total energy use. Most of the change will have to come from the city’s private businesses and institutions and, right now, it’s not clear which ones to focus on.

Ervin has received two years of energy data from around 500 of the city’s largest buildings, four of which are owned by the city, and Marion said she will finish analyzing the data by the end of the year.

“We don’t want to just release the data and have building owners feel discouraged about their performance,” she said. “The goal is to support people and make them aware that once you realize your building is poor performing, there is a system out there to save money and energy.”

Many buildings have already formally joined together in a special 2030 District pledge to reduce their energy use by 50%. More than 500 buildings are committed to these reductions. Many of the member buildings in Oakland and Downtown have been committed for more than five years. The University of Pittsburgh, for example, has prioritized 25 buildings for energy retrofits between 2018 and 2020; lighting is being upgraded at the Petersen Events Center and there are planned changes to the Cathedral of Learning and the Chevron Science Center to name a few.

Last year the university also agreed to purchase hydroelectric power from a new plant on the Allegheny River near the Highland Park bridge. The plant will supply the university with about 25% of its power starting in 2022. Not only will the university be using less energy, but the energy it does use will result in fewer greenhouse gases.

The city is preparing to follow suit, said Sarah Yeager, the city’s energy planner. The city was already purchasing 35% of its power from green sources but most of the money it was spending on green energy went to companies in places like Texas and North Carolina. That played “more of an accounting function” for renewable energy that is already built, Yeager said, and didn’t incentivize companies to build more green energy capacity here. She said the city will be ready to buy local green power within a year.

While Pittsburgh has some of the country’s greenest buildings, in places like Phipps Conservatory and at Frick Park, some developers still haven’t gotten the message, Ervin said.

“So, when you have affordable housing developments, developments in Lawrenceville, just building a building, a box to put tenants in, but not thinking about the implications,” he said, “you are building for yesterday rather than building for tomorrow.”

Housing

One of the biggest gaps in the city’s current plan is how to address the city’s aging housing stock, which accounts for more than a quarter of the city’s total climate emissions. The city needs homeowners to do what the city is doing: get an energy audit of where energy is being wasted and then invest in efficiency upgrades.

Conservation Consultants, Inc., [CCI] a nonprofit that currently audits about 120 homes per year, launched a competition in August to see which Pittsburgh homes could reduce their energy consumption the most. There are cash prizes and an online tool to compare homes.

But to enter the contest, homeowners need to first spend $400 on an energy audit. Even Ervin said that is a tough ask, particularly because the audit could then recommend many thousands of dollars in upgrades.

In some other states, there are better incentives for homeowners to invest in more efficient energy, said Lucy de Barbaro, the manager of market services for CCI. “And those can be substantial rebates, and people are moved to act. And we don’t have it here,” she said. “We are frustrated with not being able to mobilize larger populations.”

Individuals have until the end of October to sign up for the CCI competition, but a few weeks after CCI announced the contest, only 11 of the more than 130,000 households in the city had signed up. That won’t be enough to move the needle.

The city is supposed to have reduced its greenhouse gas emissions 20% by 2023, to be on pace. But the most recent data, from 2013, shows the city’s total emissions (not only the municipal emissions) were up 10%.

The city’s climate work is changing the way the city does business, Ervin said. But it won’t be enough if more businesses and residents don’t follow suit.

“The challenge is to expand the scale and growth in these areas,” Ervin said. “We all need to do more.”

Every year since 1998, the city's human resources department compiles a report showing employee demographics and work-related complaints. The report covering last year, the 2018 Equal Employment Opportunity Plan, was released June 3.

That report shows gaps remain when it comes to the percentage of women and people of color working city jobs compared to the city's demographic makeup. The reasons for those gaps are not discussed in the study.

For example, while Cincinnati is roughly 52 percent female, according to the U.S. Census Bureau's 2017 American Community Survey five-year estimates, about 31 percent of the city's municipal workforce is made up of women. The city itself is about 42 percent black, but the city's workforce is 32 percent black. And while roughly 3.6 percent of the city's population identifies as having Hispanic origins, only about .6 percent of the city's workers identify that way.

The demographics are somewhat different for the city's part-time employees. Fifty-five percent of part-timers with the city are black, the report shows.

The report also shows that disciplinary action brought against employees was disproportionate to the makeup of the workforce. Of the 278 disciplinary actions taken by the city in 2018, 64 percent went to black employees. Most of the employees disciplined — 77 percent — were men.

Twenty employees filed 22 state and federal equal opportunity complaints against the city last year. Fourteen of those complaints — equally split between black and white and male and female employees — were filed directly with the federal government. Another eight complaints — all from black and all but two from female employees — were filed with the Ohio Civil Rights Commission. Details about the nature of those complaints are not included in the report.

The report shows that promotions also don't line up with the makeup of the city's workforce, at least when it comes to men and women. Only about a quarter of the 410 promotions given by the city last year went to women. About 39 percent went to black employees, however — higher than their representation in the city's workforce.

The study, which is required by an ordinance passed by Cincinnati City Council, contains more detailed information about the demographic makeup of various city departments, as well as applications received by the city and hiring data from 2018.

The city received more than 26,000 applications for employment last year. Forty-nine percent of those who applied were white and 41 percent were black. Other applicants identified as Hispanic, Asian, Native American or two or more races. Forty-five percent of those who applied were women, while 54 percent were men.

The applicants who were hired, however, were reversed — 49 percent of all new hires by the city last year were black, while 41 percent were white. Forty-eight percent of those hired from that applicant pool were women, while 51 percent were men. But full-time hiring still doesn't line up with the city's demographic makeup. Of the 211 full-time positions the city hired for last year, only 32 percent went to black applicants. Roughly 40 percent went to female applicants.

The report also has some interesting information about the generational makeup of Cincinnati's municipal workforce. So-called Gen-Xers make up the largest portion of the city's workforce at 42 percent. Baby Boomers make up the next largest share of the workforce — 27 percent — followed by Millennials, who represent 26 percent of the city's workforce. So-called Gen-Z workers already make up about 3.8 percent of the city's employees — a large enough percentage to make the rest of us feel kind of old.

""Our mission is twofold,"" Cincinnati Human Resources Director Joe Wilson writes in the report. ""First, we want to ensure that the City of Cincinnati continues on the path of a more diverse and inclusive workforce. We can make strides through better recruiting efforts, and ensuring that everyone has equal opportunities as it relates to promotional and other job opportunities.

Council made several changes to Mayor John Cranley's proposed budget, including restoring funding to several outside organizations, creating a new funding category for legal aid organizations, restoring funding for the director of the city's Office of Environment and Sustainability and the city's bike program, and other additions.

A veto-proof majority and, many times, all council members voted for the ordinances, adding $1.5 million for those groups on the budget's operating side. Some of that spending, including $750,000 for nonprofit Center for Closing the Health Gap, was opposed by Cranley and City Manager Patrick Duhaney.

The money for the additions and funding restorations comes from roughly $881,000 left over from this year's budget, plus adjustments to holiday pay for incoming police recruits (totaling about $220,000) and other sources.

The votes effectively close out the city's budget process, which also included a series of public hearings, ahead of the end of the fiscal year June 30.

""I don't think anyone is happy with everything, but I do think it's a good structurally acceptable budget,"" council member David Mann said today. Mann chairs council's Budget and Finance Committee.

Council member Greg Landsman said the budget boosts several key priorities for the city, including basic public services, pedestrian safety, eviction prevention and other vital services.

""What this budget isn't is where we need to be long-term,"" Landsman said. ""I don't think anyone is comfortable with the amount of revenue coming into the city and the fact that we're under-investing in key infrastructure... we're under investing in our departments. I do believe that in the next year or so we're going to have to make some difficult decisions about transforming this budget, because we can't keep doing what we're doing, which is cutting and cutting and cutting.""

Part of the shortfall comes from long-running cuts to the state's Local Government Fund, which have cost the city tens of millions of dollars over the past decade. The Ohio Senate has suggested boosting somewhat the state's contributions to that fund, and the city expects to see roughly $2 million more from the state this year.

Operating Budget

Groups and offices receiving funds under council's budget changes:

• The Center for Closing the Health Gap: $750,000

• Office of Environment and Sustainability: $175,000

• Economic Inclusion Wage Monitoring: $140,000

• Office of Aging and Accessibility: $111,000

• Bethany House: $100,000

• Hillman Accelerator: $100,000

• Chemical Addiction Treatment (CAT) House: $41,250 above the $46,250 in Cranley's proposal

• Cincinnati Human Relations Commission: $20,000

• Urban Agriculture Program: $20,000

• City Clerk's Office funding restoration: $19,000

• Invest in Neighborhoods: $12,500 above the $37,500 in Cranley's proposal

• Neighborhood games: $10,000

As in past years, there was some debate about the way the city funds human services. The United Way's Human Services Advisory Committee oversees much of that funding, but other groups, including the Center for Closing the Health Gap, get money outside of that process. The city still vets those organizations, some council members say, but others, like council member Amy Murray, say the city should move all human services funding into United Way's wheelhouse.

Council did move to create a new category for legal help under the United Way-administered funding process. That category would include Legal Aid Society of Greater Cincinnati and the Ohio Justice and Policy Center, both of which currently get funding from the city. Council added the Immigrant and Refugee Law Center to that category and provided $50,000 in funding for the nonprofit.

Capital Budget

Council also added $663,500 in spending on the budget's capital side funded by extra money from closed out projects and tax increment financing district proceeds.

That money would go to restore cuts in funding to:

• City of Cincinnati bike program: $251,000

• Neighborhood Business District Improvement Program: $112,500

• Neighborhood Transportation Strategies: $111,000

• Electric vehicles for city departments: $96,000

• Over-the-Rhine Museum: $75,000

• ArtWorks mural funding: $18,000

Among the biggest winners in council's budget changes is the Center for Closing the Health Gap. As it was last year, the group's funding was cut under the city manager's and the mayor's budgets. Council also restored its funding last year.

The nonprofit, which saw a large number of supporters turn out to advocate for restoration to funding during the city's budget hearings recently, works to bridge health disparities experienced by Cincinnati's black residents.

The nonprofit has been in the news recently after texts released by the city showed that former Cincinnati mayor and Health Gap founder Dwight Tillery was communicating with five Democratic Cincinnati City Council members about the ouster of City Manager Harry Black, FC Cincinnati's West End stadium, Health Gap funding and other city business.

Cranley has said that the Health Gap should go through the same process overseen by the United Way of Greater Cincinnati that other nonprofits apply to in order to get city funding.

To celebrate July being National Parks and Recreation month, personal finance website WalletHub evaluated data from a number of categories in order to calculate which cities have the best recreation.

Photo via WalletHubAccording to the website, ""One of the best ways to maintain an active lifestyle is to choose a city that encourages and facilitates recreation. The best cities have a wide range of leisure activities, both indoor and outdoor. Those activities require varying levels of exercise and contribute to a city’s overall well-being and economy.""

The ranking system considered 48 metrics for 100 of the largest cities in the United States. Those 43 metrics were divided into four main categories which included entertainment and recreation facilities, with metrics like hiking trails per capita, bike rental facilities per capita, food festivals per capita and music venues per capita; costs, which included metrics like spending on parks and recreation, average fitness club fee and average food cost; quality of parks which included metrics like share of the population with walkable park access and presence on TripAdvisor's ""Top 25 Parks"" list; and weather, which evaluated the city's ideal weather.

Cincinnati came in at No. 7, just after Atlanta and right before Scottsdale, Arizona. San Diego ranked No. 1 and coming in at the bottom of the list at No. 100 was Jersey City, New Jersey.

According to Cincinnati Parks' website, our city parks span over 5,000 acres, with parks, nature centers, overlooks and more stretching from the riverfront to the suburbs. We have a nationally ranked zoo, aquarium, plenty of outdoor and indoor recreation entertainment options and a comparatively low cost of living, which helped to rank our city in the top 10.

At least, it stands there for now. The team purchased Revelation Missionary Baptist Church at 1556 John St. in May, and on July 3, applied for a demolition permit for the building. That application was approved this week.

The church congregation's leadership says it welcomes the move to a new church constructed by the team in North College Hill. But historic preservationists — and Cincinnati City Council member Chris Seelbach — have mounted an effort to save the German gothic-style, 154-year-old religious structure, an early home to reform Judaism in Cincinnati and the place where famed civil rights leader Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth once preached.

Seelbach yesterday filed an application with the city's department of planning to get local historic landmark designation for the property. The Cincinnati Historic Conservation Board and City Planning Commission will consider that application and make recommendations before council gives final approval.

Because the demolition permit has already been granted, the designation alone wouldn't save the building — FC Cincinnati would have to miss the six-month window it has to use its permit and reapply for the historic designation to have an impact. Chances that the effort will be able to stop the demolition are slim. But Seelbach says it's still important to try and protect the building and recognize its significant place in Cincinnati history.

According to the historic designation filing, Jewish congregation The Society of Brotherly Love constructed the John Street Temple in 1865 for $47,000 after having worshiped in two smaller locations in the Over-the-Rhine since 1848. The congregation is responsible for another local landmark — the Jewish cemetery on Ludlow Avenue in Clifton, which they established the same year they formed.

It took 27 years for the congregation to buy the leased land the building stood on from descendants of early Cincinnati leader David Wade, and 33 years to pay off the construction debt.

Today, only the Lodge Street Synagogue on Ruth Lyons Way — constructed in 1861 — is older than the John Street Temple. Cincinnati's iconic Plum Street Temple downtown was built the year after John Street.

The Society of Brotherly Love counted among its members many influential Cincinnatians, and famed father of American Reform Judaism Isaac Wise preached there on a number of occasions. The synagogue followed Wise's lead and converted to Reform Judaism from its orthodox roots in 1871.

But by 1904, only about 40 congregants remained with the society, and they decided to sell the large John Street building. They eventually merged with another congregation and constructed a new temple together on Reading Road.

A German Lutheran congregation purchased the building for $15,000 that year and held services in German for the large number of immigrants who had made the city's urban basin their home. The church underwent a $5.000 restoration a few years later which included the addition of new stained glass windows.

But demographic changes saw many of those Germans leave the West End over the next two decades, and in 1927, the church changed hands again. This time, an African-American congregation called the Revelation Baptist Church moved in. Revelation started in 1921 and worshiped out of nearby rented spaces before congregants Horrace and Melvina Sudduth bought the church for $27,000. Sudduth was a prominent member of the African-American community best known for owning and running the Manse Hotel in Walnut Hills. The next year, the Sudduths transferred the property to the church.

The church grew in importance in the black community, and, at the height of his Civil Rights work in the south, Rev. Shuttlesworth preached there from 1961 to 1966 before starting his own church in Avondale. In 1965, 5,000 civil rights activists marched from the church to the Hamilton County Court House to demand equal rights for African Americans.

The building received a significant addition in 1976, which covered part of the original facade with a concrete block structure.

Revelation held onto the church until its sale to FC Cincinnati. The congregation there voted 49-5 to sell the building to the team and approached FC Cincinnati about the deal, according to church leadership. The church will continue to worship at the building until it moves to a new facility constructed by the team on West Galbraith Road. Some of the building's historic stained glass windows and other features will likely be moved to the new site.

""For some time, our church has been interested in opportunities to minister in a new church building located in a new neighborhood that could increase the worship experience of our congregation and promote the growth of our congregation,"" church Board Chair Walter Collier said in a statement. ""We are excited about the opportunity this presents to our church and look forward to increasing our membership at our new church building.""

The team would like to demolish the building and other structures around it as it makes plans for development north of its coming stadium. But Seelbach and historic preservationists believe it should be saved.

The historic designation filing points out that few historic religious structures remain in the West End due to urban renewal demolitions that took place in the late 1950s and that the building is a prime example of early Germanic religious architecture in the city.

""1556 John Street’s current congregation is a long-standing Black Baptist church which has called this building their home for nearly 100 years since 1928,"" the historic designation filing reads. ""The three congregations which have called this building home have marked it as a powerful reminder of Cincinnati’s patterns of urban change.""

https://www.citybeat.com/news/blog/21067488/efforts-underway-to-craft-a-housing-strategy-for-cincinnati,['Cincinnati'],Efforts Underway to Craft a Housing Strategy for Cincinnati,"Nick SwartsellCould Hamilton County’s thousands of vacant lots and homes help solve the area’s affordable housing shortage? That’s one idea groups launching an effort to draw up an overall housing strategy for Greater Cincinnati are looking into.

Local Initiatives Support Corporation Greater Cincinnati, the Greater Cincinnati Foundation, Legal Aid, the Port and community engagement firm Cohear are compiling data and public input to design a series of recommendations that could guide policymakers as they seek to address the big gap in affordable housing in the county.

Cincinnati hasn't had an overall housing strategy since the 1980s, LISC Greater Cincinnati Executive Director Kathy Schwab says — something potential funders ask about when the subject of funding solutions to the region's housing problem comes up.

“For people living in poverty, where they live and where they work are fundamental,” GCF Vice President of Community Strategies Harold Brown told Cincinnati City Council’s Budget and Finance Committee today. “So we embrace quality affordable housing as a real focus point in our work. We give lots of grants for folks who are doing great work in the housing space… but what we notice is that they’re very disjointed. There is great work going on in isolated pockets. Everyone is asking what’s the strategy, what’s the overarching plan for improving this issue in our community? And frankly, there isn’t one.”

Housing is affordable when residents living in it spend no more than one-third of their income on rent or mortgage and associated costs like utilities. Currently, Cincinnati needs roughly 30,000 more units affordable to low-and-moderate income residents. The county overall needs about 40,000 units, according to a study LISC completed in 2017.

The question is how best to address that problem. That’s what the effort, funded by GCF, PNC Bank, the Mayerson Foundation and JP Morgan Chase, looks to do.

One answer might be funding rehabilitation of vacant properties to add more housing stock in the region. Schwab says that when the organization commissioned its 2017 study, it found that the county has thousands of vacant parcels — land or empty buildings that could be used for housing.

“So we spent all of last year, with a grant from JP Morgan Chase and a bunch of data interns, inventorying about 10,000 parcels in the county,” she told a Cincinnati City Council committee today. “By my simple math, if we have a huge housing gap, why can’t we put families in these vacant homes? So we’ve started the quest to find funding to do that.”

Other cities like Detroit, Charlotte and Nashville have drawn up an overall strategy for meeting affordable housing needs and used it to raise money to address the problem.

Detroit raised $250 million for its housing strategy, Schwab said, pulling from city dollars and federal Community Development Block Grants, as well as contributions from banks and community foundations. The city is using the money for mixed-income development and rehabbing blighted properties into low-cost single-family homes.

Cincinnati’s strategies might be different, Schwab says — something that will come to light as the work on a housing strategy continues.

“It’s not just about money,” she said. “It’s about policy. We have issues around eviction. We have issues around homeless camps. There are a lot of things that could be addressed around this plan.”

The policies will be on Cincinnati City Council and city administration to piece together. Council member Tamaya Dennard says there are areas that may come into play there, including a reassessment of how the city hands out property tax abatements for development.

“The onus is on us to create policies,” she said. “You can fix the here and now, but if you don’t have the policies, you’ll be right back here.”

Council member Chris Seelbach said he hoped that the effort would reveal more about at what price points efforts are needed.

“Low-income housing is incredibly important,” he said. “We don’t have enough of it in the city. But I also don’t think we have enough workforce housing — housing for people who are making $30,000 to $60,000. They can’t afford $1,500 a month in rent, but maybe they can afford $600 or $700.”

Schwab says a lot of the details — what price level the city and county should focus on, how much money will be needed and other issues — will emerge as research continues.

LISC hopes to have a housing strategy recommendation incorporating four to six focus areas ready by the end of the year. That’s also when Cincinnati will need to present a consolidated plan — an assessment of housing and development needs — to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, which doles out key federal funding for housing and community development projects.

The effort should involve large amounts of public engagement, Schwab says.

“This is not our plan,” she said. “This is for the community. We’re just here to provide the funding and to put the boots on the ground.”",[]

Cincinnati is one of the most immigrant-friendly cities in the U.S., according to a new study.

The Queen City ranked No. 18 out of 100 U.S. cities in the latest index by New American Economy (NAE), a New York-based research and advocacy coalition. The index scores the country's largest metro areas on a 1-5 scale based on several factors, including job opportunities, legal support and livability.

Cincinnati received a 3.48 composite score. It earned a perfect score on civic participation, which reflects the percentage of naturalized citizens among eligible immigrants, as well as public-sector, social-sector and military service workers.

The coalition credited the Cincinnati USA Regional Chamber, among other local organizations, for its efforts to attract and retain foreign-born talent.

The city's lowest score was a 2 out of 5 on inclusivity, which is determined by municipal policies that influence hiring practices, zoning ordinances, access to community colleges and social services, among others.

According to the report, Cincinnati is the top major city in Ohio for immigrants and the third-highest scoring city in the Midwest. Other Ohio cities that made the list include Cleveland at No. 64, Columbus at No. 70 and Toledo at No. 82.

NAE plans to update the report annually to track developments in municipal and socioeconomic policies.

Best city for new citizens?

The index comes on the heels of a similar study by Boundless, a Seattle-based immigration services organization, which ranked Cincinnati No. 8 on its list of the best cities in the U.S. for immigrants seeking citizenship.

Opinion: We're among the top cities for integrating immigrants

That study, which relied on data collected between July and December 2018, scored cities on the following factors:

Backlog completion (total applications filed, processed and backlogged)

Median wait time

Distance to field office

Cincinnati received an overall score of 86. Cleveland topped the list, earning a composite score of 95 for its low median wait times and high backlog completion.

https://www.startlandnews.com/2019/06/kansas-city-urban-tech/,['Kansas City'],KCMO advancing action plan with focus on digital equity in urban tech,"Kansas City is one step closer to being a fully connected hub for urban tech, as local decision makers craft a smart city action plan.

“That document will be what guides all of our future investments in technology,” explained Chris Hernandez, KCMO communications director.

The action plan comes a year after the city issued a request for proposal regarding smart city technology, Hernandez noted, adding citizens have remained curious about the city’s developments in urban tech.

“There’s a group that has been put together to create the action plan and the stakeholder interviews started last week,” he said of city progress. “… We’re hoping to roll that out mid-fall.”

Announced days after the election of Quinton Lucas — who is expected to become the 55th mayor of Kansas City in August — the decision to move forward with the smart city action plan was not dictated by politics, but rather timing, Hernandez emphasized.

“It was really about our RFP committee, which is staff with a council representative — as all RFPs have — it was about really evaluating the proposals … but also thinking really deeply about what we want as a city and what we need to do to move forward,” he said.

As Kansas City ramps up its urban tech efforts, the action plan is what will help the city maintain its status as a leader in the smart city space, noted Hernandez.

“We really think this is an opportunity to show other cities how you can make sure that you are pushing smart city technology and thinking deeper into the organization — to the department level, to the program level, to make sure that it’s being used to be more efficient, to deliver better basic services.”

A key component of the city’s RFP surrounding smart city technology was digital inclusion, Hernandez added.

“If you want to take it back to the mayor elect [Quinton Lucas], he’s made it clear that inclusivity is super important … and beyond the phrase ‘digital inclusion,’ it’s really about ‘digital equity,’” he said. “That’s an important distinction that maybe only people who really study that issue understand, but something that we are highly aware of and we have had many people on staff level digging into that issue already.”

Addressing the digital divide, Hernandez cited free public WiFi in downtown as movement that resulted in the same action on city buses — a step in the right direction for the city’s connectivity efforts, which will soon include the Prospect Max corridor which will focus on inclusion on the east side.

Ensuring smart solutions make life easier for residents and simplify basic services will be in key in the city’s approach to urban tech, Hernandez said.

“If you have good streets, good pipes, good infrastructure, and we are using proper data management to make sure that we’re getting that feedback so that we know how to better use our resources — which is your tax money — in order to run our city and fix the infrastructure … that’s what we’re trying to do with this action plan,” he explained.

(Reuters) - Record flooding along the Missouri River has impaired treatment of drinking supplies in Kansas City, raising health risks for infants, the elderly and others with compromised immune systems, the municipal water service warned on Saturday.

The Kansas side of the Missouri River is seen in Atchison, Kansas, U.S., March 22, 2019 in this still image taken from a video obtained from social media. SHAWN RIZZA/via REUTERS

The public health advisory came as utility crews struggled to replace broken pumps at a wastewater treatment plant submerged by floodwater about 30 miles upstream in Leavenworth, Kansas, an historic town of 35,000 on the river’s west bank.

The crest of the flood-swollen Missouri, America’s longest river, rolled through Leavenworth on Saturday. Miles of farmland and wooded areas along both banks were inundated in murky brown water. It was expected to reach Kansas City, Missouri, the state’s largest municipality, early on Sunday.

By Saturday, high water was creeping to the edge of the scenic commercial district in Parkville, Missouri, a riverfront suburb of 6,700 residents just upstream from Kansas City known for its antique shops, art galleries and restaurants.

Nevertheless, flooding in the immediate days ahead was not expected to reach the catastrophic scale seen in Nebraska and Iowa to the north, as excess flow continued to dissipate along the length of the river.

Charles B. Wheeler Downtown Airport, situated on a river bend behind a tall levee in the heart of Kansas City, Missouri, expected no flood-related disruptions, an airport official said.

Drinking water in the city became an issue even before the flood crest arrived. The KC Water utility, which serves 170,000 mostly residential customers with water drawn from the river, said it had failed to meet “enhanced treatment technique standards.”

TAINTED DRINKING WATER?

Testing showed excessive levels of turbidity, fine particles in the water that can carry bacteria, viruses and parasites including Cryptosporidium, which can cause diarrhea.

KC Water spokeswoman Brooke Givens said Cryptosporidium itself has not been detected, but “the state requires us to notify customers” whenever testing shows the treatment system’s filters are failing to control turbidity.

The high volume of rain and snow melt runoff flowing through the Missouri has carried excessive silt and other material, changing the taste of the water in recent weeks, Givens said.

“With all that runoff, we’re seeing river conditions like we haven’t seen in more than a decade,” she told Reuters.

KC Water said the diminished water quality was not considered an emergency but advised customers with compromised immune systems, the elderly and those with infants to seek medical advice before drinking tap water.

Floods were unleashed when last week’s “bomb cyclone” storm dumped torrential rains atop hundreds of square miles of the snow-covered Plains.

Record flows cascaded into the Missouri River watershed, and flooding killed at least four people, drowned livestock and closed dozens of roads across a wide swath of Nebraska and Iowa. Property losses were estimated at more than $3 billion in those two states.

U.S. President Donald Trump declared a major disaster on Saturday for 56 Iowa counties, making federal recovery assistance immediately available. He issued a similar declaration on Thursday for Nebraska.

The engorged river crested higher at a record level of over 32 feet (9.75 meters) on Friday at the waterfront city of St. Joseph, Missouri, forcing some 7,500 people to flee from low-lying areas.

Evacuation orders were lifted as floodwater receded on Saturday. But the river in Leavenworth on the Kansas side just downstream crested at 31.4 feet, the second-highest on record there after a 1993 flood in which the river topped 35 feet.

Leavenworth Police Chief Patrick Kitchens said workers and volunteers were sandbagging a riverfront community center converted from a 19th-century rail station to protect the building from floodwater.

A bigger concern, he said, was the town’s flooded wastewater treatment plant.

Fort Leavenworth, a U.S. Army garrison in town that ranks as the oldest permanent settlement in Kansas and houses a military prison complex, escaped serious damage, though its air field was under water, base spokesman George Marc said.

He said the garrison has no regular flight operations and had already towed the few private planes kept on base to higher ground.",[]
https://www.kcur.org/community/2019-05-28/westports-new-master-plan-calls-for-shorter-buildings-and-wider-sidewalks,['Kansas City'],Westport's New Master Plan Calls For Shorter Buildings And Wider Sidewalks,"A new master plan intended to guide the future development of Westport over the next 20 years proposes height restrictions along its primary streets, wider sidewalks and potential historic designations for nearby neighborhoods.

The Westport District Master Plan is in response to concerns two years ago over two large apartment proposals and follows 18 months of work by a steering committee representing key Westport constituencies.

“We’d love to see this go forward to protect what we see is special about Westport,” said Ken Kimbrough, executive director of the Westport Regional Business League.

Kimbrough was one of several people speaking in support of the master plan prepared by Gould Evans at a City Plan Commission meeting last week.

The commissioners voted unanimously to recommend approval to the Kansas City Council. It’s expected to be considered by the council’s Planning, Zoning & Economic Development Committee on June 5.

While the Westport master plan is advisory, it ultimately could be the basis of mandatory regulations for Westport including a potential special overlay district, spot rezoning and historic designations for buildings and districts.

“We feel what you see before you is a good compromise that preserves what’s good about Westport and allows it to grow and change,” said Lisa Briscoe, executive director of Historic Kansas City, the city’s primary historic preservation organization.

Rendering from Opus Development

It was concerns by Historic KC, City Councilwoman Kathryn Shields and others over two big apartment proposals in 2017 that prompted the master plan.

While Westport always has been considered one of the city’s most popular historic districts, it had no comprehensive guidelines to evaluate new development.

One of the apartment developments, a 256-unit, six-story building at the southeast corner of Westport Road and Broadway currently is being built by Opus Development Group.

The other, Westport Terrace at Manor Square, remains in the development stage. It calls for 205 apartments and a 120-room hotel in seven- and nine-story buildings at the north end of the existing Manor Square garage between Mill Street and Pennsylvania Avenue.

A temporary moratorium on additional development was established by the city council at the request of Shields to allow time to inventory Westport buildings and prepare a master plan.

Proposed height restrictions would limit future development along the core streets of Westport to three stories. That limit would be applied to Westport Road between Southwest Trafficway and Baltimore, and Pennsylvania between 40th Street and Mill Street.

Image from Gould Evans

The three-story restriction also would apply to surrounding neighborhoods.

Buildings up to six-stories would be allowed outside those areas, and property controlled by St. Luke’s Hospital on the south edge of Westport along 43rd Street, now employee parking lots, could be developed up to 10 stories.

Development that respects the plan’s height restrictions also is encouraged on the many parking lots within Westport’s boundaries.

Another master plan recommendation concerns what it calls public spaces, which in the case of the tightly contained, 176-acre Westport community, primarily means sidewalks and streets.

The plan recommends that sidewalks be widened and vehicle traffic lanes be restricted throughout much of Westport. It also suggests a public square to be developed at the intersection of Westport Road and Mill Street.

The plan calls for sidewalks along Westport Road from Southwest Trafficway to Baltimore be widened to 15 feet where possible and travel lanes remain at 10 feet. It recommends improved pedestrian amenities including trees, benches and trash receptacles.

For Pennsyvlania, it recommends expanding sidewalks to 10 feet, maintaining the 9-foot travel lanes and improving pedestrian amenities including adding benches.

Where Broadway passes through Westport, the plan calls for Broadway to evolve toward more balanced, multiple modes of transportation including bicycles and advocates a minimum of 10-foot sidewalks and traffic lanes consistent with its boulevard status.

The plan also suggests the intersection of Broadway, 40th Terrace and Washington Street be reconstructed to narrow the street.

The plan for Mill Street calls for extending access to Dr. Jeremiah Cameron Park, a small green space northwest of 43rd Street and Broadway, by building a bicycle/pedestrian path from where the street dead ends near its intersection with Pennsylvania.

Map by Gould Evans

As for historic preservation, which is a controversial subject particularly in Westport’s commercial areas, the master plan took a more cautious approach.

Properties within a formal historic preservation district have strict limits about altering their exterior appearance, a restriction that many business owners have resisted.

The proposed master plan documents Westport properties officially currently designated as historic and suggests additional properties and districts that could be eligible for historic designation.

It supports formal designation for any historic building or district, but recommends priority be given to creating historic districts for two residential neighborhoods, Whittier Place and South Roanoke.

Without striking a deal, the city has closed its RFP in a search for a private-sector partner to serve as a “program manager” for smart city projects.

“We decided that first we need to create a ‘smart city action plan’ to help us make sure we know what kind of governance structure would best guide our smart city implementation in the future,” said Chris Hernandez, director of communications for Kansas City. “This will create a more permanent way of incorporating smart city work into our daily operations.”

In June of last year Kansas City issued an RFP as a first step in its efforts to locate a private-sector partner to design and build a “full integrated suite of sensors, networks and data and analytics platforms,” according to the document.

“All RFPs are, by their nature, a way to see what the market has to offer,” Hernandez reflected in an email.

“We discovered that there are a heck of a lot of great ideas out there for expanding smart city programming and technologies,” he added.

The city has decided to move forward with its smart city planning “without selecting a business partner from the proposals we received,” said Hernandez.

The “action plan” Hernandez referenced is expected to be released this fall.

“Our most important goal is to implement smart and innovation solutions at all levels of our operations, and to push smart city thinking and technology deeper into our organization, our business practices and our delivery of basic services,” said Hernandez.

Kansas City, with a population of nearly 492,000 within a metro region of about 2.2 million residents, stands as a smart city icon among medium-sized cities. Its former Chief Innovation Officer Bob Bennett would often describe downtown as “the smartest 54 blocks in the United States.” The area was outfitted with a honeycomb of connected technology such as traffic and other sensors all communicating with one another to make urban life hum along more efficiently.

A new 2.2-mile downtown streetcar line only added to the district’s curb appeal and transportation options. Plans are already in place to extend the route another 3.5 miles.

The city is also moving forward with an expansion of the sort of smart city network deployed in downtown along Prospect Avenue, where the region’s transit agency is developing a bus rapid transit route, with sensor and other infrastructure being installed as that work unfolds, said Hernandez.

All told, smart city and transit improvements along the Prospect Avenue — an area with about 80,000 residents — will deploy some 600 traffic sensors and about 60 informational kiosks.

“Our regional bus system RideKC (KCATA), has already lit up free public Wi-Fi on all buses, including along Prospect,” said Hernandez.

“We want to make sure that Kansas City continues to lead on smart city innovation and technology, driving the use of data for City Hall decision-making, operating the city more efficiently, and improving the lives of our residents,” he added.

If Kansas City fully implemented its bike plan, local businesses would benefit from $500 million in increased spending and more than 700 lives would be saved over the next 20 years, according to a new study, which bolsters the case that urban areas should fully invest in better cycling infrastructure.

The researchers from the University of Missouri Kansas City analyzed a range of benefits that would result from the city’s plan to increase biking to 1.5 percent of total trips in the city by bike by 2024 and 5.5 percent by 2035 by adding 350 miles of protected bike lanes, shared use paths, recreational trails.

“This research confirms how essential a quality bike network is to so many city goals: safety, health, economic opportunity, and fiscal sustainability,” Thomas Morefield, BikeWalkKC’s director of community planning, said in a statement. “These are benefits for the entire community, not just those who bike. We can only realize these benefits if we implement the plan, so the hard work is just beginning.”

The study assumes bike infrastructure will result in safety improvements on some of the Show Me State’s most dangerous city streets. Those are expected to reduce injuries and fatalities 17 to 47 percent, in line with results from other road diet projects around the country. That would result, they say, in 15 fewer crash deaths annually. In addition, researchers estimate there would be 15 fewer deaths from inactivity and six fewer from air pollution.

Researchers Michael Frisch and Joshua Boehm say bicycling can also offer substantial benefits to the local economy. People who bike frequently tend to own fewer cars — 0.7 fewer per household on average, according to the National Household Travel Survey. That adds up to pretty substantial savings. According to government data, households with two cars spend 19 percent of their budget on transportation compared with 12 percent for one-car households. Some of that savings, the study assumes, would be reinvested in the local economy, instead of in cars and gasoline, which is mainly imported.

Overall they estimate the effects would lead to about 12,600 jobs (job years) and $500 million in additional investment by 2050. The transportation savings, improved environment, reduce traffic injuries and increased local spending would generate about $400 in benefits per household.

""Let's spend the money where things are really needed, not where people don't want them,"" Larry Riggle, a resident, said.

For some neighbors, the condition of Johnson Road is more of a concern than building a new bike and walking path next to it.

""Obviously this is our natural drain so they're going to have to completely redo the drainage,"" Riggle said.

Riggle says their sidewalks were also just updated and ADA accessible curbs installed a few years ago. The city would have to tear that work up to make room for a proposed ten-foot wide asphalt-paved ""Johnson Road Trail.""

""I think it's a waste of money. There's been sidewalks here; people use them every day,"" Riggle said.

The project connects the 71st Street Trail and the Fall Creek Greenway on the northeast side and creates a safer, protected lane for bikers. But neighbors who have signed this petition say it's not necessary and the area doesn't call for it.

Scales agrees and says her district hasn't received this little of money to resurface roads in 12 years.

""If you have a city councilor in a district saying that this is a poor use of taxpayer dollars, why move forward with that project?"" Scales said. ""Well, I would say the first thing is that local dollars that go into federal projects like this doesn't actually come from our road budget.""

The director of the Department of Public Works says about three-quarters of the $1 million price tag this project will cost is coming from the federal government. The nearly $300,000 the city is putting in to match it is separate from the road resurfacing budget and wouldn't be used to fill potholes anyways.

""Construction is frustrating, but when the project is done, it's going to be something that we hope that each and every resident on the northeast side uses,"" Dan Parker, DPW Director, said.

The project was granted federal funding back in 2014. The DPW directors say call the Mayor's Action Center to report a pothole, and they'll get to it according to priority.

https://www.theindychannel.com/news/politics/city-of-indianapolis-removing-9-million-pounds-of-dirt-from-former-industrial-site,['Indianapolis'],City of Indianapolis removing 9 million pounds of dirt from former industrial site,"INDIANAPOLIS — Thanks to a grant from the state of Indiana, a former Indianapolis industrial site has new hope for redevelopment.

The ground at the former Colonial Bakery site near the intersection of 24th Street and Winthrop Avenue is contaminated with heavy metals and petroleum compounds.

It was used for warehouse storage, truck loading and truck repair from the 1950s through the 1990s.

“It is indeed vital the city of Indianapolis does all it can to remediate the soil that was home to those industries for such a long period of time,” Mayor Joe Hogsett said Wednesday.

The city is in the process of removing about 4,500 tons of soil, or about 9 million pounds. About two feet of surface soil will be removed, to a depth of two feet below grade, the city said.

Even the asphalt on the site will be removed.

“This will bring the spot we stand on up to residential standards and prepare it for redevelopment,” Hogsett said. “The effort – a necessary effort – will nevertheless also be costly.”

To pay for the remediation, the city received a $345,000 grant through the Indiana Finance Authority.

The soil removal is expected to be completed by the end of the month, and the RFP for the site will be released either late 2019 or early 2020.

Indiana officials who recently discovered an error in the state's road-funding distribution formula are shifting millions of dollars to the city of Indianapolis at the expense of other cities and towns.

Indianapolis is projected to see a net gain of about $12 million for road projects next year, an increase of about 23% from 2019.

But the change also means every other Indiana city and town, including local government units within Indianapolis that operate independently, will see an 8% reduction in their allotment of certain road-funding dollars. The decrease will impact local government budgets starting next year.

""Cities and towns in every county will be impacted,"" said State Auditor Tera Klutz. ""The important part was that they are all in budget prep right now, so it's important for them to know.""

The complication dates to 1970, when the Indiana General Assembly approved the formation of Unigov, which merged the governments of Indianapolis and Marion County.

State law says Indiana's auditor should use the population within what is identified as the fire special service district — the geographical area that the fire department covers — to calculate the distribution of certain tax funds instead of the entire consolidated city's population.

The district further expanded in the mid-2000s to include five more townships. But as the state auditor's office was preparing for the 2020 census this summer officials realized that the road-funding formula had not been updated to reflect the fire district's larger population.

Indianapolis could receive as much as 80% more than was initially expected from the Motor Vehicle Highway Account, one of two state funds that will be affected by the change, Klutz said.

City leaders said they are pleased about the increase but warned that it still won't be enough to address all of Indianapolis' ongoing infrastructure problems.

""It is significant relevant to what we were receiving,"" said Thomas Cook, chief of staff for Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett. ""It is not so significant to address the underfunding of our road infrastructure.""

The additional dollars are not currently included into next year's budget, Cook said, but officials will look to add them after January once they receive the first distribution. It's unclear how those extra dollars will be used.",[]

Indianapolis will host a national civil rights conference this summer that proponents hope will promote unity, heighten diversity in local businesses and raise awareness about economic inequality.

The National Urban League, along with its local chapter and Mayor Joe Hogsett, announced Wednesday that the city will host the organization's annual conference beginning July 24. The four-day conference, returning to the city after a 25-year hiatus, is expected to draw thousands of people.

Hogsett said the conference is taking place at a critical time when the nation appears divided. President Donald Trump the day before called for unity during his second State of the Union address, but Democrats in the Capitol were unimpressed.

""It is indeed appropriate that we come together this summer as one city, as one country, unified for progress — equitable progress for all Americans,"" Hogsett, a Democrat, said Wednesday.

The Rev. David Greene, president of Concerned Clergy of Indianapolis, lauded the National Urban League conference as a great opportunity for Indianapolis, saying the league could push the city's leadership to improve diversity in business ownership, the local economy and participation in city contracts.

""When you consider all the work and money being spent in our city, you'd like to see a lot of minority companies participate in the building of these items,"" he said. ""There's a lot going on, so if the Urban League can help facilitate or address that, it would be phenomenal.""

Economic impact

National Urban League President and CEO Marc H. Morial said his organization estimates that the conference could have at least a $10 million economic impact, depending on attendance. That figure includes spending on taxis and ride shares, hotels, restaurants and other goods.

Visit Indy, which uses its own method to calculate economic impact, says it projects the conference could generate about $4.2 million over its four-day stretch. The city's tourism arm is expecting more than 4,000 registered attendees from across the U.S., with an additional 16,000 Central Indiana residents visiting the conference's exhibit halls.

For comparison, the National Rifle Association's 2014 convention drew more than 75,000 people. The annual gaming convention GenCon attracted more than 220,000 people last year and generated $75 million in direct spending.

Indianapolis won the bid for the National Urban League conference due to strong support from the business community and local politicians, its quality hotels and facilities, and the local organization's ability to execute the convention, Morial said.

'United Not Divided'

Morial said the dual goals of equality and unity for the conference, which is themed ""Getting 2 Equal: United Not Divided,"" are significant given the upcoming census and presidential election.

""We have been dismayed by the efforts we've seen from the nation's top leadership to sabotage the constitutionally mandated method by which political power and resources are apportioned,"" he said in a written statement. ""'Getting 2 Equal: United Not Divided' serves as our declaration of commitment to a fair Census and a fair election and to achieving equity in education, jobs, health care and housing.""

Last month, a federal judge blocked the Trump administration's plan to add a citizenship question to the 2020 U.S. Census, USA Today reported. States, immigration and civil rights groups filed several lawsuits against the administration, accusing it of attempting to weaponize the survey against immigrant communities.

Chrystal Ratcliffe, president of the Greater Indianapolis NAACP, praised the Urban League's work locally and nationally.

Income equality

Hogsett said the organization can help cities like Indianapolis by guiding dialogue to building a more equitable future.

""Our city is experiencing growth and investment like few times in its history,"" Hogsett said. ""It's our priority to make sure that the good-paying jobs and the sustainable growth touches every neighborhood, touches every ZIP code, touches every resident of Indianapolis. Any economic success that fails to address inequality cannot rightly be called a success.""

Indianapolis doesn't rank among the best or worst states for income inequality, according to a Brookings Institute analysis of household income inequality in the 100 largest U.S. metro areas and their most populous central cities from 2014 to 2016. The analysis, which uses data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey on median household income, found that only 5 percent of Indianapolis households earned more than $172,135 per year in 2016 while less than 20 percent of households earned less than $19,598 per year.

Founded in New York City, the National Urban League provides economic and educational opportunities to underserved urban communities through programs, public policy initiatives and advocacy.

This year's conference also will include a one-day Small Business Matters Entrepreneurship Summit as well as a gathering called Tech Connect, which brings together innovators influencing racial justice and social change through emerging technology.

Speakers will include actress and choreographer Debbie Allen, retired Los Angeles Lakers player Norm Nixon and actress Vanessa Bell Calloway. All declared major-party presidential candidates also have been invited to address the conference.

The National Urban League Conference is one of several conferences expected to take place in Indianapolis this year and next. Leonard Hoops, Visit Indy president and CEO, said the National Rifle Association will meet in Indianapolis in April.

""That's an interesting juxtaposition with the NRA in April and the Urban League in July,"" Hoops said. ""There's a lot of people who will celebrate one or the other, but not both, because of political lines and all these other things, but Indy welcomes all.""

Tell us about it, and we might dig deeper for a Here & Now story as part of our ""Going To Waste"" series.

Indianapolis is the largest city in the country without a universal curbside recycling program, according to The Indianapolis Star. So, it may come as little surprise to learn that just 4% of the city's garbage is recycled each year.

Without universal curbside recycling, residents in Indianapolis have to either go somewhere to drop off their recycling, or pay an $8-a-month subscription fee to have someone come and pick it up off their curb — a system that has frustrated residents, according to Allyson Mitchell, executive director of the Indiana Recycling Coalition.

""We take phone calls, and we get confusion, perplexion, and we do hear some anger from people,"" Mitchell says. ""Especially when they move from other parts of the country and they come to Indianapolis, they expect to see the same level of services that they had in other cities of our size, and when they come here and realize that they have to pay extra and take an extra effort to recycle, they're frustrated.""

Of Marion County's approximately 267,000 households, only 10% are enrolled in the subscription program, making up about 26,000 households, according to Katie Robinson, director of the city’s office of sustainability.

She doesn't necessarily look at the city’s low recycling rate as a black eye, but rather as an opportunity for Indianapolis to grow a program that fits its needs. Robinson says Indianapolis hopes to implement a citywide curbside recycling program by 2025 — and she sees an urgent need to do so.

""We actually just completed the city's greenhouse gas inventory and our emissions from waste is continuing to grow rather rapidly,"" she says. ""It was kind of striking to see that increase, and so, we are very concerned.

""We need to get some of that waste processed accordingly.""

Robinson says Indianapolis hopes to tackle its food waste problem as well, by eventually offering a subscription-based composting service to residents. For both programs, though, the city needs to move strategically, she says.",[]
https://www.theindychannel.com/news/local-news/city-of-indianapolis-looking-into-ipls-rate-hike-proposal,['Indianapolis'],City of Indianapolis looking into IPL's rate hike proposal,"INDIANAPOLIS—In a rare move, the City of Indianapolis plans to be a player in an IPL rate hike proposal pending before state regulators.

Friday, the city filed a ""petition to intervene"" with the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. Attorney Anne Becker has been hired by the city to take a close look at the proposal which would raise customer bills over a seven-year period.

The commission has been holding public hearings on IPL's plan and is likely to issue a decision early next year. Now, in addition to considering what was said at the hearings and what has been filed the with IURC, commissioners will also hear the city's position on the plan.

""Our energy grid is a critical asset, and the long-term quality of life in Indianapolis depends on IPL continuing to invest in and maintain the infrastructure that powers our community,"" said Mayor Joe Hogsett in a press release from the city. ""As a city, we also have an obligation to ensure that any required upgrades do not unfairly burden working families in Indianapolis. Through this process, we will work to ensure that the price of this multi-year project, and costs passed through to ratepayers, are no higher than absolutely necessary.""

The petition to intervene states: ""Indianapolis has interest in the impact IPL's proposed increase in rates and charges and its continuing utility operations may have upon the City, the local economy, or economic development, and upon the citizens of Indianapolis.""

As the petition points out, the city is also an IPL customer, ""and pays IPL substantial amounts for electricity used by street lights, traffic control signals, municipal buildings, and municipal operations. The City also has a direct interest in the cost and quality of IPL electric service. Therefore, the City has substantial interest in the outcome of the proceedings and will be directly affected by the findings, rulings, and orders made by the Commission in this cause.""

The IPL plan would mean an average customer bill increase of $10.50 per-month by 2027.

Whether the city will recommend a lesser rate hike is what attorney Becker, described by the city as a ""seasoned utility lawyer,"" will decide.

When asked for a response to the city's action, IPL Director of Community Relations Tonya Sovinski said, ""the City of Indianapolis is a strong community partner and customer. At this time, we do not have an official comment as we are in the midst of Regulatory proceedings.""",[]
https://www.smartcitiesworld.net/news/news/columbus-implements-single-payment-platform-across-different-mobility-services-4506,['Columbus'],Columbus implements single payment platform across different mobility services,"The platform can be used for both public and private mobility services

The platform can be used for both public and private mobility services

The US city of Columbus is launching its first publicly managed single payment platform across different transportation modes.

Siemens Mobility is working with its partially owned subsidiary, Bytemark, to provide a common payment solution for Columbus’ Smart Columbus trip planning app. It allows for both public and private mobility services to be paid using a single account-based payment system, making it much easier to undertake multi-leg trips.

This payment system will fulfil the back-end payment portion of the trip-planning capabilities currently provided on the open-source Smart Columbus OS platform.

Range of mobility services

The payment for the entire journey (such as public transit and cab fares) is occurring just once, with the respective fares automatically routed to the right services. The payment platform will integrate all mobility provider payments, spanning both public and private mobility options, as well as multiple modes including bike-share, scooter-share, and ride-share.

“The beauty of such a system is that you can plan – and pay for – your trips more holistically now,” explained Michael Stevens, chief innovation officer for the City of Columbus. “Instead of checking to see which mode is faster, you can actually map out the fastest multi-mode route – utilising any/all modes of public and private transportation, including bicycles, scooters, buses, and ride-hailing. And then pay for it all just once at the end.”

He added, “this solution truly brings first mile-last mile solutions into the hands of the consumer.”

Joanna Pinkerton, president and CEO at Central Ohio Transit Authority, said mobility integration is the key to providing greater access to a higher quality of life. “Bringing multiple modes of transportation together and providing a way to pay for an entire trip on one platform, is paramount to bringing innovation and efficiency in the way we provide more access to jobs, education and health care in our communities,” she said.

“Instead of checking to see which mode is faster, you can actually map out the fastest multi-mode route – utilising any/all modes of public and private transportation”

One scenario where commuters could benefit is traffic congestion along their typical commute home. With this new all-in-one app, users can identify whether bus, train or Lyft, for example, would be faster and then see how those or other options (bicycle or scooter) can take them home for that final mile. Once they choose the optimal route, they can pay for the entire trip at one time.

“What is really exciting is how this account based MaaS application will empower citizens of Columbus with more opportunities for seamless door-to-door travel options based on one common payment platform,” explained Marcus Welz, president of Siemens Mobility’s intelligent traffic systems in North America and CEO of Bytemark.

“We have also been working with exciting new technology partners, such as PayNearMe, which provides walk-in retail options for cash payments, finally making it possible for people to upload cash into their account. This opens up access for a whole new group of travellers – previously limited by banking options – to experience today’s newer travel options and capabilities.”

Smart Columbus is a joint initiative of the City and Columbus Partnership, which is utilising government grants and private investment for mobility projects to improve the region’s transportation system. The goal is to act as a living lab and document a working plan and playbook for other metro areas to follow.

https://www.columbusunderground.com/columbus-development-corridors-morpc-bw1,['Columbus'],"Study Recommends Dense Development, Better Transit for Five Corridors","The West Broad Street corridor — Photo by Walker Evans.

Nearly five years ago, the Insight 2050 initiative helped to shine a light on the challenges that Central Ohio will face as a predicted one million new people move into the region.

Today, with growth continuing at its highest rate yet — about 120 people are moving into the region every day — a new study has been released that provides a strategy for managing that growth.

If the Insight 2050 study asked the question, “can we stop the sprawl?” the just-released Corridor Concepts study provides an answer; “yes, but we have to change the way we do things, and we have to act fast.”

The Columbus region could accommodate more than half of the predicted growth by adding denser development and faster, more reliable transit options along just five of its major corridors. In order for that to actually happen, though, the many different jurisdictions in the region will need to cooperate, zoning and land use policies will need to change, and a major push will be needed to carve out space along each of the corridors for “high-capacity transit.”

The five corridors examined in the study are:

East Main Street: SR 256 to Downtown Columbus

Northeast: Polaris Parkway to Downtown Columbus

Northwest: US 33 at Post Rd./Frantz Rd. to Downtown Columbus

Southeast: Rickenbacker International Airport to Downtown Columbus

West Broad Street: Norton Rd. to Downtown Columbus

“These are good representative samples, out of probably ten (corridors) we could have studied,” explained Yaromir Steiner, the founder and CEO of Steiner + Associates and the co-chair of the Corridor Concepts initiative, along with City Council President Shannon Hardin. “Even just those five could absorb 50 to 60 percent of our future growth – saving woods and forests and farms – and that would (also) increase the tax revenue by three times per acre.”

The final report, which was officially unveiled today, goes into great detail about the financial, environmental, and general quality of life benefits of focusing growth along existing corridors.

Steve Schoeny, the Development Director for the City of Columbus, said that it’s important to realize that those financial benefits extend to ordinary people – when more workers can easily get to job centers without owning or relying on a car, that creates what amounts to a pay raise for thousands of people.

Transportation options, traffic congestion, and access to jobs are also big issue for companies looking to locate or expand in the region.

“Companies look at the Columbus region and they say ‘what are the long term risks for us as an employer?'” said Schoeny. “Because at the end of the day, our most important input to our process is our people… and if you never know what’s going to happen on the road network, and the road network is the only thing we have to rely on, yeah, that’s a long term risk that the companies are going to take into account.”

“So this is not just about looking to manage growth,” he added, “but also dealing with what now is a real and present danger to our economic competitiveness.”

The study does not assume that most people in the region will give up their cars and switch to riding the bus or walking everywhere. Under the “focused growth trajectory,” the projected transit use for people who live within one of the corridors is eight percent (compared to one and a half percent under the “current trajectory” model). But even that relatively small change in mode share would mean a significant reduction in vehicle miles travelled for the entire region.

Similarly, the density that is recommended for the corridors is not extreme – the corridors will not be developed with skyscrapers, but with a mix of mid-rise buildings, a variety of housing types, commercial businesses, and even industrial uses.

One big question that is not answer by the Corridor Concepts report, though, is exactly what form the recommended “high-capacity transit” should take.

That’s an issue that the Central Ohio Transit Authority (COTA) will lead on, according to President and CEO Joanna Pinkerton.

“What’s really important at this point is that we all acknowledge a fundamental shift to high capacity,” she said, which means committing to providing physical space along each of the corridors that is dedicated to transit instead of single occupancy cars. “We cannot afford the current model, and it’s unfair to place such a significant cost burden on the individual household.”

Although the report lists several different transit options as possibilities, it does not appear that light rail will be a top priority moving forward. Included on the corridors map is an abandoned rail line running roughly parallel to Cleveland Avenue – which could be used if it proves difficult to obtain right of way along the street – but Pinkerton seems to be squarely focused on Bus Rapid Transit (BRT), which she said will become an even more attractive option as the technology supporting it improves.

The development of COTA’s CMAX line along Cleveland Avenue — the first BRT line implemented in Columbus — has led to an increase in ridership, she said, even without running in its own dedicated lane.

“We have already invested in Bus Rapid Transit here, and we’re seeing significant improvements… utilizing the existing road and our existing fleet, which was retrofitted to have connected vehicle technology,” Pinkerton said. “And we see communities that are investing in Bus Rapid Transit five and ten fold at the rate we are, and they’re having great success.”

“The mode (of transit) itself will have to be determined based on the cost and technology, and (by) the revenue streams and incentives that are decided by the community,” she added.

COTA has been working with the City of Columbus on a series of tactical urbanism projects, one of which is a temporary dedicated bus lane on West Broad Street. Several of those projects are now scheduled to be rolled out this summer and will serve as test cases, used both to gather data and to bring attention to transit solutions that could eventually be implemented on a larger scale.

William Murdock, Executive Director of the Mid Ohio Regional Planning Commission (MORPC), said that starting with something like BRT – rather than rail – would allow for more corridors to be developed at the same time, and for them to be built much more quickly.

“There’s an urgency to get in front of growth, and at the same itme, there’s only so much federal resources and state resources, so… not only do we need to do it, we need to do it quickly, and that lends itself to what can we afford, what’s efficient to do right now,” he said. “If you look at something like… high capacity rail, those are expensive, really lengthy projects.”

“Some of these corridors don’t have the density to support transit right now,” added Murdock. “So if we’re getting the right of way and we’re introducing, say, Bus Rapid Transit, and (the corridors) start to densify because we can move lots of people quickly, that might lend itself to other types of transit along the corridor as we go.”

The shortage of affordable housing is greatest at the lowest end of the income scale. In 2013, there were 57,000 “extremely low-income” renters competing for just 21,000 apartments available at rates they could afford, according to a 2017 report from the Affordable Housing Alliance of Central Ohio.

Rents are rising much faster than incomes, according to the report, and the segment of the population living in poverty is growing faster than the population as a whole. More than 28 percent of African-American residents in Columbus are considered severely cost-burdened, paying more than half of their income to rent, the report also notes.

On top of all that, more 10,000 housing units built in Columbus with federal subsidies have affordability requirements that expire in the next five years — just a slice of half a million more subsidized units facing that situation around the country, as Next City has reported.

The City of Columbus and Franklin County, Ohio, are now considering joining forces now to pilot a small community land trust in recognition of the need for permanently affordable for-sale housing for middle-income residents in changing neighborhoods. The Central Ohio Community Land Trust would launch with 30 or 40 homes, to be developed on vacant lots owned by the Columbus and Franklin County land banks.

The homes would be sold — or, really, leased — at prices that are affordable to households earning between $40,000 and $80,000 a year, according to a report in the The Columbus Dispatch.

Community land trusts work by holding the deed to land permanently and long-term leasing the improvements to residents. On land trusts that focus on for-sale housing, when residents move out, they split the equity on the improvements with the land trust, which then leases the home to another income-qualified resident.

The Central Ohio Community Land Trust would be the first community land trust in Columbus, with homes in four neighborhoods. Mayor Andrew Ginther announced in his “State of the City” speech last month that he would commit $3.8 million to establish the trust.

Steve Schoeny, director of development for the City of Columbus, says the land trust could be expanded in the future.

“We think there’s a lot that can be done with the concept of using a ground lease to preserve affordability, but we have to walk before we can run, much less fly, in terms of getting really creative with it,” Schoeny says.

The city and county land banks have worked together closely since the county land bank was created in 2012. Together, they own about 1,800 properties, according to Hope Kingsborough, vice president of programs & housing for the Central Ohio Community Improvement Corporation, which administers the county land bank.

In the last five years, according to a recent study, the city and county land banks combined have demolished 1,600 blighted buildings, helped find new uses for 1,300 properties, and reduced the overall level of vacancy in the city by 18 percent.

Kingsborough says that her organization spent the last eight months studying community land trust models and making plans for a Columbus version. That includes attending a training session last year with the Grounded Solutions Network, a national network of community land trusts, local governments, nonprofit organizations and others who support or work in inclusive housing and development.

The Central Ohio Community Land Trust will launch with properties that the city and county land banks already own — in neighborhoods where values are rising.

“I think it’s going to have a great impact,” says Curtiss Williams, president and CEO of the Central Ohio Community Improvement Corporation. “These neighborhoods themselves are going through a revitalization period. What our project will bring to it is the ability for mixed-income folks to buy houses in these neighborhoods as they go through this revitalization.”

In addition to $3.8 million for the Central Ohio Community Land Trust, which the city council is expected to vote on this week, the city is asking voters to approve a $1 billion bond package that includes $50 million for affordable-housing measures. Schoeny, the development director, says the city is working on a plan to prioritize that spending and is looking for consultants to help lead that process, which will involve the Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission and independent groups like the Affordable Housing Alliance of Central Ohio.

“We think that there’s great momentum around the affordable-housing issue, and we’re gratified that it has the focus it has and that folks are thinking about how to address it,” says Roberta Garber, executive director at the Affordable Housing Alliance of Central Ohio.

Garber notes that in order to address the scale of the affordable-housing shortage in Columbus, the city would have to come up with an astronomical bond number to pay for not just new and preserved housing but direct rental assistance to those earning the least.

“In the meantime,” Garber says, “$50 million is significant.”

Her group is looking forward to participating in the planning process.

“We’re always going to be the ones who remind folks that the group that still has the greatest need in our community are those with the lower incomes,” Garber says.",[]
https://www.govtech.com/fs/news/Columbus-Ohio-Takes-Multi-Strategy-Approach-to-EV-Adoption.html,['Columbus'],"Columbus, Ohio, Takes Multi-Strategy Approach to EV Adoption","COLUMBUS, Ohio — The rapid rise in the number of electric vehicles humming down the streets of Columbus is not an accident. The growth has been part of a deliberate four-year effort to accelerate next-generation mobility, not only for this city, but also for others like it.

Ohio's capital region has set a goal of increasing EV adoption five-fold. In 2015, less than half of 1 percent of cars sold there qualified as EV. The aim now is to get that number to more than 2 percent by 2020, doing so through growing partnerships with the car dealership community, local electric providers, businesses and others.

This strategy, guided by Smart Columbus, has led to a 121 percent increase in EV registrations from the beginning of 2017 to end of 2018, according to Smart Columbus statistics. This compares favorably to the 82 percent growth of EV registrations throughout the Midwest during the same period. There are also plans to install some 900 EV chargers across the metro region.

“The answer comes from multiple places,” said Norman “Bud” Braughton, Smart Columbus project manager for the city of Columbus, when asked how to describe some of the approaches the city has taken to increase EV adoption. “It’s the work we’ve done with the dealers. Because if the dealers didn’t have the cars, the people wouldn’t be able to buy them.”

Other stakeholders agree.

“The success came through creating a market,” said Zach McGuire, manager of Smart Mobility Adoption project at the Columbus Partnership, a business group leading the Smart Columbus project. “And that isn’t done through one silver bullet. It’s a collective approach.”

Smart Columbus was born four years ago when the region was awarded a $50 million Smart City Challenge grant by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT), which includes $10 million from the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation. The projects being pursued explore a list of technologies like connected vehicles, micro-mobility transportation and other approaches to address particular city needs around transportation.

Smart Columbus also opened a facility known as the Experience Center as a central location for public engagement in the form of showcasing electric vehicles, as well as serving as a workplace for the dozens of software developers and others involved in the various Smart Columbus projects.

When it comes to electric vehicles, the local government itself has transitioned some 200 of its fleet to EVs. And since electric cars require charging infrastructure, a large part of the project’s focus was the buildout of public charging ports, particularly in places of employment. American Electric Power, (AEP) a large electric utility in the area, is investing $9 million into a charging infrastructure pilot, which will likely inspire other utilities to make similar investments, said Smart Columbus officials.

“It’s rather pioneering in our state to have a regulated utility participate in charging infrastructure,” said Jordan Davis, director of Smart Columbus at the Columbus Partnership, speaking with Government Technology this week.

The initiative also looked at large companies and the efforts they could take to encourage EV adoption within their workforces. The Columbus Partnership focused on its 75 biggest members, all of which are large employers in the region. The Partnership worked from that membership base to create a program to encourage EV adoption as well as alternative transportation.

“A great example is a company like Chase,” said Davis, noting that the banking behemoth has some 22,000 workers in the region, with half of those at one location. “They had no charging infrastructure whatsoever.”

Chase is now in the process of installing chargers at all of its campuses in the region, as well as installing rooftop solar generation. And that's just one business. Smart Columbus also began working with car dealerships to ensure staff was well-versed on the ins and outs of electric cars, and that they were well-supplied with EV models.

There have also been many ride-and-drive events held at workplaces, festivals, community events and any other location with a captive public audience where Smart Columbus brought EVs for test drives.

“Everyone has dealers. That’s how cars are sold,” said McGuire, commenting on how other cities can copy Columbus’ EV strategy. “And when people are behind the wheel of a car, they’re more likely to buy the car. And people need to be educated on the technology.

“If there’s three things, I think it’s education, butts in seats and engaging in sales experience.""",[]

VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. (AP) — The city of Virginia Beach agreed to a $500,000 contract to clean a city building after a workplace mass shooting in May left 13 people dead, including the gunman.

The Virginian-Pilot reports that the city agreed to a no-bid contract to a worldwide property restoration company called Belfor to clean the building after the collection of evidence.

The company declined to comment on the contract or work, which has been completed. A spokeswoman told the newspaper the matter is too sensitive to discuss.

Eleven city employees and a building contractor died in the May 31 shooting.

Julie Hill, a city spokeswoman, says Belfor got the contract because the company already has one with the state for fire and water damage cleanup.

The serval was spotted Wednesday morning near the 2300 block of Shore Drive, according to city officials.

""[Animal Control] searched the area and found tracks, however, they weren't able to locate it,"" Virginia Beach officials posted on Facebook. ""The cat is believed to weigh about 25 pounds and has long legs, making it about 25 inches tall at the shoulders.""

A man who said he was the cat's owner replied to the city's Facebook post.

""That’s my cat. I left a voicemail thank you. He is not dangerous to children or dogs or other cats,"" the man commented. ""I don’t care if I get a fine. I just want to get him home and safe before something bad happens to him in a city with traffic.""

The city suggested neighbors not approach the serval.

""The cat may be social with humans, however Animal Control does not suggest anyone approach or interact with it,"" the statement continued. ""Instead, call Animal Control at 385-5000 and report where it was seen. This type of cat is known to eat small rodents such as mice and squirrels as well as small birds.""

https://www.wvtf.org/post/how-forests-help-mitigate-flooding#stream/0,['Virginia Beach'],How Forests Help Mitigate Flooding,"Trees are big money in Virginia, generating some $21 billion each year, according to the state department of Forestry. Another $6.6 billion is attributed to forest contribution to air and water quality.

Now, the city of Virginia Beach is looking at the value of the city's forests as one solution to their flooding problems caused by climate change and the region's sinking lands.

Pamela D'Angelo reports

Ironically, rain precluded a group of conservationists, scientists and Virginia Beach officials from meeting with reporters outside at one of the forests being studied in the Princess Anne District. Their biggest concern - southerly storms that not only create stormwater, but also a domino effect that pushes water from sounds to bays to tributaries and into low-lying neighborhoods.

Barbara Henley is a farmer and city councilwoman, whose family tree goes back generations in the area. She says flooding in her lifetime has been getting worse with climate change. ""We're a part of the Albemarle Watershed, so we have wind tides instead of the lunar tides that the Chesapeake Bay watershed area has and when we get a prolonged southern wind we get all this water pushed up here and it can't get out until the winds shift to the north.""

The city wants to consider solutions beyond stricter development regulation and expensive infrastructure flood controls like levees and tide gates. ""We're looking at all of this as part of our sea-level rise, recurrent flooding study,"" Henley said. ""One aspect that we discovered is that we've got a lot of neat forest land. I learned how to say evapotranspiration because they taught me this process that the trees take up a lot more water than they need and it goes into the air and it can be a component in our flooding strategies.

Virginia Tech is being brought in to study Virginia Beach and to locate forests and lands that work the hardest to reduce the risk and severity of flooding. The goal is to produce a tool that will help city officials identify best locations for reforestation and conserve forests that already sop up water. ""We're also getting evapotranspiration for unforested land uses, so we can also compare the difference what an urban system is doing - which is not much in terms of evapotranspiration,"" said Daniel McLaughlin, the lead scientist with Virginia Tech.

That's why urban areas with lots of roads, buildings and parking lots are referred to as heat islands. Think of a hot summer day walking across an asphalt parking lot to get into a building. Those areas can't release all that heat by evaporating water like a green space with trees and bushes can. ""Just like you perspire to cool your body, you cover the landscape. Just like you put a jacket on to take a run, you can't perspire, you can't cool yourself off,"" McLaughlin explained.

The city has had clashes with residents over more controversial solutions such as pumping water away from neighborhoods back into tributaries. ""There is no silver bullet,"" Barbara Henley admitted. ""One thing is not going to do everything and this idea of using trees or looking at trees is just one aspect of it. It's all a part of getting these potential tools examined.""

Like many other places around the Chesapeake Bay, the city is also considering one of the most difficult solutions - migration and relocation.",[]
https://www.governing.com/topics/urban/gov-charlotte-affordable-housing-lc.html,['Charlotte'],"Affordable Housing Crisis Reaches a Tipping Point in Charlotte, N.C.","Charlotte has a housing problem.

The largest city in North Carolina, home to a growing financial sector, is short 34,000 affordable housing units to meet demand, according to a city report released in late 2016.

With those challenges in mind, Charlotte has embarked on a comprehensive approach to create more affordable housing. Last fall, the city more than tripled the amount of money it asked residents to approve in bond funding for the city’s housing trust fund.

Typically, Charlotte has gone to residents every two years and asked for support in the form of $15 million in bond funding. But in 2018, Charlotte asked for and received voter approval for $50 million in bond funding.

The city will use some of its additional bond money to acquire property adjacent to transit and commercial centers, pair the housing trust fund dollars with federal Community Development Block Grant funds to create mixed-income housing, expand the development of rental housing through Low-Income Housing Tax Credits, and ensure that publicly funded developments set aside at least 20 percent of units for families earning less than 30 percent of the area’s median income.

Since the housing fund was created in 2001, the city has pumped more than $136 million into the construction of low-income housing through grants offered to developers to build the units. Across the city, more than 7,000 units have been built and rehabilitated since the fund was launched. More than 3,000 of those units are affordable to families earning less than 30 percent of the area’s median household income, or $22,250 per year.

The Tipping Point

Two events in recent years added a sense of urgency to the city's housing crisis.

The first was the 2014 release of a national report that ranked Charlotte dead last among the nation’s 50 largest cities in terms of economic mobility. According to the report, which was released jointly by Harvard University and the University of California, children who were born poor in Charlotte had less of a chance to escape their economic conditions than did children in cities such as Detroit, Milwaukee and New Orleans, where the poverty rates are more than twice as high.

Then in 2016, Charlotte police officers shot and killed an African-American man named Keith Lamont Scott; video footage of the shooting sparked days of protests across the city.

Pamela Wideman, director of housing and neighborhood services for the city of Charlotte, says the shooting and the economic mobility report were a tipping point. Together, the two events prompted officials to look at how poor residents, especially poor black residents, could be better integrated into Charlotte's economic growth.

The city and its surrounding county formed the Charlotte-Mecklenburg County Opportunity Task Force. The work of the task force culminated with a report released last summer, which called for a new, more multipronged approach to increasing affordable housing.

The city has attracted more than 100,000 new households since 2000, notes the report, titled ""Housing Charlotte."" That's led to a housing crunch, and the increase in housing costs has outpaced increases in wages.

""While significant progress has been made over the past decade to increase the supply of affordable housing in Charlotte, the reality is that housing is becoming less affordable,"" the report concluded.

'Put a Face on Affordable Housing'

“We never want to concentrate the affordable housing in one area,” Wideman says. “What we should always do is create mixed-income neighborhoods.”

That's not always a welcome proposition. Cities can encounter pushback when they try to diversify the mix of housing options. That's why Charlotte has focused on humanizing the need for affordable housing.

""We are trying to serve people that come to work every day, our hospitality workers, our teachers, our firefighters, our police officers,"" Mayor Vi Lyles said last month in announcing a partnership between the city and Bank of America and other financial institutions to provide low-interest loans for approved people to rent or buy a home. ""We're growing, and what we are trying to grow are neighborhoods, good families, good housing -- whether you choose to rent or to buy,"" said Lyles.

City planning documents have also consistently focused on the need for housing options for teachers, firefighters and other lower-income residents.

“I think there will always be NIMBYism"" from residents who don't want affordable housing options in their neighborhood, says Wideman. ""One of the strategies is to put a face on affordable housing and change the way people talk about it. This is housing for the entry-level teacher or the entry-level public employee.”",[]
https://www.csrwire.com/press_releases/41939-City-of-Charlotte-Recognized-as-Champion-of-Trees,['Charlotte'],City of Charlotte Recognized as Champion of Trees – Press Releases on CSRwire.com,"LINCOLN, Neb., May 06 /CSRwire/ - The Arbor Day Foundation has announced today that the City of Charlotte has been awarded the Foundation’s Champion of Trees Award. This award recognizes a government entity, community-based organization, or partnership among such groups that has demonstrated exemplary leadership to develop and implement new policies and practices for municipal tree planting and care, natural area stewardship or arboriculture. The award will be presented on May 13 at an award reception for the City of Charlotte at the Charlotte Mecklenburg Government Center.

The City of Charlotte, North Carolina, is being honored for its Tree Canopy Preservation Program (TCPP) which preserves natural areas in the city through voluntary purchases or easements, paid for by fees collected from developers. Since 2014, the city has protected 221 acres, an area three times larger than what would have been protected through traditional tree preservation codes, and acquisitions are targeted for environmental attributes rather than left to developer choice.

“One of Charlotte’s most notable features are the stately, old trees that make up the city’s urban forest,” said Dan Lambe, president, Arbor Day Foundation. “Charlotte has one of the most expansive tree canopies in the country. We are proud to recognize the city’s creative and thoughtful approach to finding a sustainable way to allow the city to grow and still maintain its beautiful canopy.”

Community trees remove pollutants from the air, improve water quality, reduce stormwater runoff and lower energy use — providing economic and environmental benefits citywide. In the U.S., urban trees provide more than $2.4 trillion in environmental services. Charlotte has one of the most expansive tree canopies in the country, with 47% canopy coverage. The city receives more than $335 million in environmental benefits and services every year from its trees. The city wants to reach 50% canopy coverage by 2050 as part of its master urban forest plan.

Since 1972, the Arbor Day Foundation has recognized the inspiring and life-changing work of leading environmental stewards and tree planters through the annual Arbor Day Awards. Award winners from previous years include the late Nobel Peace Prize winner Wangari Maathai, Maryland Governor Martin O'Malley, the United States Forest Service and Procter & Gamble.

This award winner is one of six being honored for their outstanding contribution to tree planting, conservation and stewardship. The remainder of the 2019 Arbor Day Award winners will be presented with their award during their local Arbor Day celebrations. More information can be found at arborday.org/programs/awards.

https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/new-charlotte-transit-oriented-77650/,['Charlotte'],"New Charlotte Transit Oriented Development Regulations Approved, What’s Next?","The City of Charlotte has revamped its approach to Transit Oriented Development (TOD) as an initial step in the process of transforming the city into a liveable one that provides transportation options for all residents to access employment, services, and housing. As Chair of the Charlotte Unified Development Ordinance Advisory Committee (Advisory Committee), I was granted the opportunity to speak in support of the proposed TOD amendments at the public hearing in March 2019. After some revision, the Charlotte City Council approved the Text Amendment to the zoning ordinance provisions on TOD on April 15, 2019 and adopted new TOD regulations that reflect the considerable efforts of the Charlotte Department of Planning, Design & Development (Planning Department), the Advisory Committee, interested agency, industry and community stakeholders, and individual citizens who engaged in the process. The amended TOD ordinance and regulations became effective upon adoption, creating four new TOD districts designed to foster development of moderate to high-intensity, compact, mixed-use urban neighborhoods near transit stations. The new TOD districts are designated as TOD-UC Transit Urban Center, TOD-NC Transit Neighborhood Center, TOD-CC Transit Community Center, and TOD-TR Transit Transition.

So, what’s next for TOD and the Advisory Committee?

Translation & Alignment Mapping

We previously talked about the 2-phase process of translation and alignment mapping that would follow adoption of the new TOD regulations. As the initial step to bring existing zoning in alignment with the new TOD regulations, property that was zoned TOD-M, TOD-R, and TOD-E was translated to the new TOD-CC district upon adoption of the new TOD regulations. Between April 15th and June 30th, these translated properties have the choice to develop or redevelop under the previous applicable regulations if a zoning site plan has been submitted and accepted for zoning review by the City. After June 30th, all development will be governed by the new TOD regulations, with the exception of conditionally zoned development.

The Planning Department currently is tackling the second phase called alignment mapping, which entails rezoning parcels along the Blue Line light rail corridor to align with newly adopted TOD districts and policies. During the Advisory Committee’s most recent meeting on April 25, 2019, the Planning Department laid out additional details regarding the process, noting that more than 1900 parcels will be rezoned, excluding parcels inside the I-77/277 loop, Uptown Mixed-Use District (UMUD) zoning, and conditional or optional urban zoning districts. Given the magnitude of this rezoning endeavor, the Planning Department intends to invite the actual property owners who will be affected to four public information meetings in May and June. The Planning Department and Advisory Committee discussed the utility and logistical reality of expanding the audience for public discussion beyond property owners directly affected, leaving open the possibility for additional public input prior to the hearing on the zoning petition that ultimately is submitted. Interactive maps will be made available before these meetings that will show particular addresses and (re)zoning recommendations. The Planning Department anticipates submitting the rezoning petition in July 2019, with the City Council public hearing in September, Zoning Committee consideration in October, and a City Council decision also in October 2019.

Tree Ordinance Text Amendment and Sign Regulations

As the Advisory Committee continues to be invested in the implementation of the TOD revisions, it also has a hand in the development of revisions to the tree ordinance for urban sites and new sign regulations. The Advisory Committee was provided an update on the status of these projects at the April 25th meeting. The stakeholder group began work on a Tree Ordinance text amendment in March (get caught up here) and the Planning Department timeline anticipates a City Council decision in October 2019. New sign regulation development will kick off in June 2019, also with an anticipated October 2019 City Council decision. The Advisory Committee is scheduled to address the tree ordinance text amendment at its next two meetings in May and June, and the sign regulations during its June meetings.

CDOT Streets Map

Part of implementing the TOD revisions is creation of a Streets Map that supports TOD. The Charlotte DOT (CDOT) provided the Advisory Committee with an update on the Streets Map process, identifying several key characteristics of streets that support TOD. The goal is to plan streets that will support and facilitate: (1) Safety for all users; (2) Equitable mobility options/complete streets; (3) Highly livable neighborhoods; (4) Ongoing and rapid growth; (5) Economic development; (6) A useful, engaging and high-quality public realm; (7) Higher intensity, high walkability, and highly accessible development; and (8) Investment in transit (1st and last mile).

The Advisory Committee continues to dig in and we are excited about moving the needle as Charlotte transitions to a Unified Development Ordinance. Our next Advisory Committee meeting will be May 16, 2019, during which we will return to the format of gathering the entire committee together and meeting as one group. I will keep you posted.",[]

The process begins for Charlotte’s 2040 Plan for uptown. With our explosive growth, planning is vital. Guest host Erik Spanberg examines what’s next.

How should Uptown Charlotte grow? City and county officials are asking the public that question as they plot long term growth and development in a new vision plan for Center City. Charlotte is a city keen on plans and studies, and roughly every 10 years the city develops a new one for uptown.

A lot has changed in a decade as the city continues to experience explosive growth. We’ve seen the addition of the Charlotte Knights ballpark, Romare Bearden Park, and $1 billion worth of private development, including high-rise apartments and new businesses.

The area known as Center City has long outgrown the bounds of I-277 and now stretches into SouthEnd, out to JCSU in the Historic West End, the growing Camp North End, and neighborhoods in between.

As leaders kick off the planning process yet again, we look at what’s next for Charlotte’s downtown and discuss how to develop a unifying vision plan.

Newcomers to Charlotte often ask where all the old buildings are. Many were razed to make way for the future, but there is hope for historic preservation. Guest host Erik Spanberg sits down with experts to discuss why.

For a long time in Charlotte, old buildings have been demolished to make way for the new. That’s not particular to our city, but it seems to be a key part of Charlotte’s story.

It happens in neighborhoods and in Uptown where, in March, one of the last remaining buildings from the early 1900s was demolished to make way for new apartments. All hope is not lost, though, when it comes to preservation.

Work is being done by groups like the Charlotte Mecklenburg Historic Landmarks Commission to save our buildings before it is too late.

Get a daily rundown of the top stories on Urban Milwaukee

Alderman Russell W. Stamper, II has a bold vision. He wants Milwaukee to become the cleanest city in the country.

“I realize this won’t happen overnight, but if we work together we will be successful,” said Stamper at a Monday morning press conference announcing the city’s Big Clean MKE campaign.

After ticking off all of the city departments involved, ranging from the Department of Public Works to the Milwaukee Police Department, Stamper noted the city can’t get it done by itself. “We cannot do this without the other part of the team and that’s the entire community,” said the alderman.

A citywide awareness campaign is one prong of the effort. “There is no excuse for littering in our community,” said Stamper. To hammer home the message, an ordinance passed by the council in late February raised the littering fine from $50 to $500. The fine goes into effect Monday.

“Little by little, I think we have got away from being mindful of what our city looks like,” said Stamper’s colleague Alderwoman Chantia Lewis. “Don’t be a litterbug. Keep Milwaukee clean. We all need to do our part.”

Municipal Judge Derek Mosley said the municipal court will do what it can to support the effort. “We are hoping the $500 fine is a deterrent,” said Mosley. Those convicted of littering will have the option of community service. Mosley said the court could issue up to 50 hours of community service per offense with the Department of Public Works.

But today the municipal court doesn’t see many people in his court for littering offenses. The police department told Urban Milwaukee it only issued 51 citations for littering in 2018.

The rate of less than one ticketed offense per week is too high for Stamper. “I hope it goes down,” said the alderman. “If it goes up something is not working.” His vision relies on creating a city that cleans up after itself. But judging by the area around the site of the press conference, a vacant lot at N. 9th St. and W. North Ave., the city is currently missing out on ticketing countless offenders.

Join the Clean Up Effort

The city and non-profit partner Keep Greater Milwaukee Beautiful (KGMB) have a number of events planned for the community to get involved.

KGMB will host a community-wide cleanup kickoff on April 27th from 9 a.m. until 12 p.m. at Lincoln Park. The city is also planning to host the second annual citywide Big Clean MKE day on August 17th.

Can’t make any of the events? KGMB will distribute “whatever it takes” to clean up your neighborhood said the group’s executive director Joe Wilson. That includes everything from garbage bags and gloves to a “mobile tool shed” for groups of 30 or more. Those interested can register on KGMB.org.

From May 6th through June 24th, the city will also be offering expanded garbage pickup through Project Clean and Green. Bulk item pickup will be provided at no cost on predetermined dates. To learn more visit the city’s website.

https://urbanmilwaukee.com/2019/02/04/eyes-on-milwaukee-a-riverwalk-for-menomonee-valley/,['Milwaukee'],Eyes on Milwaukee: A Riverwalk for Menomonee Valley,"Get a daily rundown of the top stories on Urban Milwaukee

First introduced in 2017, a Common Council committee formally adopted design standards for a two-mile extension of the Milwaukee RiverWalk system Monday morning.

The extension will run along the Menomonee River from the river’s confluence with the Milwaukee River near N. 2nd St. and west to the 27th Street Viaduct and Three Bridges Park. That’s an approximately two-mile long corridor with the riverwalk planned for each side.

Like the Menomonee Valley’s redevelopment before it, the proposed valley riverwalk will have few peers nationally and even locally. The riverwalk won’t look much at all like what is seen Downtown; instead much of the planned riverwalk will consist of an asphalt trail, native grasses and strategically-sited tree groves.

Owing to the area’s predominantly industrial usage and history as a marsh, the riverwalk will function more as a trail along the river said Department of City Development planner Greg Patin.

“We wanted a document that reflected the uniqueness of the Menomonee Valley, but that was also clear and easy to use,” said Patin. The city, in partnership with non-profit Menomonee Valley Partners, issued an RFP in early 2018 to find a project consultant, ultimately hiring architecture firm HGA and engineering firm The Sigma Group.

The final document isn’t a blueprint for the city to start demolishing properties in the way, but instead a guide for where and how new segments should be developed. The city, as is standard practice with the rest of the system, will pay 70 percent of the associated cost of building a new segment as properties along the river are improved.

In 2017 the city passed a 50-foot overlay zone along each side of the river that governs the design of properties that are substantially redeveloped or newly constructed, encouraging more interaction with the river. The overlay zone sets aside 25 feet for the riverwalk corridor itself.

Design standards for the district mandate that the new trail segments must be at least 14-feet wide, compatible with Americans with Disabilities Act standards and open 24 hours a day. The asphalt paving would be 10 feet wide, with a two-foot-wide shoulder of crushed gravel running parallel to the paved trail on each side. Where space isn’t available on land, the riverwalk will have short segments over water.

Arboretum groves of at least 12 trees are envisioned every 300 to 600 feet, with concrete surfaces, lighting and benches. The change from concrete to asphalt is intended to warn cyclists of potential intersections and to better tolerate the root structure of the trees. Patin told the committee that connectivity into properties and the street grid is important to ensure the riverwalk is accessible.

The design standards also include landscaping designed to improve the environmental health of the river by reducing run-off through the use of permeable pavements, bioswales and native plantings.

Even with council approval, some segments of the corridor aren’t likely to see a riverwalk for generations, if ever. A gap will remain for the We Energies substation that is along the river across from the Valley Power Plant. In addition, there are a handful of parcels owned by Canadian Pacific Railway that aren’t likely to see riverwalk segments.

A small segment that complies with some of the standards already exists via the Hank Aaron State Trail extension that runs along the river near the city’s Department of Public Works facility and Marquette University‘s Valley Fields complex.

The Menomonee Valley design standards are far from the only riverwalk changes underway. As part of the Komatsu development in the Harbor District, a southern extension of the riverwalk is also being developed along the inner harbor and Kinnickinnic River. The previously planned Downtown and Historic Third Ward riverwalk is nearly complete with Trestle Park opening last summer.

The Menomonee Valley design standards will be up for adoption before the full Common Council on Tuesday, February 5th.

https://dailyreporter.com/2019/03/11/dems-select-milwaukee-for-2020-national-convention/,['Milwaukee'],Choice of Milwaukee for 2020 DNC to bring flurry of work (UPDATE),"Democrats picked Milwaukee on Monday for their 2020 national convention, setting up a situation in which the party’s standard-bearer will accept the presidential nomination in the heart of the old industrial belt that delivered Donald Trump to the White House.

Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez chose Milwaukee over Houston and Miami after deliberations lingered longer than party leaders or officials from the three finalist cities had expected. The Democratic party is expected to play up its connection to Milwaukee’s working class roots. It’s a sentiment that was evident in Perez’s comments following the announcement — and one that Wisconsin labor unions were eager to embrace. On Twitter following the announcement, The DNC pointed out that labor unions had built the “state-of-the-art” Fiserv Forum, where the convention will be held.

“We need to fight alongside our brothers and sisters in labor to build a brighter future together, and empower the diversity of our party and country,” Perez said in a statement. “This choice is a statement of our values, and I’m thrilled Milwaukee will host the 2020 Democratic National Convention,” he continued. “The Democratic Party is the party of working people, and Milwaukee is a city of working people.”

It will be the first time in more than a century that Democrats will be in a Midwest city other than Chicago to nominate their presidential candidate. The political spotlight will shine for a week on a metro area of about 1.6 million people. Once dubbed as “The Machine Shop of the World,” the famously working-class city also is known for its long love affair with beer and as the birthplace of Harley-Davidson motorcycles. The event runs from July 13 to July 16, 2020. Republicans are planning to gather in Charlotte, the largest city in North Carolina, from Aug. 24 to Aug. 27, 2020.

John Zapfel, political director for the Milwaukee-based International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 494, which contributed to the committee fund, said the convention could bring a lot of work for the union. Hotels, for instance, will undertake projects to prepare for the crowd of 50,000 that’s expected to follow the convention to the city.

In addition to placing the city in a national spotlight, Zapfel said he also hopes that the convention’s message will praise the importance of union labor.

“It’s in the Midwest and it has been neglected in the last election cycle,” Zapfel said. “When we’re spoken to, people listen.”

Milwaukee taxpayers won’t be on the hook for the convention’s expenses, under a deal passed during a special meeting Monday. Just hours after the convention announcement, the Milwaukee Common Council unanimously approved a contract between the city, the DNC and the host committee listing the city’s obligations in playing host for the event.

“It was a wise decision by the Mayor to pursue other financial opportunities to host the convention without putting the taxpayers at risk,” Ald. Michael Murphy said during the meeting.

The agreement also stipulates that the city will offer free rides during the event to convention-goers and the general public. The convention will place local officials under further pressure to find a way to extend Milwaukee’s streetcar to the Fiserv Forum.

City officials are still in the early stages of extending Milwaukee’s recently completed streetcar to the Fiserv Forum. A new line to the arena would run north from the streetcar’s headquarters at North 5th Street and West Clybourn Avenue along Vel R. Philips Avenue to the arena.

Preliminary engineering is still underway for an expansion to the arena and to the city’s Bronzeville neighborhood, a spokesman with the city’s Department of Public Works said Monday. The city has $20 million set aside that could be used to match other money to pay for a streetcar extension. In December, the city missed out on a federal grant that would have payed for half of the $40 million it would take to expand the line. DPW did not return a request for further comment by press time Monday.

Dan Bukiewicz, president of the Milwaukee Building and Construction Trades Council, said the convention will likely advance a number of building projects over the next year-and-a-half, especially in the city center. The streetcar’s extension to the Fiserv Forum may also follow the completion of a lakefront loop, which would take riders to the Milwaukee Art Museum and other waterfront attractions. The long-awaited Coture high-rise would include a first-floor transit concourse for streetcar.

“You’re going to have to (expand the streetcar),” Bukiewicz said. “You’re going to see remodels go on hotels that have been on hold. I wouldn’t be surprised to see if there’s a fast track on development downtown. Organized labor can get anything done.”

Bukiewicz also serves as mayor of Oak Creek, a southern suburb of Milwaukee that he expects to see a “huge windfall” from convention traffic.

Democrats are seeing plenty of significance in Milwaukee after the 2016 election was defined by Hillary Clinton’s being beaten in almost every part of what her campaign aides had confidently called a “Blue Wall” in the upper Midwest and Great Lakes region. That band of states twice sided with President Barack Obama, but Clinton held only Minnesota, ceding Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania — 64 of the necessary 270 electoral votes — as white working-class voters flocked to Trump. Afterward, Clinton took withering criticism for not once visiting Wisconsin as a general election candidate.

Since then, Wisconsin voters have re-elected the Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin and ousted former Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, in favor of the Democrats Tony Evers and the state’s first black lieutenant governor, Mandela Barnes.

Wisconsin Democrats noted those midterm election results as they lobbied Perez and DNC officials, and presidential candidates already are paying attention. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar came to Wisconsin in one of her first trips as a declared candidate.

“A lot people feel that we lost (in 2016) because this area had been ignored — whether it’s from a political standpoint or whether it’s from a governing standpoint,” said Barnes, one of the members of the convention bid committee. Holding the convention in Milwaukee, Barnes added, says “we are ready to reinvest in the Midwest, that the Midwest matters again.”

Democrats’ would be well-served by playing up their alliance with labor unions, Bukiewicz, which have a rich yet rocky history in Wisconsin. The state has seen a number of policies that have chipped away at unions under Walker, beginning with Act 10, which eliminated collective bargaining and led to an unsuccessful attempt to recall Walker.

“Without a doubt it’s going to become an issue,” Bukiewicz said. “Wisconsin was a battleground over labor rights just 8 or 10 years ago. (Unions) are still around. They are not going anywhere. They have always been here. That’s going to be a centralized issue.”",[]

""Milwaukee is America's most segregated city.""

It's a claim repeated over and over, but it is not entirely accurate.

Yes, the city of Milwaukee is very segregated and it is certainly among the most segregated.

But it's actually the Milwaukee metropolitan region — which includes Milwaukee County suburbs and surrounding counties — that typically tops the rankings of most segregated areas.

The city itself falls in the top 10.

But what do we mean when we say an area is the ""most segregated?"" How do experts measure segregation?

The segregation index

Segregation is typically measured using a black-white dissimilarity index. That represents the percentage of blacks that would need to relocate to be fully integrated with whites.

A value of 100 indicates complete segregation; a value of 0 equals complete integration.

The Milwaukee metropolitan area's segregation index is 79.8, according to the Brookings Institution.

The city of Milwaukee's segregation index is lower at 70.8, a Journal Sentinel analysis found.

How is integration defined

Full integration would mean every neighborhood had the same racial breakdown as the city or metro area as a whole, not a blanket 50-50 ratio.

For example, if a city is 60% white, 30% black and 10% Hispanic or Latino, then integration means each neighborhood would be composed of residents of whom 60% identify as white, 30% black and 10% Hispanic or Latino.

What does that mean in practical terms?

The Milwaukee metropolitan area's segregation index is 79.8, according to the Brookings Institution.

That means at least three in four black residents in the metro area would need to relocate in order to live in fully integrated neighborhoods with whites.

What are the rankings for the city and metro area?

Where does the city of Milwaukee fall compared to other large cities when it comes to segregation?

A Milwaukee Journal Sentinel analysis of census data found the following ranking for black-white segregation of the country's 50 largest cities:

Chicago New York City Miami Atlanta Philadelphia Boston Milwaukee Washington, D.C. Houston Cleveland

Meanwhile, the Milwaukee metro area routinely tops black-white segregation rankings from the Brookings Institution. The 2018 analysis from Brookings produced the following ranking:

Milwaukee New York City Chicago Detroit Cleveland Buffalo, New York St. Louis Cincinnati Philadelphia Los Angeles

Why is it important to account for a metro area, not just a city?

Segregation is not restricted to city borders.

Suburban developments frequently included racially restrictive housing covenants and aggressive zoning laws to prevent black homeowners or renters from moving to an area, often in direct response to school desegregation and open housing policies elsewhere.

For example, the first racial restriction in Wauwatosa was placed on the Washington Highlands Subdivision in 1919. The covenant stated:

""At no time shall the land included in Washington Highlands or any part thereof, or any building thereon be purchased, owned, leased or occupied by any person other than of white race. This prohibition is not intended to include domestic servants while employed by the owner or occupied by and (sic) land included in the tract.""

By the 1940s, at least 16 of the 18 Milwaukee County suburbs were using racially restrictive covenants to exclude black families from residential areas, according to records from the Metropolitan Integration Research Center, a nonprofit active in the late 1970s that examined segregation.

The search for a new official flag for the City of Milwaukee may be headed back to the drawing board.

Rather than taking steps to make the ""People's Flag of Milwaukee"" the official city flag, members of a Common Council committee on Thursday decided instead to huddle with MIlwaukee City Clerk Jim Owczarski to come up with a new game plan..

That means Owczarski may be tasked with the job of launching a new process to find a city flag, as recommended in a recent report from the Milwaukee Arts Board. But first he will discuss the flags plan with Alds. Nik Kovac, Khalif Rainey and Mark Borkowski as part of an information committee created by Council President Ashanti Hamilton.

""You can't move forward with something that's supposed to be a symbol of unity until you have unity, so hopefully we have a process that achieves unity,"" Kovac said after the meeting.

RELATED: Will the City of Milwaukee get a new flag? The Common Council sends the issue to the Milwaukee Arts Board

Borkowski pushed his fellow aldermen to set up a timeline for the search, in part to assure people progress was being made.

""I think a lot of work has been done by many, many people,"" Borkowski said. ""In fairness, let's have a decision by such-and-such a time.""

But Kovac stressed the importance of doing the search right.

""If we do it right, it's a multigenerational decision,"" he said.

Kovac added that he didn't ""want to delay for delay's sake.""

Thursday's meeting was the latest in the seemingly never-ending debate over the city flag.

A local graphic designer, Steve Kodis, began his mission to create a new flag for the city in 2015. He launched a website chronicling the movement and teamed up with Ken Hanson, the executive director of Greater Together, a nonprofit organization devoted to promoting racial and economic equality.

Hanson on Thursday defended the People's Flag process, which involved a citywide design contest, saying the search received extensive media coverage.

Some aldermen have backed making the People's Flag the official flag.

""I think this is an opportunity for us to be in sync with what the people want,"" Rainey said.

If that flag is eventually approved by the full council and Mayor Tom Barrett, the People's Flag would replace the current flag that has flown for more than six decades.

The People's Flag, a design known as ""Sunrise Over the Lake"" by Robert Lenz, won the 2016 contest and has since become ubiquitous around the city — appearing on bicycles, beer cans and bottles, Koss headphones, cars and Milwaukee Brewers baseball caps.

Supporters of the People's Flag gathered again at City Hall for Thursday's Steering and Rules Committee meeting, including a group of third-graders from Milwaukee College Prep.

Also on Thursday, city officials also debated changing how Milwaukee handles closing city offices due to weather.

The city currently requires employees to use vacation time or go unpaid when their offices close, under a policy that has been in place since 1989. Council members raised concerns about the policy after hearing from city workers unhappy about it.",[]
https://www.tmj4.com/news/local-news/city-of-milwaukee-considers-legal-actin-against-big-pharmaceutical-companies,['Milwaukee'],City of Milwaukee considers legal action against big pharmaceutical companies,"MILWAUKEE — MILWAUKEE -- The Milwaukee Common Council will actively search for legal counsel as they pursue legal action against pharmaceutical companies who manufacture opioids.

Wisconsin is one of 48 states who are going after Big Pharma for manufacturing opioids. During today's Common Council meeting, Ald. Michael Murphy says this weekend's 14 overdoses are proof the pharmaceutical companies need to be held responsible.

""One individual had a prescription filled in July with 131 pills,"" Murphy said. ""When found, they only had one pill left.""

Murphy authored a resolution to hire outside legal counsel to investigate possible solutions including litigation to the opioid epidemic. The legal counsel will work in collaboration with the state during class action lawsuits.

""This was a legal product sold by Big Pharma as a non-addictive drug in many cases,"" Murphy said. ""When we know most people got hooked on a legal narcotic through false representation, they have some liability. I think it's only fair the city recovers some of that cost we're spending so much money on right now.""

According to the National Institute of Drug Abuse, the use of prescription opioids has dramatically increased in the last 50 plus years. In the 1960s, 80 percent of opioid abuse started with heroin. Over time, the rate of first-time heroin use dropped to under 30 percent by the 2000s.

The first-time opioid abuse in prescriptions skyrocketed. In the 1960s, it was under 20 percent but jumped to roughly 75 percent in the 2000s.

""We feel strongly they bear a great deal of responsibility for getting citizens addicted to a legal narcotic by false representation of their drug and effects,"" Murphy said. ""I think there are some substantial dollars that could be recovered and hopefully there will e some sort of settlement.""

In May, Attorney General Josh Kaul sued Oxycontin-maker, Purdue Pharma, over marketing practices. He claims the company falsely advertised and misled the public about the dangers of the drug. The suit says 7,500 Wisconsin residents died from opioid overdoses between 2000 and 2017.

Murphy says legal counsel should be picked by September and he expects a decision or settlement by the end of the year.

""The cost to the taxpayers is in police time, paramedics time, time the county has to spend on this,"" Murphy said. ""Let alone the cost of Narcan and Naloxone which brings people to life.""

Murphy says any money won in a settlement would go toward expanding treatment options, prevention and education.

Your biggest problem in Providence might be narrowing down the sheer number of places where you want to eat.

That said, you won't go wrong beginning a day at Knead Doughnuts in the downtown business district. The spot is classic when it comes to design (it's in a former bank building) and styles (jelly doughnuts, fritters) but utterly modern when it comes to flavors and techniques. The brown butter-pecan and pistachio flavors are both musts, and there are lots of vegan and gluten-free options.

If you want to linger for your morning meal, check out The Duck & Bunny, a ""snuggery"" (the cafe's word for place that is adorable and cozy) in the trendy Fox Point neighborhood.

There's an emphasis on cupcakes and other sweet treats, but during the day, it's a great option for settling in with a laptop or a good book. (Sad side note: there are no ducks. Or bunnies.)

Beyond brunch

While Scorsese movies make it seem as if Italian-American communities have stuck to big cities such as Boston and New York City, there is a vibrant and well-established community in Providence.

To see the community in action, head to Federal Hill, where more than a dozen restaurants are lined up along the main drag of Atwells Avenue. The options can be a bit overwhelming, so keep an eye out for the upscale Enoteca Umberto's, classic red sauce at Angelo's and pizza at Caserta's.

For dinner, try to get a table at Persimmon, the James Beard Award-nominated New American spot on the aptly named Hope Street.

While the menu changes often based on seasons and availability, there's not a single bum note here. Persimmon has the best of New England's farms -- from sunchokes and onions to duck and Maine lamb -- but is still cozy enough that you can ask what a menu item is without feeling embarrassed.

Providence's best hotel is The Dean, and even if you're not staying there, you should make the trip simply to eat at North.

This too-cool-for-school spot doesn't have a phone number or take reservations, but if you can muscle your way in, the reward is Asian-inspired small plates such as sake-glazed bok choy, spicy ""dragon wings"" and oysters with nori mignonette.

Making a night of it? If you can find Courtland Club, which is inside an unassuming building on a residential street, you'll be happily rewarded. The speakeasy-style bar has some of the most inventive cocktails in the country, with ingredients such as beet juice and basil foam somehow feeling accessible and delicious.

If your travels bring you through Providence regularly, consider investing in an annual membership -- besides having the option to leave a beloved bottle of booze in a locker so you never have to haul it over yourself, there are periodic tasting nights and the one-off dinners with a guest chef.

One note: if it's warm out in Rhode Island, you are contractually obligated to try a Del's, which is a New England brand of frozen slushy lemonade. The green and white striped stands pop up throughout the state once it's hot out, and some will sell peach or watermelon-flavored lemonades, too.

To truly feel like a local, you also can't leave without a stop at one of the outposts of Newport Creamery, which is famous for its Awful Awful milkshake with sprinkles inside it.

Get your first taste of the art and design scene in Providence at the RISD Museum, which has a huge collection of work from around the world, from Rembrandt drawings and Chinese lacquerware to an Eames chair and couture dresses by designers such as Balenciaga and McQueen.

Beyond the art, which could keep you busy all day, the building is also home to an outpost of locally beloved Bolt Coffee (the other is in The Dean) and a store that sells products made by RISD graduates, such as striped backpacks and totes from indie brand Baggu.

However, don't let that be your only shopping stop. Along Westminster Street, there are several local boutiques, notably Craftland, which sells jewelry, home goods, stationery and more from local producers and designers, and light-filled Symposium Books, where you can stock up on new and vintage records and books.

Providence is home to two breathtaking libraries, the Fleet Library at RISD and the nearby Providence Athenaeum, which is public.

The Fleet is in a stunning former bank building and is not only notable for its architecture but for its collection of rare art and architecture books, while the Athenaeum pays homage to writers with Rhode Island roots such as HP Lovecraft and Edgar Allan Poe.

To keep the theme of architecture and history going, head to the Rhode Island State House. This Neoclassical building was designed by the New York City firm of McKim, Mead & White, who are also known for the Boston Public Library and the Washington Square Arch in New York City.

A plaque at the Athenaeum bears the names of famous horror fans, like Guillermo Del Toro, who chipped in to buy a plaque of Providence writer HP Lovecraft. Shutterstock

There are free public tours of the building every hour during the week, although you should make a reservation if you are traveling in a group.

Among the must-sees are a Royal Charter from when Rhode Island was one of the 13 British colonies and the iconic Gilbert Stuart portrait of President George Washington. (You may recognize it from the one-dollar bill.)

The State House and Capitol are across the street from Providence's central train station, making it super convenient as your first or last stop in town.

The great outdoors

Roger Williams Park is named for the state of Rhode Island's founder. Shutterstock

It's not just arts and culture that make Providence so utterly livable. There are also green spaces that help balance out the city-to-country proportions.

First up: the 472-acre Roger Williams Park, which is known as ""the people's park"" in Providence. Besides being, well, a park, the area is home to plenty of warm and cold weather options, including the Roger Williams Zoo, a botanic garden, a carousel, a planetarium and the Museum of Natural History.

WaterFire began in Providence in the 1990s. Shutterstock

During the warmer months, you can enjoy Providence's waterways in two different, but both worthy, fashions. First is by taking a cruise along the Providence River, which provides not only an alternate viewpoint of the city's best-known structures but also some necessary history and context, from Rhode Island's colonial days through the World Wars to the present.

Finally, you can't miss WaterFire.

This art show and public spectacle takes place along the city's waterfront, where dozens of small fires are tended by ""braziers,"" creating a thrilling effect that makes it look like -- you may have guessed -- the water is on fire.

The only drawback? You may have to fight locals for the best spot to view it -- even if they've been before, it feels new every time.

https://www.golocalprov.com/news/City-of-Providence-Admits-to-Overbilling-on-Tax-Bills,['Providence'],City of Providence Admits to Overbilling on Tax Bills,"City of Providence Admits to Overbilling on Tax Bills

The City of Providence sent out tax bills to tens of thousands of homeowners overcharging.

The administration of Jorge Elorza now admits an accounting error on the first-quarter tax bills sent out to homeowners, following a contentious budget battle that ultimately resulted in a homestead exemption of 40% for the current fiscal year.

Now, after a number of taxpayers raised the issue with the city that their homestead exemption came out to just less than 40% — meaning that their tax bill in those instances came out to be a dollar or more higher — the city acknowledged that it would be “making the proper adjustments” in the next set of tax bills.

The city has approximately 30,000 owner-occupied homes. The total overbilling is estimated to be between $50,000 and $100,000.

“The City is aware of the issue with the recent property tax bills and is making the proper adjustments. The impact is minimal to individual taxpayers,” said Victor Morente in a statement to GoLocalProv.com.

“Refunds will not be issued but the remaining balances for accounts impacted will be credited and adjusted,” added Morente. “The City is advising all who may need assistance with this matter to reach out directly to the Assessor’s Office at 401-680-5229 or by emailing [email protected]""

In June, at an unprecedented 8 a.m. press conference, the Providence City Council leadership had unveiled a new tax plan with just two-plus weeks in the fiscal year to drastically change the burden to the homeowners of the most expensive homes in the city.

After a contentious back-and-forth between Elorza’s office — which said the new budget was illegal — and City Council leadership, which said the changes were necessary to alleviate the drastic increase in home values in certain sections of the city in the latest revaluation which resulted in higher tax bills for lower-income residents, the council ultimately slashed millions off of Elorza’s budget and instituted a 40% homestead exemption across the board.

Accounting Issue Addressed

Providence resident Ginny Pires said that when she got her tax bill for her home valued at $379,200, she did the math when the homestead exemption was listed at $151,617 — or 39.983386%.

Pires said that recalculated for 40%, the homestead exemption should have been $151,680.

As a result — Pires, who has an elderly exemption of $511.14 — saw that what the city billed her $5,589.44 in taxes should have been $5,587.89.

“The difference between what the city was allowing as an exemption was only $63 less than what a 40% exemption would be; less exemption, more tax. It wasn’t the dollar difference that bothered me, but the principle that the bill stated the exemption was 40%. That’s what motivated me to go to the Providence Tax Assessor’s office to have my bill corrected, or at least get an explanation as to why there was a discrepancy,” wrote Pires.

“I told the employee of the discrepancy, and was given a 40% exemption with the difference applied to my tax due as a credit in the 1st quarter. The employee was very courteous and responsive to my concern. I then told my neighbor about this experience. He later told me that he also did not receive the stated 40% homestead exemption. Perhaps there are others...who should check the math on your owner-occupied residential tax bill before you make the 1st quarterly payment,” said Pires.

“The employee told me that the reason for the discrepancy was a “computer glitch” so that the quarterly payment would come out even. I doubted that to be true, but didn’t challenge her on it,” said Pires. The difference on my bill was $1.55. You only need a nickel difference or less to be able to divide by 4, and either come out even, or pay a penny more in 1 or more quarterly payments.”

Providence Mayor Jorge Elorza had pledged during his campaign in October 2014 to “redevelop Camp Cronin for use throughout the year for youth, adult, and senior activities.”

On Monday, Providence City Councilman Michael Correia was at the City of Providence-owned property at Camp Cronin in Narragansett and decried the condition of the buildings that the city once used — and considered selling — but now sit in disrepair.

“Shocking to see the conditions of Camp Cronin [owned] by City of Providence,” said Correia. “I remember traveling to Narragansett with our seniors and city youth for cookouts, bingo, basketball and just a day away from the city.”

SLIDES: SEE PHOTOS BELOW

City Councilman John Igliozzi said he thinks it has been several decades since Camp Cronin has been used by the city.

""Back then, the City of Providence Recreation Department didn't have all the rec centers we have now. The programming was different. Back then, it was get the kids to the beach -- now, it's providing services in the city,"" said Igliozzi.

According to the Town of Narragansett, the City of Providence-owned Camp Cronin property is assessed at over $760,000.

""When we do bonding it's part of an asset -- possession of it helps us get bonding and loans,"" said Igliozzi, the Council Finance Chair. ""It's probably in our bonding as collateral""

In 2017, federal and state officials lauded the completion of a $8.4 million restoration project at the adjacent state-owned Camp Cronin Fishing Area.

As the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management stated in its release:

In 2012, Hurricane Sandy caused extensive damage to the area surrounding Camp Cronin and washed out a portion of the access road that runs from Ocean Road to the jetty. The breakwater repair project was performed by the US Army Corps of Engineers in partnership with DEM, and included construction of a 70-foot wide, 480-foot long hybrid stone revetment to stabilize the shoreline and restore safe public access to the fishing area. The project also included repairs to the adjacent East Shore Arm Breakwater of the Point Judith Harbor of Refuge.

https://www.ecori.org/public-safety/2019/4/1/providence-announces-5g-plans-amid-health-risks,['Providence'],Providence Announces 5G Plans Amid Potential Health Risks — ecoRI News,"PROVIDENCE — Despite a lack of oversight and concerns about possible health risks, the city is moving forward with a 5G wireless communication network.

On March 25, city officials announced the first phase of the rollout of a 5th Generation (5G), small-cell microwave communication network. The system promises to provide faster Internet service and offer expanded capacity for networks that assist driverless vehicles, wireless electricity meters, and other so-called “smart devices.”

Similar 5G network proposals are facing community opposition around the country over possible health effects. Opponents point to the close-range antennas and equipment boxes that increase human exposure to mid-range radio waves than existing cell networks.

To operate effectively, 5G systems need to be spaced about 200 feet apart. They are often affixed to utility poles and streetlights close to homes and schools.

The health effects of 5G are largely untested and unknown. There have been limited studies that show harm to mice and rats from exposure to older 2G and 3G radio waves. Some communities want to halt installations until 5G is proven safe or exposure standards are set.

In Danville, Calif., the Town Council blocked Verizon from receiving a 5G wireless permit after residents complained about health issues. Communities in Colorado, Maryland, Oregon, Texas, and Wyoming and in Europe are asking for moratoriums on 5G deployment.

Massachusetts has several bills looking at the health risks associated with 5G wireless technology and other wireless equipment.

In February, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., criticized the Federal Communications Commission and the Food and Drug Administration for not studying the health effects of 5G technology.

“So there really is no research ongoing,” Blumenthal said during a committee hearing. “We’re kind of flying blind here, as far as health and safety is concerned.”

Meanwhile, 5G equipment is showing up along Rhode Island roads. But getting information on how they got there and plans about the technology’s deployment in Rhode Island has been difficult. Verizon, the Rhode Island Department of Transportation, the governor’s office, the city of Providence, and the University of Rhode Island have stonewalled questions on the issue. Gov. Gina Raimondo was a booster of a 5G rollout and promoted legislation that preempts cities and towns from regulating the installation of such systems.

In response to questions about health risks, the city said it’s asking potential bidders to consider the health and wellness of Providence residents.

Discussion about the buildup of wireless devices is expected to take place during an April 9 workshop hosted by the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission and its Power Sector Transformation Group.",[]
https://www.buildingsaltlake.com/salt-lake-city-single-room-occupancy-ordinance/,['Salt Lake City'],Salt Lake City looks to boost its stock of micro-apartments,"Salt Lake City planners are proposing a new ordinance they hope will lead to the creation of new micro-apartments with shared amenities that could help provide needed housing to people who can’t afford longer-term rentals.



Single-room occupancy (SRO) apartments have been part of the homelessness conversation in Utah for years. The city lost about 50 SRO units when it bought and demolished the Regis and Cambridge hotels near 250 S. State St.

Advocates believe paving the way for more of the small units by allowing them in certain zones across the city could quickly add to the stock of low- and very-low income apartment units.



The city is looking to clarify the ordinance around single-room occupancy units (SROs), and expand the list of zone types where apartments could be developed and rented on a weekly or monthly basis. That change is targeted to generate housing for people who can’t afford a month’s rent.



The Salt Lake City Council is preparing to vote on the proposed ordinance at its May 7 meeting with public comment scheduled for April 23. Among the requirements developers and building owners would have to follow:



Apartments would need to be a minimum of 100 square feet for a single person or 120 square feet for two.

Units could have either a private bathroom or kitchen, but not both. They could also have neither amenity.

SROs could house 1-2 tenants each on either a weekly or a monthly basis.

Developments would require fewer parking spaces per unit than other similar developments.

The ordinance would require developments to have a manager present on site around the clock, and shared amenities would have to be monitored with security cameras.



“If we have to put in our ordinance how you should manage this property, that’s a lot for us to regulate,” new councilwoman Ana Valdemoros, who represents downtown.

The Rio Grande Hotel on downtown’s west side is the only existing SRO development in the city today, though the former Capitol Motel (now Capitol Homes) near 1700 South State St. has been managed in a similar fashion since last year.

In picking the zones shown in color on the map, the city said it was trying to drive SRO development toward areas that were more bike and pedestrian friendly and near transit. The dwellings would need half a parking space per unit, compared with two parking spaces Salt Lake City requires for multi-family developments with two bedrooms or more.



SROs would largely be permitted west of 700 East, and even primarily west of State Street. District 6, which includes the East Bench and Yalecrest, would be devoid of any areas where SROs would be permitted under the proposed ordinance.



The city is looking to allow them largely where commercial, downtown and high-density uses already exist. It would not allow them in community business zones like 9th and 9th.



The placement serves as a reminder of when the City Council considered blocking accessory dwelling units from being built on the East Bench and in the Avenues before backing out and allowing them citywide. SROs would be almost entirely blocked from those affluent neighborhoods under the proposed ordinance.



Here are the changes neighborhoods could see under the proposed ordinance.



District 1 (Rose Park, Fairpark)

SROs would be clustered primarily around North Temple from 900 West to 2200 West.

District 2 (Glendale, Poplar Grove)

SROs would be allowed on north/south corridors along I-15, Redwood Road and 5600 West, as well as along 2100 South.

District 3 (Avenues, Capitol Hill and Marmalade)

Sections of the Marmalade neighborhood west of 300 West would allow SROs, while all of Capitol Hill and all but one parcel of land in the Avenues wouldn’t offer the permission.

District 4 (Downtown SLC)

Much of the city’s urban core would allow the development of SROs.

District 5 (Liberty Wells, Central 9th, Ballpark, 9th and 9th)

SROs would be available largely west of State Street. The 9th and 9th neighborhood, which is largely zoned Commercial Business, wouldn’t allow SROs. Several notorious motels along State and Main streets could be converted to SROs, as has already happened on a temporary basis at the Capitol Motel.

District 6 (East Bench, Yalecrest)

SROs wouldn’t be permitted in this East Bench district.

District 7 (Sugar House)

Sugar House would allow SROs primarily running east/west along 2100 South, as well as on either side of Highland Drive between 2100 South and I-80.

https://www.smartcitiesdive.com/news/fcc-designates-nyc-salt-lake-city-as-innovation-zones/563345/,['Salt Lake City'],"FCC designates NYC, Salt Lake City as 'innovation zones'","Dive Brief:

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced its first two ""innovation zones"" to test advanced wireless communications technology.

The designation coincides with two Platforms for Advanced Research (PAWR) testbeds in these locations, previously announced by the National Science Foundation (NSF) to test wireless and broadband technology in a real world setting. The innovation zone will allow participants to conduct non-related experiments under a single authorization within the testbed sites, providing they comply with FCC guidelines.

The projects will explore ""new advanced technologies and prototype networks like those that can support 5G technologies,"" FCC Chairman Ajit Pai said in a statement.

Dive Insight:

The two PAWR sites are meant to push the boundaries of wireless technology and find new applications that couldn’t be tested in the laboratory.

The New York site, known as COSMOS (Cloud Enhanced Open Software Defined Mobile Wireless Testbed for City-Scale Deployment), is focused on wireless and cloud-based communications in a dense urban area in West Harlem. The Salt Lake City project, POWDER (A Platform for Open Wireless Data-driven Experimental Research with Massive MIMO Capabilities), is exploring ""dynamic spectrum sharing and advanced wireless antenna technologies,"" according to NSF.

A third PAWR site in North Carolina's Research Triangle focused on unmanned aerial systems was announced this week, and NSF has put out a call for proposals for a fourth site that will explore rural broadband.

The PAWR zones have already been able to conduct experiments within select spectrum bands, but the ""innovation zone"" designation opens up a wider geographic area and more frequencies under a single license award. The move ""adds flexibility to go beyond some of the experimentation that goes on in a laboratory,"" Joe Kochan, principal investigator and project director for the PAWR Project Office, told Smart Cities Dive.

Advanced wireless networks and 5G will be able to support an array of smart city innovations, from smart grid technology to internet of things (IoT) sensors to connected vehicles. These test sites will ensure that those applications can be properly tested to make sure they are sustainable, safe and will be able to function on wireless networks without causing significant disruption.",[]
https://www.deseret.com/indepth/2019/8/23/20830148/united-nations-salt-lake-city-united-national-civil-society-conference-inclusion-youth,['Salt Lake City'],United Nations looks to Salt Lake City for a ‘global conversation on inclusion and sustainability’,"SALT LAKE CITY — Almost half of the 6,000 attendees to a United Nations conference here next week will be young adults from 138 countries. But the large contingent of youth and the meeting’s location in the Mountain West will carry the same gravitas of previous gatherings at U.N. headquarters in Manhattan.

Indeed, the selection of Utah’s capital and heavy involvement of youth in planning and participating in the 68th Annual United Nations Civil Society Conference makes a statement.

“In visiting Salt Lake City I was struck by the rapid growth and innovation there, symbolized by the construction cranes dotting the beautiful mountain landscape, and by the sense of opportunity as young people flock to the region for its educational and job offerings. It is a great setting for a global conversation on inclusion and sustainability in cities and communities of all sizes,” Alison Smale, United Nations under-secretary general for global communications, said in the statement.

The three-day conference marks the first time it has been held outside of New York when the United States has been host. Paris, Mexico City and Melbourne, Australia, are among cities that have hosted the conference in the past.

This year’s event will focus on sustainable cities and communities. The topic is among the 17 sustainable development goals the U.N. General Assembly adopted in 2015. Others include ending hunger and poverty, reducing inequality, and promoting decent work and economic growth — all to be achieved by 2030.

“The Sustainable Development Goals are a global framework for cooperation to tackle the great challenges of our day,” said Maruxa Cardama, conference chairwoman and secretary general of the non-governmental organization Partnership on Sustainable Low Carbon Transport. “Cities are growing so quickly that it is imperative we build them thoughtfully and make extra efforts to ensure that no person or group is left behind.”

More than half (55%) of the world’s population lives in urban areas and that figure is expected to reach 68% by 2050, according to the U.N. The conference is intended to help government and nongovernment leaders find sustainable solutions to poverty, housing, hunger and health, clean water, energy, climate change, infrastructure, transportation, education, migration, violence and gender equality.

More than 90 percent of Utah’s population lives along the densely populated Wasatch Front corridor, with Salt Lake City located near the midpoint of the more than 100-mile stretch of cities and towns connected by roads and transit systems.

Conference organizers were persuaded by Salt Lake City officials that the city’s efforts to tackle many of the issues the conference will address make it an ideal location.

“With everything we are doing to build a sustainable and resilient city, from investing in more equitable transit and housing to becoming a clean energy city — Salt Lake City is the perfect place to have these important conversations,” Mayor Jackie Biskupski said.

It will be one of the largest international events the city has hosted since the 2002 Winter Olympics.

“It’s fitting that the U.N. is holding this here in that Utah is recognized globally as a place with a robust free market economy and civil society,” said Deseret News Opinion Editor Boyd Matheson. He will moderate a panel discussion on how faith groups and other nongovernmental entities can offer people upward mobility, or opportunities to improve their economic situation.

Youth movement

The annual conference used to be heavily focused on the work of non-governmental organizations — nonprofit agencies engaged in humanitarian, educational, health, human rights and environmental endeavors.

But a U.N. reorganization and renaming of departments and sections resulted in changing the name to Civil Society Conference, which better describes the broader group of stakeholders involved, including young adults, said Annie Deng, co-chairwoman for the Outcomes Sub-committee and sub-task lead on the Youth Declaration for the conference.

Biskupski said the city made an intentional effort to recruit youth in the planning and carrying out of the conference. In fact, a record 43 percent of the attendees will be 32 years old or younger, she said.

“We want this younger group to be at the table and having their voices heard because they are living with these issues today.”

“We like 32 years because that is the average age” of the world population, she said. “We want this younger group to be at the table and having their voices heard because they are living with these issues today.”

Vlada Yeramenko, 23, is among the dozens of local college students who got involved in organizing events for the conference. A native of Ukraine who graduated in May from the University of Utah with a bachelor’s degree in international relations, she said her academic interests and her personal experience as an immigrant inspired her to get involved.

Her mother’s marriage brought Yeramenko to the United States when she was 15. She spoke little English, but a welcoming community in Sante Fe, New Mexico, helped her assimilate, develop her skills as a violinist and eventually find her passion in international relations.

“This is a conference for everyone to feel included, and then to work to find solutions to the problems that we’re facing right now,” she said.

The young adults are also injecting an element of fun with their work. Before attendees begin three days of speeches and absorbing information from about 200 workshops, youth planners put together events on Saturday where they will be planting trees, cleaning up a section of the Jordan River, relaxing to yoga and discussing the U.N.’s sustainable development goals.

The conference will include youth-led workshops and unveil a Youth Climate Compact that was drafted with input submitted before the conference from young adults around the world, said Deng.

The lengthy document lists nearly two dozen action items — ranging from recycling and consumption awareness to divesting in fossil fuels businesses and converting to renewable energy sources — that youth pledge to do to “unite in action against the climate crisis.”

Sustainable cities

Biskupski said the city’s negotiated agreement with Rocky Mountain Power in 2016 to provide 100% renewable energy by 2032 was a factor that caught the attention of U.N. officials reaching out to Salt Lake.

“That made news across the country because cities had not been able to get their energy providers to really move the needle on going to 100% renewable,” she said.

The city’s investment in affordable housing, transit development and infrastructure were other components to its proposal that won over the U.N. a year ago this month.

Another factor is the state’s involvement in humanitarian work, said Baldomero Lago, chief international officer for Utah Valley University, who first suggested to U.N. officials that they reach out to Salt Lake, the Deseret News reported in March. He had access to U.N. officials through after his Utah Valley United Nations, a group of humanitarian relief groups, business and faith-based groups, gained U.N. accreditation.

“We talk about sustainability, but it is the humanity that actually makes things happen to sustain the world that we live in,” Lago said in November, when the city announced it was hosting the conference.

Also at that announcement was Ahmad Corbitt, a director in the public affairs Department of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who added that cities are sustained first and foremost by residents’ willingness to give of themselves.

The church is offering that opportunity at the conference. Its U.N.-affiliated Latter-day Saint Charities is partnering with Feeding Children Everywhere, American Airlines, JustServe and conference participants to assemble 375,000 meals for needy children during the three-day event.

Latter-day Saint Charities Director Sister Sharon Eubank will also sit on a conference panel in a Tuesday session titled Civil Society Monitoring.

https://sgbonline.com/evo-to-create-community-hub-in-salt-lake-city/,['Salt Lake City'],Why is Evo Creating A Community Hub In Salt Lake?,"Evo believes it has thrived because it’s always been focused on creating places to support communities. Now, the Seattle-based retailer of ski and snowboard gear and apparel plans to double-down on those efforts with the development of Campus SLC, a 100,000 square foot retail complex to open in Salt Lake City.

Campus SLC will be located in the city’s Granary neighborhood, a few blocks south of downtown. The building will include an Evo retail store, local retailer L9 Sports, a hotel, restaurants, an art gallery, creative workspace, skatepark, and additional recreation to be announced soon. The project has a targeted opening date of fall 2020.

The Evo retail store and All Together Skatepark will feature indoor/outdoor integration and will offer the same programs as other Evo locations, including demos, sales and service for ski, snowboard, skate, wake and mountain bikes, an art gallery, and a music and movie venue.

Other details on the project include:

Evo’s partner on the project is Lake Union Partners, a Seattle-based private development firm that specializes in historic renovation.

The buildings, the oldest of which was built in 1926, will be designed by Lloyd Architects, a local Salt Lake firm known for spaces including Campos and Publik.

Evo will sponsor the Salt Lake City SheJumps chapter’s Wild Skills program, which provides culturally competent adventures and curriculum to traditionally underserved youth in the outdoors.

Evo’s content partner will be local adventure photographer Adam Clark.

The campus news comes on the heels of Evo’s move into Canada with the acquisition of five stores in Whistler and Evo’s headquarters move in the Fremont neighborhood of Seattle. Having started as a website in 2001, Evo also has flagship stores in Seattle, Portland and Denver.

The project is the vision of Bryce Phillips, Evo’s founder and CEO, who has long championed community projects that embrace fashion, culture and sport.

The only other All Together Skatepark is beneath Evo’s Seattle location and it regularly hosts lessons and skate camps. The Seattle complex also sports two restaurants to support Evo’s aim of creating gathering places. Similar community and experiential elements have been brought to other stores, including a monthly art gallery and events.

Another venture to strengthen ties with local communities is Evo’s La Familia program, whereby Evo partners with independent retailers in key markets to ship orders to their stores. La Familia retailers don’t profit from the initial sale, but it drives traffic to their stores, often leads to ancillary sales and puts Evo’s customers in touch with quality mechanics and technicians.

Here, Phillips, a former professional skier, discusses his vision for the Campus SLC project, why Salt Lake City was chosen, and what the investment means for Evo.

What inspired this project and what’s the goal? From its founding, Evo has always strived to build community through a love of the outdoors, music, arts and culture. Campus SLC is directly born from that founding DNA. Our goal is to create a crossroads and hub for the Salt Lake City community. We have been inspired by many projects, but we are not aware of others putting together the pieces exactly like this. Our hope and plan is to set a global bar.

Why Salt Lake City? Salt Lake City offers an amazing juxtaposition of urban environment paired with outdoor recreation access. It was a natural next step for Evo, especially having experienced the amazing response to our Denver store, which we opened in 2016. We continued to be impressed by the enthusiasm among Salt Lake City residents, and we are excited to be able to share in that stoke. It’s also great to have an opportunity to breathe new life into such a beautiful building and growing neighborhood.

There is also a strong community of passionate recreationalists, and we can’t wait to create a “community center” for those looking to connect around our shared love of outdoor and urban culture.

How does it all work? For example, who’s funding and who’s running the different parts of the project? We are: both Evo, the retail business, and as a joint venture partner in the real estate development project. We are working with a small group of aligned investors that share our vision and are inspired to have a positive impact on the community. Seeing the project through from vision to operation affords us the opportunity to be intentional with every detail.

What are you most interested in seeing how the project all comes to life? The collective group has a history of doing projects like these, whether smaller versions or each of the standalone pieces. Here, we are bringing it all together, knowing that the collection will be an up-leveled customer experience. From a business perspective, we really look forward to measuring the incremental upside that the operating businesses realize as well as incrementality on the real estate. We know that we are heading toward a scenario where we outperform the sum of the parts but proving that out and measuring it so that we can apply moving forward is where it really gets fascinating.

With regards to “what is our hope,” we’ll know that it’s successful when we can see and feel that we are having a positive impact on the community. This project is meant to embrace all that come into contact. From a local art enthusiast to a kid learning to skateboard to a hard-core skier from California that flies in and stays with us at the hotel, we want this to be a positive, engaging place for all.

Is this a transformative move for Evo? It’s definitely a significant step for Evo, but it’s also not a far reach from where we’ve been. When you look at our family of past projects and where we come from, this just makes sense. Moreover, as mentioned above, it’s really doubling down on our core, our DNA, our passion for delivering experiences where people connect and celebrate their love for outdoor culture.

Full Press Release:

SEATTLE, WA (June. 11, 2019)

Seattle-based outdoor and action sports retailer evo, in partnership with Lake Union Partners, has announced its most ambitious project to date, Campus SLC, a collection of complementary businesses designed to drive community around a shared passion for outdoor culture.

Campus SLC will be located in the Granary neighborhood of Salt Lake City, Utah, an up-and-coming district a few blocks south of downtown. The 100,000 square foot brick, timber and concrete block building will include an evo retail store, local retailer L9 Sports, hotel, restaurants, an art gallery, creative work space, All Together Skatepark, and additional recreation to be announced soon. The project has a targeted opening date of fall 2020, though plans are still being finalized.

“Our vision is to create a place for the community, bringing ethos-driven businesses together along with customers that share our passion for the outdoors and all of the cultural elements that surround the lifestyle,” said Bryce Phillips, Founder and CEO of evo. “It’s the sum of its parts that’s so exciting—a seamless experience, celebrating the intersection of our shared love of the outdoors and urban environment.”

The buildings, the oldest of which was built in 1926, will be designed by Lloyd Architects, a local Salt Lake firm known for their beautiful spaces including Campos and Publik. “We’re dedicated to customer experience, which makes them the perfect partner. They understand how design can help blend sport, culture, art, and service,” said Tommy Trause, Director of Hospitality and Ecosystem, who’s heading up the project. “We believe in retaining the integrity of these historic buildings, which have such soul and history. They just don’t make them like that anymore.”

The new evo retail store and All Together Skatepark will feature indoor/outdoor integration and will offer the same programs as other evo locations—a robust demo and service offering, ski, snowboard, skate, wake and mountain bike retail, an art gallery, and a music and movie venue.

The move into Salt Lake City is lead by evo’s signature focus on investment in the local community. Existing tenant L9 Sports has been in close collaboration with evo on this project and will remain an integral member of the campus, complementing evo’s flagship location next door. evo is also thrilled to sponsor the Salt Lake City SheJumps chapter’s Wild Skills program, which provides culturally competent adventures and curriculum to traditionally underserved youth in the outdoors. In addition, evo’s content partner is local adventure photographer Adam Clark.

The campus news comes on the heels of evo’s move into Canada with the acquisition of five retail stores in Whistler and evo’s headquarters move in the Fremont neighborhood of Seattle.

“We’ve been able to grow and thrive as a result of our focus on community in a way that’s authentic to our customers,” Phillips said. “We’re thrilled and humbled to be a part of this project in Salt Lake City and can’t wait to see it come to life.”",[]
https://www.nashvillepost.com/business/development/article/21082607/giarratana-offers-plan-to-reinvent-downtown-street,['Nashville'],Giarratana offers plan to reinvent downtown street,"Veteran high-rise developer envisions new-look Anne Dallas Dudley Boulevard

Tony Giarratana has learned a thing or two about urban placemaking during his 30-plus-year career reinventing properties with tall buildings. Now the veteran Nashville-based developer envisions a project of a different type — in essence, an “outdoor room” that would strike an eye-catching pose within the epicenter of the city’s central business district.

Specifically, Giarratana is proposing a radical overhaul of Anne Dallas Dudley Boulevard and its sidewalks (see here and here courtesy of Google Street View), which connect Union and Church streets. If undertaken, Anne Dallas Dudley Park would offer a two-lane street for slow-moving vehicles and lots of green space for pedestrians via a concept known as a woonerf, which was originally implemented in The Netherlands.

Giarratana told the Post he plans to submit the complete street proposal to Metro, regardless of whether the city issues a request for proposals related to Church Street Park, the tiny public green space upon which the developer and his company wanted to build the high-end residential skyscraper Paramount (read here).

To carry a price tag that is not being disclosed, Anne Dallas Dudley Park would be Giarratana’s latest in a string of visionary projects for Church Street, including (listed chronologically): The Cumberland, the Bennie Dillon Lofts, Viridian and 505.

“We have had many meetings and collective input of Church Street,” Giarratana said regarding a process that began in the mid-1990s. “Each successive project has been informed by the residents, office workers and business owners at that time.”

In 2018, Giarratana LLC proposed a land swap with Metro involving the pocket park, which sits across Church Street from the main library. The tiny green space was the first pocket park created since Nashville's urban renaissance, which began in the late 1990s. As part of the deal, the development company would have transferred to Metro a parking lot located at 301 James Robertson Parkway so that the city could create a replacement pocket park.

Relatedly, Giarratana LLC (which also includes key team members Jenny McClain, Phil Meadows and Ted Kromer) would have committed $2 million toward the conversion of the James Robertson lot into a replacement park and waived a development fee to assist Metro in developing city-owned land (at 505 Second Ave. N.) with a services center and apartment building for the homeless. The project would have cost about $25 million and featured 100 residential units.

After pushback from those opposed to the plan, Mayor David Briley earlier this year said Metro planned to eventually seek request for proposals related to the park. The RFP effort is on hold due to the run-off election this September and its status is unclear.

Giarratana told the Post this week he decided to go ahead and have various parties work on a vision for the street. Participants have been Nashville-based Barge Design Solutions (for design); Agora Partners, which has offices in Los Angeles and New York and devised the park’s activation plan; and Fletcher Ridge, a Nashville-based company that created a video (see here).

“People can watch it privately and we can play in presentations,” Giarratana said.

Giarratana said he is flexible as to the various scenarios that could unfold, including via the possible RFP. For example, Metro could undertake the complete street project itself (Giarratana said he is open to offering the city the plans at cost). Or the effort could be a public-private partnership, with Giarratana LLC — were it to be awarded the RFP — overseeing, paying the full cost and completing in one year. Under that scenario, and via the RFP, the company would be likely to then have the pocket park site for the Paramount skyscraper.



If Anne Dallas Dudley Park materializes as Giarratana envisions, it would offer one acre of green space. In contrast, Church Street Park covers 0.27 acres, according to Metro records. As planned, the future Anne Dallas Dudley Park could be closed for events. The street itself would function much like the segment of Fifth Avenue South between Korean Veterans Boulevard and Demonbreun Street, which has no curbs and sees pedestrians and motorists interacting in a relatively safe and distinctive manner.

The park could offer, among others, movies, live music, free wi-fi, so-called technology smart benches, puppet shows, yoga and food carts (see a video here).

Ben Donksy, an Agora principal, said a key goal is having each of the street’s four corners at Church and Union activated.

“Tony is a real estate developer but he has a similar attitude that I’m used to seeing in [citizen] advocacy and downtown [partnership] groups,” Donsky said. “My focus is figuring out how to make the park an accommodating place.""



Mary Vavra, a planner and landscape architect with Barge Design Solutions, said the shared street concept is new to Nashville but “common” in cities that tend to be very progressive.

“We are excited to introduce the idea to Nashville and create an interesting twist with the use of lush planting and lawn areas for activities such as yoga and movie nights,” Vavra said. “I hope Nashvillians will support this opportunity to breathe new life into a tired streetscape.”

Vavra said the design process was influenced by many of the symbols used in the suffrage movement (of which Anne Dallas Dudley was a key figure) and previous studies by the Nashville Civic Design Center.

The Barge team includes surveyors, engineers and landscape architects, including John Brown, with whom Vavra has collaborated on several projects for more than 20 years (including the one involving the First Art Museum in 2000).

“During our team research for Anne Dallas Dudley, we discovered that John’s distant cousin, Elizabeth Avery Meriwether of Memphis, was one of the first women in Tennessee to push for women’s suffrage, and she worked with Anne Dallas Dudley on the movement,” Vavra said.

Donsky said that during the initial phase of the effort, he was a “little skeptical” the plan could be fully effective.

“And then I saw what Mary had done,” he said. “It is very forward-thinking public space design. She has used a very traditional and comfortable design vocabulary.”

Giarratana said the team has been working on Anne Dallas Dudley Park the past several months. He added that downtown residents, business owners and office workers have provided input the last 12 months or so related to the street and the pocket park.

“They want a special urban neighborhood space,” he said. “This project could provide that.”

https://www.nashvillepost.com/business/development/article/21087628/reports-ranks-nashville-ranks-in-nations-top-five,['Nashville'],Reports ranks Nashville ranks in nation’s top five,"ULI, PwC study shows city remains hot in real estate sector

Nashville’s real estate sector has enjoyed a major hot streak since the Great Recession.

And a national publication continues to recognize the heat.

The Urban Land Institute (ULI) and PwC released Thursday their Emerging Trends in Real Estate 2020, with the annual overview ranking Nashville No. 3 nationally, up from No. 5 last year.

For comparison, Austin ranks No. 1 and Raleigh-Durham at No. 2. Charlotte and Boston fill out the top five at Nos. 4 and 5, respectively.

The report (read here), which lists 80 cities, assesses how factors such as the environment, infrastructure, demographics, consumer behavior and technology are necessitating flexibility in cities’ space design, development and business operations.

Mark Deutschmann, president of locally based Core Development and ULI Nashville chair (2017-2019), emailed the Post the following:

“It’s really incredible we’re No. 3 this year and have made the Top 10 market list for five consecutive years. It is a direct result of Nashville’s ability to attract new companies and investment with our welcoming environment and quality of life.”

Trends highlighted in the report include the fact that attention should be given to the prospects for an extended downshifting in the economy and its implications for commercial property demand in the decade ahead; specialization has become “the hallmark of real estate”; and housing affordability has reached the breaking point even in markets that previously boasted of low-cost housing.

Of note, the live-work-play districts that spurred 24-hour downtowns in the 1990s have spread to many suburban communities, which are seeking to become hip destinations, or “hipsturbs,” the report notes.

The reports notes there is a growing commitment to the tenets of ESG (environmental, social and governance) principles among corporations in general — and in real estate in particular. Sustainability evaluation is becoming a checklist item for institutional investors domestically and worldwide. Strong interest by millennials in environmentally and socially conscious business practices is a major factor driving the trend.

In addition to the top five markets, other cities of note for 2020 include Dallas/Fort Worth, Orlando, Atlanta, Los Angeles, Seattle and Tampa/St. Petersburg.

New categories of markets to watch were added this year. These include the following:

• Major Capital Magnets: Manhattan, Chicago, Inland Empire (California), Northern New Jersey, Houston, Phoenix, San Diego, Oakland/East Bay (California) and Miami. “These markets accounted for more than 17 percent of total U.S. real estate transactions over the past three years,” the report notes.

• Stalwarts, Surprises and Determined Competitors: Philadelphia, Long Island (N.Y.), Fairfield County (Connecticut), Queens, Bronx and Staten Island (N.Y.), Minneapolis/St. Paul, Sacramento, Kansas City, Las Vegas, Baltimore, District of Columbia and Detroit. All have a “credible track record of capital inflows and recent evidence of solid transaction volume.”

• Treasures Ripe for Discovery – Jacksonville, Salt Lake City, Columbus, Cincinnati, Louisville, Pittsburgh, Greenville (S.C.), Oklahoma City, Cape Coral/Fort Myers/Naples (Florida), Boise, Spokane, Des Moines, Tacoma and Jersey City. “All have populations exceeding 1 million (the litmus test for some national investors) and double-digit growth rates.”

Now in its 41st year, Emerging Trends in Real Estate includes interviews and survey responses from more than 2,200 real estate industry experts, including investors, fund managers, developers, property companies, lenders, brokers, advisers and consultants.

ULI Nashville will host its Emerging Trends in Real Estate 2020 program on Nov. 22.

Property tax rates. Debt payments. Operating budgets.

From protests on the steps of the Metro Courthouse to power broker lunches at Midtown Cafe, the state of the city finances is the conversation permeating every corner of Nashville.

The swirling conversation about city finance affects everyday life for Nashvillians —everything from a proposal for an unprecedented increase in annual property taxes to the salaries for public school teachers and even how we pay to park hangs in the balance.

How did a city thriving by so many economic metrics reach a point where it must sell an old fire hall in Green Hills or privatize its downtown energy system to meet its budget?

Construction cranes color the Nashville skyline and Fortune 500 companies may be hurrying to open corporate headquarters here, but there’s a growing chorus of residents, mayoral candidates and other stakeholders who argue that the city is in a precarious financial situation.

The head of the school board’s budget committee called it a cruel paradox.

“As you know, Nashville’s economy is doing very well. In fact, doing so well that many employees cannot afford to stay here,” school board member Anna Shepherd told the Metro Council in her pitch for the district's proposed $76.7 million budget increase.

But understand, she said, that the request doesn't come close to ""fully funding"" Nashville schools.

""We would not be so bold to bring that before you without being secure in the knowledge that the city was ready for that level of investment,"" Shepherd said.

She said funding the budget the school board approved would merely show a measure of respect for district employees and make modest investments in critical areas.

""It allows us to tread water all while looking forward to the day when our city resources match the need of our children,"" Shepherd said.

How did Nashville end up in this situation?

TAXES AND THE CAMPAIGN: Where Nashville's top mayoral candidates stand on a proposed property tax increase

Dean: The economic development mayor

Start with the decisions made a decade ago under former Mayor Karl Dean’s administration.

Dean left office with a remarkably high favorability rating, credited by many in the business community for deftly navigating the 2008 Great Recession and the historic flood in May 2010 in a way that set Nashville up to become an international ""it city.""

Supporters say Nashville is in excellent financial position because of Dean. Property values are skyrocketing, and tourism-fueled sales tax collections continue to increase.

In the last year alone, Amazon and AllianceBernstein have joined the list of notable companies coming to Music City.

Dean ran for election in 2007 on the promise of not raising property taxes. The former public defender and city legal director kept that promise in his first term.

When the recession hit, Dean and his team of advisers, led by Finance Director Rich Riebeling and Deputy Mayor Greg Hinote, had to cobble together a budget that, for the first time in the history of Metro government, featured declining overall revenues.

To meet its budget during those difficult years, Dean eliminated open positions, laid off some staff and refinanced debt. Those moves created breathing room.

Beginning in January 2010, the city went on offense. Dean successfully pushed a financing plan for the $623 million Music City Center through the council, and in his second term, began aggressively offering incentives to recruit major companies to move here or to help existing corporations expand.

After the flood did billions of dollars in damage, Dean’s team did its part to stimulate the economy. Looking back, his advisers say those moves worked.

Dean raised property taxes once during his eight years in office, a modest 23-cent increase in 2012. By the time his tenure ended, Nashville was attracting major tourism investments with new hotels, restaurants and music venues.

The strategy of investing in tourism and corporate relocations, combined with maintaining a low tax rate, helped turn the Nashville economy from struggling to thriving.

When Dean navigated his early budgets, a hypothetical 1-cent tax increase represented about $1.5 million in revenue for the city. In 2019, that same increase would bring in $3 million, according to an analysis by The Tennessean.

Across Davidson County, property values have shot up and up.

More big-ticket items like a new Nashville Sounds baseball stadium and a renovated downtown riverfront, including a new amphitheater, earned Dean the reputation as Nashville’s economic development mayor.

His advisers say those decisions helped more than just downtown.

“As the city came out of the recession, we saw new developments arising across the city as it invested in its largest project in history, the overwhelmingly successful Music City Center,” Riebeling said.

“It was that same belief in investing in yourself that provided many of the decisions to provide incentives to some of Nashville’s leading employers such as HCA and Bridgestone that made significant new investments in our city.""

The city’s investment generated thousands of jobs and also spurred growth in other parts of the city, in areas like Madison and Antioch with the Ford Ice Center.

Decisions coming home to roost

But now, the decisions made by Dean are coming home to roost.

The deferred debt payments, thanks to his refinancing decision, are now ballooning.

Although overall tax revenues increased by an estimated $103 million over last year, the city doesn’t have the full benefit of that growth because $44.1 million will go to the escalating debt payments, much of it from the refinancing.

Because the city has raised taxes just once in the last decade, Nashville’s tax rate is among the lowest in Tennessee and in the nation compared with peer cities.

Not everybody is looking back on the Dean era so favorably.

Emily Evans, who served on the Metro Council during Dean’s tenure in office, said it would have been fine for Dean to simply tighten his belt after the recession and flood, or for him to raise taxes in conjunction with property reappraisals and invest more in big-ticket projects.

“But when you don’t raise taxes and you spend more, that’s when you have a problem,” Evans said, adding that the decision to refinance debt was especially problematic. “Our property taxes in absolute relative terms are not high.

“A little tweak of them probably could have saved us a lot of heartache,"" she said, highlighting how the debt payments have since skyrocketed to compensate for when they were low during the Dean years.

Will Pinkson, a Metro school board member — who has announced his resignation — said that while Dean focused on ""monuments,"" he let other basic functions of government, largely schools, ""basically dying on the vine.""

""I think what he did in his second term was just double down on bricks-and-mortar stuff and he forgot about everything else,"" said Pinkston, who served as district budget chair the past year until March when he unceremoniously resigned that post.

""It was all, 'Let's get an amphitheater. Let's get a ballpark. Let's get a sidewalk in the sky,' "" he said. ""I think it's great that they were done, and I think it adds value to the personality of the city, but at what expense and what cost? It's been considerable.""

Barry: The short-lived mayor

Dean’s successor, former Mayor Megan Barry, also eschewed a property tax increase as property and sales tax revenues grew. Barry’s administration focused on backing a public referendum to create dedicated funding for mass transit.

Schools, Pinkston said, also went on the back burner under Barry's leadership, when she put all of her chips and political capital on transit.

""When you're mayor, you want to affect the things you can affect,"" he said. ""And, at the time, the school system was in a lot of turmoil, much like it is right now. And she decided to just say, 'Let's go all in on transit' ... she was going to deal with schools at some point in the future.""

The decision, he said, created an environment in the city where there wasn't ""real discussion"" about revenue measures, until the city got past the ""big, financially overwhelming"" transit conversation.

""Strategically, I don't think it was a bad move,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, it didn't work out for anybody, including transit and her.""

Barry’s time in office was cut short by an affair and the scandal that culminated in a conditional guilty plea to felony theft and her resignation. Nashville voters defeated the transit referendum, and the city did not raise property taxes during her term.

Nashville had its reappraisal in 2017 during Barry's tenure, but failed to capture the growth when Barry decided not to raise property taxes, a typical move by Metro.

The combination of the decisions made in the decade, Nashville getting its major lick as the so-called ""it city,"" and the cost of living skyrocketing created an environment hard to dig out of politically and fiscally.

Briley: The replacement mayor

For the two previous years under Barry, revenue grew by $220 million, allowing the city to make major investments and avoid cuts. But in 2018, the overall growth flattened to $87.8 million, largely due to successful reappraisal appeals.

Nashville’s property reassessment in 2017 triggered an appeals process that caught officials off-guard. A greater portion of people were successful in their appeals than in 2013.

At the Metro Board of Equalization 64 percent had their values changed, while in 2013 the figure was 55 percent. The vast majority of those were revised downward, after the property owners made their case.

Instead of going on offense, Nashville Mayor David Briley has pushed ahead with a tighter budget.

Faced with lower-than-expected revenue and dwindling reserves, just two months after falling into the city's top job, Briley unveiled a $2.23 billion operating budget for the 2018-19 fiscal year — less than 1% over the previous year.

The budget fell more than $40 million short of the school district’s funding request and did not fulfill a cost-of-living salary increase promised to Metro employees.

Finance Director Talia Lomax-O’dneal called it a “real tight budget year,” with the administration’s goal to “balance the needs of the city.”

But Briley’s administration also banked on generating $38 million in new revenue.

To fill the gap, Briley proposed selling three publicly owned properties. That didn’t go so well. One property sold for less than the appraised value, and two didn't initially sell.

The move to make one-time sales to fill a budget hole has been met with resistance. The Metro Council unanimously passed an ordinance that takes effect in the new fiscal year prohibiting the sale of Metro land to cover operating expenses.

Briley also hoped to make up $15 million this past year by outsourcing the management of the city’s on-street parking — a decision met with even more overwhelming public disapproval. His opponents in the Aug. 1 mayoral election have tried to capitalize on that decision.

But unable to secure a deal in time, Metro filled the anticipated hole with money from the city's fund balance that closed higher than expected this year. Briley ""hit the pause"" button on the private parking deal, citing a need for a comprehensive discussion because of public confusion.

It's unclear how the Briley administration will replace the $34 million in upfront payments that was supposed to come from the parking deal.

How the budget impacts you

One of the most tangible ways the budget crunch affects Nashville residents is in the form of taxes. The Metro Council will have three property tax hikes to consider when it votes on a final budget Tuesday.

At-large council member Bob Mendes, for the second year in a row, is leading the charge for one proposal. Mendes and council member Anthony Davis are calling for a 52.5-cent property tax increase — about a 16.6% hike — to generate about $162.8 million in new revenue to help the city budget.

If the increase is approved, a property owner with a home appraised at $250,000 would pay about $328 more annually in taxes.

Council member Tanaka Vercher — who serves as Metro's Budget and Finance Committee chair — is seeking a 14.9% tax hike to generate $146 million more for the city.

For a home valued at $250,000, the Vercher proposal would mean an increase of about $296 per year.

Council member Steve Glover is proposing 3.5% property tax increase to generate about $34.34 million for the budget. Under his plan, it would cost about $69 more per year for homeowners of properties valued at $250,000

""The conventional wisdom in the courthouse is that the administration will propose a property tax increase next year — after the election,"" Mendes wrote in his blog. ""The administration’s proposed budget squeezes employees on pay and citizens on services in the meantime. It deepens problems when it should be creating capacity. It worries about opposition when it should be inspiring change.""

Political challenges often keep local governments from raising the property tax, leaving the question of how to pay for rising costs looming large. It's especially difficult to find support during campaign seasons.

""We hear, 'Let's get past the election and then we'll do the right thing,' "" said Brad Rayson, president of SEIU Local 205, the labor union that represents Metro employees and school district support staff. ""People are elected to be leaders. Making tough decisions is part of being a leader and doing the right thing and helping people understand.""

The current tax rate is $3.155 per $100 of assessed value in the Urban Services District, the lowest rate in the history of Metro government, coming under 1968's $5.30 rate.

The closest to Davidson County is Wilson County's rate of $3.51. The highest in the state is Shelby County with a rate of $7.77.

Supporters of an increase argue that it would address the city's core revenue problem and fulfill commitments to Metro employees and deliver desperately needed funding for schools.

The average support staff employee in Metro Schools, Rayson said, earns about $24,000 a year — nowhere near enough to get by in Nashville.

But Briley remains opposed to a property tax increase, and his administration has been lobbying council members to vote against them at Tuesday's meeting.

With revenues up, and even more building permits being pulled, Briley said he doesn't want to further burden the taxpayers.

“This is not the right time to raise property taxes,” Briley said, adding that when the right time comes, he'll make a case to Nashville residents.

“It’s good for the people who live here, that they can spend that money on what they choose to spend it on,"" he said. ""It’s a good indicator that the city is not in a bad shape if we can lower the rate that far and essentially do what the city is doing.""

Being a blue city in a red state comes with its advantages. Nashville is able to attract companies with its vibrant entertainment industry, thriving restaurant scene, a progressive culture and a lower cost of living than larger, coastal cities — while it simultaneously enjoys the low-tax, pro-business reputation the state has developed.

""You get all the benefits of being in a pro-business, red state climate with respect to right-to-work status, low taxes, fiscal discipline,"" said New Jersey-based site selector John Boyd. Meanwhile, the ""Nashville brand (is) being an inclusive city, a progressive city, a city that is attractive to a millennial workforce, a city that is able to attract and retain the best talent from around the globe. ... It’s really a winning formula.""

But the blue city-red state dynamic is not without challenges. In addition to facing regular efforts to nullify or weaken new city laws from Republican state lawmakers, Nashville city and business leaders also risk feeling the brunt of state legislation seen by some as discriminating against LGBT individuals. Such bills could turn off progressives considering a Nashville move or drive away prospective business and revenue.

""You have this inclusive, welcoming city of Nashville trying to do all it can to attract and retain workers,"" Joe Woolley, CEO of the Nashville LGBT Chamber, said. ""The state really pushes back on that.""

A handful of bills proposed this year are on the radar of several companies moving to Nashville and those considering expansion or relocation to Tennessee, Woolley said. They see the bills as discriminatory and potentially harmful to recruiting talented workers to Tennessee.

One bill calls to recognize marriage only between a man and a woman. Another allows adoption agencies to avoid lawsuits if they refuse to place a child based on moral convictions, which could affect same-sex couples as well as others seeking to adopt a child. A third adds new language to a law about indecent exposure that originally referred to transgender individuals and restrooms, even though current law already covers all adults in public places.

While these bills don't necessarily present a ""doomsday scenario"" for company recruitment, they could make efforts more difficult, Boyd said.

""A lot of that could create unnecessary obstacles for your economic development professionals,"" Boyd said. ""People invested in the economic development success of Nashville would hope that these bills do not pass.""

Tennessee has 'dodged the bullet' — so far

Nashville's cultural amenities and economic development focus have helped it attract companies in the tech and finance sector in recent years and draw numerous expansions from companies headquartered on the coasts, areas long associated with progressive politics. In the past five years, several California-based companies, including KeepTruckin, IQTalent Partners, Wonolo, Eargo, Lyft, Eventbrite and Postmates, have opened sizable Nashville offices.

Most recently, New York-based AllianceBernstein chose Nashville for a new headquarters, London-based EY announced a new Nashville office, and Seattle-based Amazon committed to opening a new Nashville office that is expected to employ 5,000 workers.

""Especially in target sectors like technology, banking and finance, the corporate headquarters arena, that’s an area our clients are focused on,"" Boyd said. ""They want to be in areas that are consistent with that theme of being inclusive and friendly to top talent around the globe.""

Boyd said Tennessee ""dodged the bullet"" when its proposed bathroom bill failed to gain traction or widespread media attention in 2016 and 2017. The bill would have required students in public schools to use the bathroom corresponding with the sex on their birth certificate. In 2016, North Carolina passed a similar bill that also restricted protections for LGBT individuals and saw significant economic losses reaching $3.76 billion over a 12-year period, according to an Associated Press analysis. The bill has since been partially repealed.

Boyd said Raleigh is a North Carolina city that has been able to maintain its business appeal. It was named as a finalist for Amazon's second headquarters, but it also was overlooked for Apple's recent expansion. Boyd also compared Nashville's blue city scenario to Austin, located in very red Texas, which was chosen for a major Apple office in December.

""Texas has had its fair share of conservative social policies in recent years,"" Boyd said. ""That has not mitigated or slowed the growth we have seen.""

Costs to Tennessee

In 2016, the Tennessee legislature passed a counseling bill allowing therapists to deny clients based on ""sincerely held principles,"" a law deemed discriminatory to LGBT clients by the American Counseling Association. The state lost three bookings and $3.4 million in direct visitor spending as a result of the bill, according to the Nashville Convention & Visitors Corp. Eleven bookings decided to choose another city because of the counseling bill, costing the state more than $66 million.

A Tennessee business coalition formed in 2016, called Tennessee Thrives, to counter discriminatory policies that could harm the economy or reputation of the state, including the bathroom bill, according to the group. More than 450 business organizations joined.

The Nashville Area Chamber of Commerce has taken a position against the ""Tennessee Natural Marriage Defense"" bill filed this year, describing it as unnecessary after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on this issue in 2015. The chamber also is opposed to any bathroom bills related to transgender individuals.

""Unnecessary, unneeded discriminatory legislation really just provides a distraction from the good things going on in Middle Tennessee,"" Lee Harrell, the chamber's state policy vice president, said. ""Anything that is going to hinder or distract from Middle Tennessee being a very welcoming and open state for business is troubling. It's not that we think businesses will look at these bills as the factor on whether or not to expand or relocate, but certainly as a factor. ... We encourage policymakers to think about the long-term effects and the importance of Tennessee being a welcome and open state.""

Businesses scoping out Nashville are most concerned about finding the right workforce, though companies do consider legislation and culture related to inclusiveness, Nashville Area Chamber of Commerce CEO Ralph Schulz said. Companies have never walked away because of legislation, but the state has so far avoided passing legislation that damaged the ""open and friendly"" brand of Tennessee, he said.

""Businesses come here for a variety of reasons,"" Schulz said. ""They also want a workforce to follow them to these areas. To the degree that this form of legislation affects workforce, they are concerned.""

Rep. John Ragan, a Republican from Oak Ridge who sponsored the indecent exposure bill and a second bill concerning adoption, has said he is not concerned about the business impact if the bills are passed and is more focused on protecting religious freedom. Rep. Tim Rudd, R-Murfreesboro, who is sponsoring the still-active adoption bill, did not respond to questions about the business implications of his bill.

“It is important that we encourage and retain adoption agencies in Tennessee,” Rudd said in an emailed statement. “Freedom of religion is one of the founding principles of our nation, and House Bill 836 protects the rights of our faith-based child placement agencies, supporting their efforts as they work tirelessly to help more Tennessee children through the adoption process.""

While the Tennessee Thrives coalition garnered massive business support, few companies are willing to individually comment on specific legislation or Tennessee politics. AllianceBernstein recently joined with the Tennessee Equality Project and other groups to speak out against three bills proposed but declined to be interviewed further. Several other companies declined to comment at all on how the political environment in Tennessee affected their business recruitment or location plans.

The muted response is not surprising, Boyd said. Even when North Carolina dealt with legislation restricting protections for LGBT individuals, many of the conversations were behind the scenes or through joint statements.

""A company really has no benefit to really go out on a limb in any way that is not coordinated and part of an overall communications or branding strategy,"" Boyd said. ""Companies want to be as neutral as possible. They don’t want to be in the business of making enemies on the right or the left. Companies need to hire Republicans and Democrats; they need to sell their goods and services to Republicans and Democrats.""

While city business leaders and recruiters said the issue of discrimination and relevant legislation comes up in recruiting conversations, the office of Tennessee Economic & Community Development Commissioner Bob Rolfe disagreed.

Jennifer McEachern, a spokeswoman for Rolfe, said in an emailed statement that Rolfe had not discussed proposed legislation with any companies and that those conversations typically are not part of relocation and expansion conversations. She declined to respond to whether AllianceBernstein had asked related questions.

""Those topics are typically not a part of the discussion during the recruitment process; however, we are more than willing to answer questions or address any concerns a company might have as it considers Tennessee for its next project,"" McEachern said.

Woolley said that in addition to AllianceBernstein, Amazon and EY are among other companies that have been in touch with the LGBT chamber about state-level politics. Businesses often ask him whether the bills that concern them actually stand to be enacted.

""Should we be concerned? Is it just politics or is it something to be worried about passing?"" Woolley said. ""They always cite North Carolina.""

Whether these bills will become law is uncertain. Schulz said proposed bills that are perceived as discriminatory are not necessarily a problem, but those that become law can become one.

The defense of marriage bill has a fiscal note potentially exceeding $9 billion in a fiscal year related to legal fees, potential loss of federal funds and loss of state revenue. It has failed to move forward since February, when it was moved to the Senate Judiciary Committee and assigned to a House subcommittee.

Both the indecent exposure bill and the adoption bill advanced this month and will be heard in Senate committees on March 26. The sponsors of the indecent exposure bill amended the bill by removing references to transgender individuals.

The marriage and adoption bills have caused the greatest concerns to businesses, Woolley said.

""You are looking at trying to bring people to relocate from San Francisco or New York,"" Woolley said. ""The tech industry is trying to recruit and grow here. You have universities trying to attract. You have this very discriminatory adoption language that is stopping people from moving with their families to a state that would impose these.""

Perceptions of Nashville shift

Jeff Haithcoat, director of acquisitions and growth at the Vaco recruiting firm in Nashville, said companies including Warner Music and AllianceBernstein have asked about state legislation, but on the individual level, the questions are more general about city culture.

""They tend to focus more on questions like, what's the restaurant scene like, or what's the cost of living or what's the community in general,"" Haithcoat said. ""People want to know when they move somewhere they can be part of a community. Are there going to be people like me, whether that’s race or religion or sexual orientation.""

While Nashville may have been lumped together with other Southern and more conservative areas in the past, that is not the case today, Haithcoat said.

""Even 10 years ago there was probably more of that, preconceptions of Nashville being uber conservative, very Republican,"" Haithcoat said. ""Nashville, especially in the last five years, has gotten the reputation of being very welcoming, very progressive-minded.""

Similarly, Robert Half recruiter Eric South said he has not observed Nashville struggling with perception issues as a result of being in a socially conservative state.

""In the past six months, we've had people relocate here from the New England area, we've had people that have relocated from out west and California, we see a lot from the Midwest and Chicago,"" South said. ""Nashville is distinct compared to some other parts of the South. It’s a transplant city.""

Nashville is the new host city for Champion’s Week and the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series Awards, the annual postseason celebration that sees drivers, industry luminaries and celebrities alike strut the red carpet and formally crown the series champion. The Awards will be held Thursday, Dec. 5, at the Music City Center in downtown Nashville.

Other Champion’s Week events will be announced at a later date, but fans should expect to have more access at the Awards than ever before.

“This year, we set a course to look at everything we do through a different lens, including how we celebrate the champions of our sport,” said Steve Phelps, NASCAR President. “Nashville’s energy, vibrant entertainment scene, and deep-rooted lineage in motorsports informed our decision and we believe our fans and industry will embrace the move to the Music City.”

The formal postseason Awards is a tradition that stretches back to 1981, when the event was held in New York City. It relocated to Las Vegas in 2009 and will now call Nashville its home for 2019.

NASCAR and Nashville have a history, too. Fairgrounds Speedway in Nashville hosted 42 Monster Energy Series races from 1958-1984, with the circuit visiting twice a year from 1973-84. Tennessee native Darrell Waltrip made the venue his own personal playground, winning eight races there — including four in a row from 1981-83, and five of the last seven Cup races held there. Nashville also hosted what is now the Local Series Awards for a number of years.

“Nashville’s history with NASCAR is indisputable, and coupled with our event experience we are a perfect match for NASCAR Champions Week,” said Butch Spyridon, President and CEO, Nashville Convention and Visitors Corp. “We look forward to welcoming NASCAR back home to Music City.”

Additionally, dates for the NASCAR Xfinity Series, NASCAR Gander Outdoors Truck Series and NASCAR Regional, International and Local Awards will shift and be held before the Monster Energy Series Awards. Once again held at the Convention Center in Charlotte, North Carolina, the 2019 Xfinity Series and Gander Outdoors Truck Series Awards are Friday, Nov. 22, following by the Regional, International and Local Awards on Nov. 23.

Those events will be held the week after the NASCAR national series crown three champions in Miami, but before Thanksgiving.",[]

As the pilot episode of ""Bluff City Law"" aired Monday night, some viewers might wonder how the nickname was coined for the city of Memphis.

Memphis got its nickname because of the city's physical location, according to former Shelby County Historian Jimmy Ogle.

There are several bluffs along the Mississippi River near Memphis.

Located 60 miles away from downtown Memphis is the High Bluff in Fort Pillow, Tennessee. Forty miles north of Memphis is the Chickasaw Bluff, a high ground rising 50 to 200 feet above the Mississippi River.

The closest bluff to downtown Memphis is located at Madison Ave. near the University of Memphis Law School.

Out of the country’s 100 largest cities, Memphis ranks 87 when it comes to parks, according to one group’s annual report on the country’s best park systems.

The Trust for Public Land nonprofit ranks parks based on accessibility, investment, acreage, and amenities.

Memphis’ park system, comprising 194 parks, earned an improved ranking from last year. It was up four points from the 91st ranking Memphis received in 2018.

Memphis’ highest score was in acreage, where it earned 60 out of 100. That number is calculated based on median park size and the percentage of the city’s land dedicated to parks. Here 5 percent of the land is used for parks and recreation, according to the report. The national median is 15 percent.



Memphis scored significantly lower in the investment category with 30 out of 100. That score is based on the amount of public and non-profit spending that goes toward parks, as well as the number of hours volunteers invest in parks.

Lower still, is Memphis’ amenity score — 25 out of 100. The group awards points in this category based on the availability of six key park amenities. The amenities include basketball hoops, off-leash dog parks, playgrounds, recreation and senior centers, restrooms, and splash pads.

Based on the report, there are, 2.9 basketball hoops, 1.8 playgrounds, and .1 restrooms in parks per 10,000 residents. There are .3 splash pads and .6 dog parks per 100,000 residents. Recreation and senior centers rank in the highest percentile with .9 centers per 20,000 people.

Finally, in the access category, Memphis’ parks scored 20 out of 100. Accessibility is determined by the percentage of the population living within a 10-minute walk or a half mile of a park. Here 45 percent of residents live within that proximity to a park. The national average is 54 percent.

The report also breaks down accessibility based on demographics. It found that more low-income households here are within a half of mile of a park than both middle and high income households. Only 16,697 middle-income households, compared to more than 54,000 low-income households, are located within a half mile of a park.

Memphis Mayor Jim Strickland is one of more than 250 mayors across the country who have joined the Trust for Public Land’s 10 Minute Walk campaign. Organized in partnership with the National Recreation and Park Association and the Urban Land Institute, the campaign aims to bring a park within a 10-minute walk to every household in the country by urging mayors to adopt long-term strategies to improve equitable access to quality parks.

The report also lists five ideal quarter-mile-radius areas for new parks here. Those locations are near the intersections of Getwell and New Willow, Kirby and Mt. Moriah, Goodlett and Winchester, Perkins and Winchester, and Macon and Whitten.

Based on this year’s report, the U.S. city with the best park system is Washington, D.C., followed by Saint Paul, Minnesota; Arlington, Virginia; and Portland, Oregon.

Cities with the lowest-ranked systems include Oklahoma City, Charlotte, North Carolina; and Mesa, Arizona.",[]

An effort is under way to open a Freshwater Institute in Memphis, which would leverage the region's unique set of resources to study and protect freshwater sources more broadly.

The city of Memphis announced the institute proposal in a news release on Thursday, following a meeting where a group of stakeholders from local institutions, including the University of Memphis and Christian Brothers University, agreed to move forward with the concept.

The proposed institute is in a conceptual stage, but the vision is for a Memphis-based facility that could potentially become a local and national research and educational facility, city of Memphis Chief Operating Officer Doug McGowen said.

McGowen said the institute would aim to serve as a problem-solving organization.

""The possibilities are very exciting,"" McGowen said. ""Where better than Memphis, Tennessee, with the assets we have here?""

The idea for the institute rose out of talks about cooling sources for the Tennessee Valley Authority’s Allen natural gas plant in Memphis, when concerns were raised around a proposal to drill wells in the aquifer.

The University of Memphis Center for Applied Earth Science and Engineering Research (CAESER) is already leading a more specific five-year water quality study into potential threats to the Memphis Sand Aquifer, including breaches that allow contaminants to enter the drinking water supply.

Memphis Light, Gas and Water customers are funding that $5 million study, with an extra 18 cents tacked onto their monthly water bills since last year.

The Freshwater Institute is envisioned as a resource to study freshwater more broadly, where students and educators can participate in field experiments throughout the year. The facility would consist of a main office, education and engagement space and potential future satellite locations elsewhere in the region, according to a city news release.

“It’s the perfect opportunity with the Mississippi River and ground water that makes it the largest freshwater system in North America,"" CAESER Director Brian Waldron said in a statement. “Being in the middle of that places Memphis in the right place to do this.”

There isn't yet a committed funding source for the Freshwater Institute proposal.

Other partners in the Freshwater Institute project include Shelby County, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Tennessee Department of Environmental Conservation and the Mississippi River Parks Partnership, according to a city of Memphis news release.

The next steps toward establishing the institute are ""refining the mission and vision,"" and approaching other potential partners, McGowen said.

Meanwhile, a public meeting about initiatives aimed at curbing Memphis Aquifer contamination is scheduled for 6:30 p.m. April 8 at the Benjamin Hooks Central Library.

A proposed redesign of Tom Lee Park has raised ""some issues, some challenges and some problems"" for Memphis in May, said Jim Holt, president and CEO of the festival.

Holt said he will meet soon with the Memphis River Parks Partnership to discuss the issues and that he's hopeful they can be worked through.

“... For large-scale public gatherings you need, for the most part, flat, flexible space, which we currently have in Tom Lee Park,"" Holt said. ""The new plan has a lot of topographical changes and elevations and water features and structures, which is going to impact the capacity for our events.”

Tom Lee Park: Here's how Memphis students are reshaping Tom Lee Park

'Vibrant' redesign forming: Here's how you can see the plans

Carol Coletta, president of the Memphis River Parks Partnership, said she has no doubt that they will be able to come up with a plan that accommodates Memphis in May. She said the conversation about the park is constantly evolving.

“We have been working with Memphis in May for a year-and-a-half on the design of the park and we will continue to work with Memphis in May,"" she said. ""They're an important user in this park and we want to work it out. We want them to be there and be there forever, so it’s just a matter of working through the details.”

Holt said he doesn’t want to go into too many details of what parts of the plan will have to change to accommodate Memphis in May until after he’s met with the Memphis River Parks Partnership next week.

'Significant challenges' for BSMF, barbecue championships

The current Tom Lee Park has 17 acres of occupiable space. The redesign will have 15.9 acres of occupiable space, according to calculations done by Architecture, Inc. for Memphis in May. That’s a drop from 14.5 acres to 5.6 acres of grass and a drop from 6 to 4.6 acres of roads and parking. However, it is an increase from 2.5 to 10.3 acres of sidewalks.

The redesign also will have 7.5 acres of space not suitable for booths, tents or trailers due to trees, topography and a water feature, according to the specifications from Memphis in May's architect.

That creates ""significant challenges"" for an event that brings more than 100,000 attendees to the Beale Street Music Festival and 75,000 to the World Championship Barbecue Contest, Holt said.

The most significant impact will be to the barbecue contest, Holt said, which brings 250 individual teams to the park.

“The redesign will diminish the number of barbecue teams,” Holt said.

With a $137 million economic impact and $3.5 million in local tax revenues, Memphis in May isn’t likely to scale back anytime soon, Holt said.

Plan to be compared next week

Studio Gang, the architecture and urban design firm leading the redesign of Tom Lee Park, has produced their own test fits for Memphis in May. Those designs show three great lawns offering space for the stages in the Beale Street Music Festival with an increase in unobstructed square footage in front of the stages.

Two alternate plans for the barbecue contest can accommodate 285 teams in different sized booths, according to the Memphis River Parks Partnership.

Coletta said that next week, the two organizations will compare how their designers did the test fits and see what needs to change.

She’s never seen the redesign as a conflict between a beautiful park for everyday usage and having a space for Memphis in May, she said.

“I think it’s really incumbent upon us to have a park that will attract people 365 days a year and be a beautiful front door statement for our city and be a beautiful functional festival grounds,” Coletta said. “We’re going to continue to work toward that end and I believe we’ll get there.”

The beating heart of Memphis’ music scene is appropriately the official Home of the Blues: Beale Street.

The blues laid the historical foundation of this Downtown Memphis strip, propped up by joints like Blues Hall and B.B. King’s Blues Club. But visitors can find a variety of sights and sounds nowadays in Beale’s distinct mix of bars, restaurants and shops.

It took time for Beale to get on this firm of footing, despite its storied history. Here’s how Beale Street rose into a center of black culture and opportunity, fell into disrepair and then transformed into the locus of Memphis nightlife and tourism.

A Bluff City Bicentennial: From comic to tragic, here are 200 pieces of Memphis' history

Beale Street’s origins

Beale Street came up around the 1840s originally as Beale Avenue. While affluent white suburbs comprised Beale’s eastern end early on, shippers and cotton distributors drove the western portion, wrote developer John Elkington in “Beale Street: Resurrecting the Home of the Blues.”

Beale’s black population jumped due to Civil War displacements and Union Army occupation from 1862 to 1867, according to Elkington.

“…Beale Street had fully become the cultural center and the local headquarters for commerce, politics and religion for blacks,” he wrote. “From 1866 to 1874, twenty black-owned businesses and a Freedman’s Bank existed in the area.”

Yellow fever wiped out much of Memphis’ population later in 1878, leading to a devastated Beale Street. Robert Church, a wealthy former slave, bought up Beale-area land and opened the door to new economic opportunities for blacks.

Early life on Beale Street

Beale’s early nightlife featured plenty of fun, both legal and illegal. An eclectic mix of visiting country folks and high-end patrons concocted a swirl of drinking, gambling, pawning and prostitution in the district, wrote Robert Sigafoos in “Cotton Row to Beale Street: A Business History of Memphis.”

But Beale’s seedy reputation clouded its reality as a welcome escape for black people, who weren’t welcome on Main Street. The black community could enjoy entertainment, restaurants and support black business, said Elaine Turner, founder of Heritage Tours in Memphis.

“[Beale Street's] patrons did their shopping for food and clothes there, saw their doctors, dentists and lawyers there, paid their burial insurance there,"" wrote Margaret McKee and Fred Chisenhall in “Beale Black and Blue: Life and Music on Black America’s Main Street.” ""Many a Beale Streeter lived out his life without setting foot in Beale’s saloons and gambling dens.”

Not to be ignored are Beale Street’s Chinese merchants at the time. Chop Suey Café, opened by Chu C. Lau and Chu Lain as Oriental Café, ran for 47 years before closing in 1967, per Shelby County historian Jimmy Rout III. Chinese-owned laundries and grocery stores also had a presence.

Music's rise on Beale Street

But early Beale’s most lasting impact is perhaps its many music clubs. Those working in the Mississippi Delta brought to Memphis a style that has stuck to this day.

“Their Delta Blues was characterized by strong singing and hard dance rhythms, which came from their traveling in minstrel shows or playing in juke joints for dancing couples,"" wrote blues musician Edward “Prince Gabe” Kirby in “From Africa to Beale Street.”

Composer W.C. Handy may not have been the first bluesman, but he took the Blues sound and put it on paper in the early 1900s. He wrote an influential campaign song for E.H. ""Boss"" Crump later known as ""The Memphis Blues,"" along with ""Beale Street Blues.""

Following Handy's prime, the post-Prohibition Jazz Age introduced Beale and the world to iconic talents like B.B. King, Louis Armstrong, Muddy Waters and many more.

Beale's decline

After the heyday of Beale Street’s blues era, Beale Street slid into a slump that would last for more than a decade. Newspaper articles at the time described it as a ""ghost town.""

At the end of the 1960s, the Memphis Housing Authority was beginning a targeted urban renewal effort that included Beale Street. The section of Beale Street between Second and Fourth streets had been declared a National Historic Landmark in 1966.

Those planned projects, including Beale, were among what the MHA considered “some of the city’s worst remaining slums,” according to a June 1971 Press-Scimitar story.

In some cases, neighborhoods were cleared to make way for other projects, according to an exhibit at Memphis’ Rock ‘N’ Soul Museum.

“Local black merchants, business owners and residents were devastated by their displacement from their original stores, restaurants and night spots that had made Memphis so unique,"" the exhibit states. ""The millions of dollars that were poured into urban renewal succeeded in creating some low-income housing, but the goals were never fully realized. Some areas were simply deserted after being razed.”

Redeveloping Beale Street

After years of calls for African-American involvement in the Beale Street restoration, the nonprofit Beale Street Development Corp. was founded in 1973, with a mission of bringing the races together to revitalize the street.

""If specific plans aren't made to include us (black entrepreneurs), just the simple process of business will exclude us,"" then-Councilman Fred L. Davis told Memphis Housing Authority commissioners, according to the 1971 Press-Scimitar story.

In the early 1980s, Memphis city officials decided on the firm led by developer John Elkington, and awarded the company a decades-long contract, which tasked them with finding tenants and coordinating construction.

It took years to make money, and during that time, it was sometimes a challenge to make payroll, Elkington said.

In the early days of the redevelopment phase, there was a lot of turnover, and businesses were “undercapitalized,” Elkington said.

“No one ever believed we would stay in business,” he said.

Change came in bursts, and there were multiple pivotal moments. Elkington called B.B. King’s Blues Club coming in during the late 1980s a turning point, and that combined with Doe’s Eat Place going in across Beale “established that corner,” he said.

Moving Silky O’Sullivan’s to Beale from Overton Square, where it had been a fixture, was another big moment, Elkington said.

When chain restaurants expressed interest in occupying space on Beale, they were often sent elsewhere.

“It was important we tried to keep it as authentic as possible,” Elkington said.

The New Year’s Eve celebration taking off during the early 1990s, parades on Beale and redoing Handy Park were also big moments through the redevelopment period, Elkington said.

Rout, the historian, remembers seeing Beale Street start to surge again around the turn of the century, when a new generation of Memphians had grown up through the redevelopment period, were coming of age and able to patronize Beale’s nightlife spots.

“It was the place to go, it was the party place,” Rout said.

Around the same time, the managers, developers and the city got locked in a legal fight over the management of Beale, which would last for years. Elkington’s firm later became known as Performa Entertainment. In 1999 the city sued the Beale Street Development Corp. for breach of lease; BSDC then sued Performa for the same reasons, and Performa countersued both. Performa and the city of Memphis settled litigation in 2010, a day before they were scheduled to go to court.

More recently, controversy reared up again when the Memphis City Council passed an as-needed cover charge to enter the Beale Street Entertainment District on particularly crowded nights.

The city of Memphis took back public control of Beale Street in 2014, and directed the Downtown Memphis Commission to handle day-to-day management of the street on an interim basis.

Many of the current leases on Beale extend out more than a decade, but the city is expected to choose a permanent operator at some point. Since the Downtown Memphis Commission took over the management, two or three new tenants have come in on the historic street, but other than that, the businesses have been long-term tenants and ""little to no turnover at all,"" said Jon Shivers, director of Beale Street.

An app allows visitors to view details about some of Beale Street's marquee buildings, and the stories behind the musicians on the brass notes that line its sidewalks.

""We’d like to develop that even more and make it into a historic walking tour, where someone can download the app and it’s a truly interactive walking tour,"" Shivers said.

For Beale Street business owner Sandy Robertson, the future of the historic street should continue preserving its past, and it's still all about the music.

""It's a music street, it's known for music and people come down here to hear music. They love live music,"" Robertson said. ""So I think that's the road we stay on.""

On Monday, Richmond city council approved the permanent installation of a rainbow crosswalk on Minoru Boulevard, adjacent to the Richmond Library and Cultural Centre (RLCC) and the City Hall Annex — immediately southwest of CF Richmond Centre shopping mall.

The location was chosen because of its high pedestrian traffic, and it will replace the existing crosswalk in the area. It will also complement the rainbow-painted stairs at the main entrance of the RLCC.

“The city values diversity in the community as one of its fundamental strengths and understands that the work of creating a fully inclusive society is ongoing and there is a need to expand people’s ideas about gender and sexual expression,” reads a city staff report.

The new functional public art installation is expected to cost $15,000, and it will be made ready by July 29, 2019, to coincide with Pride Week.

As well, the city staff report notes a separate community grassroots initiative has funded the $750 cost to paint Cambie Community Centre’s outdoor basketball court’s three-point line in rainbow colours for Pride Week.

There are currently 43 cities across the province with LGBTQ rainbow crosswalks or other physical visual representations, including rainbow crosswalks in Vancouver, Surrey, Coquitlam, New Westminster, and White Rock.

Richmond’s approval follows the recent completion of a rainbow crosswalk in Port Moody, and the approval of four rainbow crosswalks in Burnaby.

Delta is also currently in the process of considering a similar crosswalk installation.

Arlington County Board Chair Christian Dorsey and Del. Mark Levine stomped on the sign honoring Confederate President Jefferson Davis, folding it up as crews placed the first new “Richmond” signs in Crystal City this morning at the 23rd Street S. intersection.

“It felt great,” Dorsey said afterward. “We are at a point now where we don’t have to have these monumental signs hanging over the streets of Arlington.”

Arlington’s lawmakers have pushed for the change for several years, but were stymied by conservative representatives in Richmond. The county renewed its efforts last year in the wake of Amazon’s arrival.

Earlier this year, at the prompting of Del. Mark Levine, Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring issued an opinion that local leaders could sidestep Richmond entirely. The opinion clarified that the Arlington County Board had the authority to change the name on its own.

In an statement Wednesday, Levine wrote that today’s event was important because the General Assembly named the highway after Davis long after the Civil War — in 1922 — and Davis himself few connections with Virginia.

“The purpose instead was to terrorize Virginia’s black population into submitting to unconstitutional second-class legal status under Virginia law,” said Levine. “In 1922, Jim Crow laws, lynching, and the KKK were at their peak power, while poll taxes, literacy tests, and grandfather clauses kept the descendants of the courageous African-Americans who fought Davis and died for the Union from exercising their constitutional right to vote.”

“While it is necessary for us to honestly discuss and interpret Virginia’s history, I feel strongly that commemorating the president of the Confederacy through the name for a major thoroughfare is not appropriate,” Virginia’s Commonwealth Transportation Board Secretary said after approving the name change in May.

The highway was named after Davis at the request of the United Daughters of the Confederacy, a group which sponsored confederate monuments across the south in the 20th century, including a now-removed plaque in Bluemont Park. In 1946, the group also commissioned a stone marker along the highway bearing Jefferson Davis’ name, which county or state transportation officials are not quite sure what to do about.

“I’m proud of Mark Levine for getting this through,” said Freddie Lutz, owner of longtime Crystal City LGBT bar Freddie’s Beach Bar, who attended this morning’s ceremony. “It’s a great, progressive move. I’m all about celebrating diversity.”

“It’s been a long time coming,” Levine said. “It’s a sign of oppression. It was wrong to put it up [then] and it was wrong today.”

Levine added that having himself and Dorsey personally take the Jefferson Davis sign down “wasn’t planned that way, but it’s wonderful symbolic justice.”

Officials previously estimated that total cost of changing Jefferson Davis Highway to Richmond Highway in Arlington would be around $17,000, and that work would continue through October.

Alexandria voted to nix the name last year. Earlier this year Google Maps began display the new name on the Arlington portion of the highway.

“We are thrilled about the overdue name change,” Tracy Sayegh Gabriel, President of the Crystal City Business Improvement District, told ARLnow. “It’s much more consistent with our values — and provides a progressive and inclusive environment to live and work.”

After requesting the numbers from all three through the Freedom of Information Act Request, Henrico and Chesterfield quickly handed them over, but Richmond refused.

""This is what astounds me, is that really an option?"" Richmond resident Daniela Shew said.

Technically, yes, the city can decline to release the information because the law does not mandate the disclosure of individual personnel's overtime pay - but the law doesn't say they can't be released.

The city's decision doesn't sit well with taxpayers we spoke to.

""We need to see that,"" Richmond resident Barbara Womack-Bradby said.

""It makes you suspicious. It appears that they're trying to hide something,"" Shew said.

Especially after they saw a city audit from January.

The audit found that in 2017, 57 employees received more than 700 hours of overtime pay ranging up to 1,889 hours of OT.

According to our calculations, the highest among them would have had to work 8 extra hours for day for 236 days to make that kind of OT.

It also found that no supporting documentation was provided for 20 percent of overtime payments the auditor's office researched.

""We have to own it and fix it,"" Councilwoman Kim Gray, who represents the 2nd district, said.

The audit plus the denial of our request concerned Gray enough that she penned a letter to the Mayor Thursday asking that he release the OT numbers.

""I find it important for the public and members of the media to have that information because often times they catch things that maybe within City Hall we don't see, and that information is valuable when you're trying to find savings in a budget,"" Gray said.

Gray said she asked the City Attorney why they declined to release this information. She says she was told that they were concerned about the information being tied to identifiable individuals.

CBS 6's FOIA request did not include a request for individual names, but instead asked for positions, base pay and overtime.",[]

• Lights and sirens that shut off automatically when the vehicle is put into park.

• Windows that come down when the interior gets too hot.

• Cameras that record activity in front and behind a vehicle.

These are just a few examples of the whiz-bang technology a small team of Richmond electronic specialists are installing in cars, trucks and other motorized equipment belonging to the city and other governmental entities.

Led by supervisor D.C. Creasy, the team that also includes two other full-time and one part-time staff works out of the City of Richmond Radio Shop, also known as the Technical Division of the Department of Emergency Communications. It’s located at 3506 Hopkins Road in South Side.

“These days, it’s a lot more than radios,” said Karen L. Gill, spokesperson for Emergency Communications.

The division’s budget is tiny, about $1.3 million a year, while the productivity ranks high among city agencies.

In the course of a year, the Radio Shop staff will work on hundreds of vehicles, ranging from dump trucks and school buses to fire trucks, paint trucks and police cars, boats and motorcycles.

“The only thing we have not worked on is an aircraft,” Mr. Creasy said.

Communications between vehicles and with call centers are still a mainstay. The team is at the center of the $40 million city project now underway to replace public safety communications equipment in police cars, fire trucks, ambulances and other vehicles.

The city’s overhaul of public safety communications, which is expected to be completed in 2021, is part of a regional effort to make it easier for police officers, firefighters and public safety employees from different agencies to talk with one another and a dispatcher. The total cost across the region could top $150 million.

The technicians not only work on city vehicles, but they also install sensors, technology and communications equipment into vehicles belonging to Virginia Commonwealth University, Virginia Union University, the Richmond Ambulance Authority and the Richmond Metropolitan Transportation Authority, among others, Mr. Creasy said.

These organizations get vehicles from the manufacturer as basic models, just as an individual might order, Ms. Gill said. The vehicles are then sent to the division’s shop to be upgraded with the technology that turns them into specialized vehicles.

For example, the city fire marshal’s SUV has been equipped with sensors that monitor conditions in the space in which dogs that assist in arson investigations ride.

The team also adds specialized lighting to police detectives’ cruisers.

“The technology is so detailed now, we can do really crazy stuff on the computer,” Mr. Creasy said. “We get to build some really cool things. We get to make different light patterns and functions and put them where you can’t even see them. We’re pretty good at hiding stuff.”

Mr. Creasy said he and his staff work with governmental customers to learn about problems they might have and to find solutions, such as the automatic shutoffs of sirens and lights for ambulances.



That has been his focus, he said, since he moved into the Richmond shop in 2015 after working as an installer in Chesterfield County’s radio shop. Promoted to supervisor in 2017, he said the ability to solve problems is the top skill he looks for in hiring technicians.

“Our people have to think on the fly to problem solve,” Mr. Creasy said. “If things are not working when they should be, the people in our shop have to figure out why. If we can’t get the parts we need, then we make them. If what we’re doing isn’t working, we have to change how we work.”

He said the trend has been for governmental agencies to outsource radio work. But he said the city’s radio shop has proven itself. He said few private shops can match the city team’s ingenuity, speed and experience in electronics, mechanics and metal fabrication.

Plus, the work is fun for people who like working on cars and trucks, Mr. Creasy said.

“Instead of fixing the brakes, changing oil filters or repairing engines, our team gets paid to install cameras in vehicles,” he said. “Who wouldn’t like that?”",[]
https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/us/richmond-virginia-a-city-still-enslaved-by-its-confederate-past-1.3835454,"['Richmond, VA']","Richmond, Virginia: a city still enslaved by its Confederate past","Two hours’ drive south of Washington DC, the factory chimneys and elevated rail tracks of Richmond appear on the horizon.

The capital city of Virginia, Richmond was once the industrial heartland of the region. It also holds an important place in American history. After war broke out between the Union north and the Confederate south in 1861 and Virginia seceded from the Union, Richmond became the capital of the Confederacy, due in part to its strategic location as a major transport and logistical hub for steamboats and railroads.

More than 150 years on from the American Civil War, Virginia’s complex legacy on race, slavery and power continues to haunt the state.

Virginia was plunged into crisis this year when pictures emerged of governor Ralph Northam in a college yearbook. Northam admitted he was one of two people in a photograph – one dressed as a Ku Klux Klan member, the other in “blackface” – though he later said he was not sure either of the people was him.

Further scandal ensued when the second-in-command at the state legislature, lieutenant governor Justin Fairfax, was accused of sexual assault, while the third most senior ranking Democrat, state attorney-general Mark Herring, admitted that he wore blackface at a college party in 1980. Herring had initially called for Northam’s resignation.

The final upshot was that all three have kept their positions, but the controversy has threatened to undermine the legitimacy of the Democratic Party in the state, which has made major electoral strides in recent years fuelled in part by anti-Trump sentiment.

Race relations

The fact that Northam has kept his job – despite widespread calls to resign from senior figures in the Democratic Party including Nancy Pelosi and his predecessor Terry McAuliffe – illustrates the idiosyncrasies of Virginia’s relationship with its past when it comes to race relations.

One of the first states established after British settlers arrived in Jamestown in 1607, Virginia’s rapid development as a political and economic hub was bound up with a parallel history of repression and slavery. This year the state will mark the 400th anniversary of the arrival of the first slaves from west Africa to English-speaking America. In 1619, a ship docked in Fort Monroe, just outside Richmond, carrying a cargo of enslaved Africans.

Over subsequent centuries the economy of the new world, particularly in the south, grew exponentially, powered by the economics of free slave labour. The port city of Richmond was at the heart of this thriving industry. By the time of the Civil War – a war essentially fought over slavery – Richmond was home to the second-largest slave market in the country.

Slave-dealers took rooms in the nearby hotels, while slaves were kept in filthy underground holding facilities nearby

Today, in downtown Richmond, the story of Virginia’s history – and of America itself – is evident in the urban spaces and public buildings. Presiding over the city is the impressive Virginia State Capitol. Designed by Thomas Jefferson, one of the founding founders of the American republic and the third American president, the neoclassical building reflected the confidence of a new democracy.

Half a mile away, just under a busy underpass, stands a small sign with the words “Slave Auction Site”. It was here that hundreds of thousands of slaves were bought and sold throughout the 18th and 19th centuries. Slave-dealers and merchants took rooms in the nearby hotels, now long gone, while slaves were kept in filthy underground holding facilities nearby.

Dark chapter

Today, there are few signs of the industry that once dominated this part of the city. But the memories of this dark chapter of the city’s past are never far from the surface.

Richmond’s troubled history is also on display in the visual iconography of the city in other ways. Just west of the centre is Monument Avenue, a grand boulevard dotted with statues to southern “heroes” of the American Civil War. The first statue, a memorial to Robert E Lee, was erected in 1890 – part of a process of cultural appropriation in the south that sought to celebrate the pro-slavery Confederate leaders in the decades after the war.

Despite the events in nearby Charlottesville in the summer of 2017, which saw far-right neo-nazis flock to the city’s Confederate statues, prompting national outrage, most of Virginia’s monuments still stand. Last month a Bill to grant local authorities the power to remove statues was defeated. For now, it seems, they are here to stay.

As the Ralph Northam controversy shows, despite efforts at reconciliation and remorse in recent decades, Virginia is not quite able to leave its past behind.",[]
https://tulanehullabaloo.com/47552/views/new-orleans-must-find-new-ways-to-preserve-its-history/,['New Orleans'],New Orleans must find new ways to preserve its history • The Tulane Hullabaloo,"It is uncanny how visiting the city before and after Hurricane Katrina, the comparatively touristy parts of the city recovered to almost exactly how they were before. With tourism as a central part of the city’s economy, New Orleans throws a lot of money at retaining its appeal to visitors, maintaining one of the most well-preserved cultural centers of art, music and architecture.

The city, however, is also struggling to reconcile what that means going forward. With the recent debate over whether to remove Confederate war symbols, many residents have opened their eyes to the possibility that not all preservation is good preservation. New Orleans now faces the challenge of both maintaining its heritage and still being able to evolve socially.

How? Festivals. One of the first things every Tulane student hears from an enthusiastic tour guide is the quick fact that New Orleans allegedly has more individual festivals than there are days of the year. Festivals themselves have long since been an fundamental part of the culture of the city. Additionally, the integration of new festivals and the evolution of the existing ones have allowed New Orleans to keep its heritage, while still including new social values and ideas.

Two weekends past provides a great example. The French Quarter Festival, which first started in 1984, is a large gathering of art and music celebrated in the most historic part of the city. With the art coming from all different types of artists in both modern and traditional styles, ever since the beginning, French Quarter Fest has exemplified the path New Orleans has been able to find in combining its incredible heritages with the new and constantly changing culture of its inhabitants.

Southern Decadence is another festival that has found its way in as part of the expanding social sphere. The festival, sometimes dubbed “the gay Mardi Gras” started in 1972 by an increasingly prevalent LGBTQ community. The festival utilizes the historic venue of the French Quarter, and it capitalizes on the tourist and party capacities of the city to host six-day-long celebration of diversity. The rise of the festival marks the dramatic evolution of the city’s culture.

Lastly, the biggest exhibition of New Orleans’s dedication to preserving its cultural heritage arrives this weekend during the Jazz and Heritage Festival. The Jazz and Heritage Festival was initially hosted on the site of Congo Square, the historic heart of the city’s African American community.

When created, the festival was designed to celebrate the music and culture that originated in New Orleans and Louisiana. Jazz Fest is a particularly good example of how the city has expanded culturally while still valuing its heritage because of how big its grown. Jazz Fest was moved to the fairgrounds because its original location became too small to hold the full extravaganza. Rather than switching out the older or less common music styles for modern popular music, the festival just grew. Now music at the festival includes everything imaginable, from jazz to rock to pop to folk and any number of other genres. The festival little by little incorporated all the aspects of the cities growing culture.

New Orleans has to decide how to handle the physical preservation of its history. The preservation of its cultural heritage, however, will live on as long as the city’s residents continue to find ways to celebrate it. It is often said that New Orleanians will find any excuse to party, but maybe it’s better to say that New Orleanians are proud and happy to live in their city.",[]

Even as Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans, the Mississippi River’s levees held up when those in other parts of the city did not.

But as Tropical Storm Barry threatened New Orleans with torrential rains that will test the city’s flood defenses this weekend, the height of the city’s river levees was the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ greatest concern, spokesman Ricky Boyett said Thursday.

Full Coverage: Tropical Storm Barry

The danger to New Orleans — bound by the Mississippi River on its south side, Lake Pontchartrain on its north side and tributaries leading into the nearby Gulf of Mexico on the east — is threefold: storm surges from the sea, rain from the sky and water from the rising river if the levees fail.

ADVERTISEMENT

While the Corps wasn’t expecting the swollen river to spill over into the city, the threat from Barry was real with a storm that was forecast to dump 10 to 20 inches (25 to 50 centimeters) of rain on New Orleans through Sunday, with isolated areas getting 25 inches (64 centimeters).

The river was expected to crest at about 19 feet (5.8 meters) on Saturday in New Orleans, where the levees protecting it from the water range from about 20 to 25 feet (6 to 7.5 meters) in height, said Jeff Graschel, a hydrologist with the National Weather Service.

The weather service also was expecting the water to stay below the river’s levees, which haven’t been overtopped in New Orleans since the early 1920s. But state officials warned that a change in the storm’s direction or intensity could change that.

To prepare, workers were shoring up at least two areas along the city’s levee system, Boyett said. They piled up “stoplogs,” or metal beams, and topped them with sheet metal to add height to Harvey Lock, a break in the levee across the river from the city’s Lower 9th Ward, which was all but wiped out during Katrina. Workers also used Hesco baskets, a type of flood barrier, to add 3 feet (almost 1 meter) to the river levee at the Corps’ headquarters in New Orleans.

“We’re confident in the integrity of the levees,” Boyett said. “They’re designed to hold this pressure.”

But 14 years after Katrina’s monster storm surge roared ashore and inundated most of the city, many New Orleans residents still distrust the Corps, which built the levees and floodwalls that failed near Lake Pontchartrain and along the Lower 9th Ward.

While the levees protecting the city from the Mississippi River held during the August 2005 storm, the flooding was exacerbated by the size and configuration of a shipping channel that the Corps dredged decades ago between New Orleans and the Gulf of Mexico.

“The models for Hurricane Katrina were all wrong,” said Levees.org president Sandy Rosenthal, who founded the grassroots organization shortly after Katrina. “We don’t care what the model says. The model is an educated guess. That’s all it is.”

Residents waited nervously as the storm approached.

Cooter Brown’s Tavern, a popular bar less than one-quarter mile from the Corps’ headquarters in New Orleans, didn’t flood during Katrina. But co-owner Ivan Burgess said they were debating whether to stay open or close this weekend given concerns about Barry’s flood risks.

“We’ve been really lucky, but that’s only part of it. We have our employees’ safety to consider,” he said.

Author and historian John Barry, who served on a board that was created after Katrina to oversee the levee system of greater New Orleans on the east bank of the Mississippi River, said he was “very confident” in the structural integrity of the river levees and would be “astounded” if they breached.

“Because engineers built them correctly,” he added. “They were built against the worst-case scenario they could imagine.”

Here’s what can go into the bin for curbside recycling pickup:

Plastics: Only #1 (soda/water bottles) and #2 (milk/juice/shampoo/detergent containers);

Paper: Newspapers, junk mail, phone books, catalogs, office paper; corrugated cardboard, boxboard (cereal boxes/soft drink boxes);

Metal: Small aluminum and steel cans.

Plastics #3 through #7, wax board (juice boxes/milk cartons) and plastic bags will no longer be accepted by the city’s collection contractors. So the container that once held grated Parmesan or takeout probably can’t be recycled anymore. Check the number inside the triangle; Mardi Gras cups, for example, are generally #5 plastic.

You can also responsibly discard items by taking them to the city’s Recycling Drop-Off Center at 2829 Elysian Fields on the second and fourth Saturdays of each month from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m.

The next recycling drop-off day is this Saturday, May 25. In addition to everything that is accepted curbside, the city will also take old TVs, used batteries, empty wine bottles, those piles of Mardi Gras beads and more off your hands. Here’s what’s accepted:

The plastic, paper and metal listed above;

E-waste (computers, laptops, telephones/telephone systems, keyboards, speakers, telephone/computer cables, x-boxes, PlayStation, Wii, MP3/DVD/CD players, UPS, Circuit boards, Portable Navigation/GPS devices, ink jet/toner cartridges, digital cameras/video recorders (DVRs), fax machines, small printers, monitors, processors, networking equipment, stereos, security systems);

Batteries (AA, AAA, AAAA, C. D, 6 & 9 volt, lithium);

Light bulbs (incandescent and fluorescent);

Televisions (Limit 4);

Glass (Limit 50 pounds);

Tires (Limit: 5);

Mardi Gras beads;

Organics for composting: (fruit and vegetable scraps (peels, skins, pits, or seeds), tea bags, coffee grounds and paper filters, eggshells, nutshells, seed shells, plain bread, grains, and plan pasta (no toppings, meat bones, dairy or foods with oil).

Food and drink containers should be rinsed out before recycling. As always, Styrofoam, containers with food, and greasy pizza boxes are not accepted in the curbside program or at the Recycling Drop-Off Center. Don’t place your recyclables in plastic bags (bags are accepted for recycling in bins at some supermarkets).

The curbside recycling program in New Orleans was at risk of ending entirely. Metro Services Group, one of the city’s collection contractors, received notice from its recycling processor, Republic Services, that it would suspend acceptance of items from residential, single stream, curbside collections effective May 17, the Mayor’s Office stated in a press release.

Republic cited rising costs as a result of China’s ban on the imports of previously accepted types of recyclable materials and changes in contamination level requirements in the global market as the reason for the indefinite suspension.

This announcement required a rapid response by Metro Service Group to secure a change in processors. Although alternative arrangements were successfully completed, the suspension by Republic Services highlighted the current recycling situation on the national, regional and local level.

The city and its contractors scrambled to find a way to improve the marketability of recycled items and reduce contamination. That’s why it is no longer accepting plastics #3 through #7, wax board (juice boxes/milk cartons) or plastic bags at either curbside collection or the Recycling Drop-Off Center on Elysian Fields Avenue.

“We recognize just how important our recycling program is for our people and our city, so we worked alongside Metro, the local business community and our national resilience network to find a solution,” said Ramsey Green, Deputy CAO for Infrastructure and Chief Resilience Officer, in the press release.

Recycling is facing significant challenges. The city urges residents to reduce the amount and types of items purchased and to reuse items. Recent articles on recycling note that the majority of the material collected in recycling programs remains in the United States and is used in the production of consumer goods.

Green added: “We must all do our part to reduce contamination to assist collection, processing and manufacturing companies until new and expanded markets are developed. Although contamination from our area has not exceeded generally acceptable levels, it can be reduced further. It is our hope that these actions will assist in extending the life of the city’s recycling programs.”",[]
https://thelensnola.org/2019/07/01/new-orleans-becomes-first-major-american-city-without-traditional-schools/,['New Orleans'],New Orleans becomes first major American city without traditional schools,"On a typically hot July 1 in south Louisiana, when many students and educators are enjoying long holiday vacations, New Orleans has quietly become the first major American city without any traditional schools.

The Orleans Parish school district has teetered on the edge of an all-charter district for years. Each year the number of the district’s direct-run schools has dwindled as some have closed and others have converted or been taken over by charter organizations. During the 2018-2019 school year, the district ran just three schools directly, and that was only after unexpectedly taking control of two struggling charter schools.

The last school to convert, McDonogh 35 Senior High School, is doing so as part of a two-part plan to shut down the traditional school and restart it as a charter. The historic school needed a reset after years of declining scores, Superintendent Henderson Lewis Jr. said last year when he announced the changes.

“My goal is to bring McDonogh 35 back into its premiere position as an academically successful, first-tier high school and this is the best step forward,” Lewis said in December.

Each of the last three years, the district has been poised to become all-charter, but each time, charter groups have withdrawn applications to run schools, or district officials have decided to change course. The district wound up waiting an extra year to hand McDonogh 35 over to a nonprofit.

That group, InspireNOLA, has grown with a wave of charter operators that followed the state’s post-Katrina intervention in New Orleans’ public schools.

Charter schools in New Orleans are run by nonprofit groups that receive a contract from either the state or the district. In exchange for the ability to select curriculum, staff and set their own calendars, they must meet certain academic and financial standards each year. Charter schools receive a 5-year contract and if they pass an initial review after three years they are able to apply for a renewal. Renewal contracts can last anywhere between three and 10-years depending on the school’s performance.

The state-run Recovery School District took over dozens of the city’s schools in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, eventually closing or converting all of them to charter schools. Louisiana’s first charter school law was passed in 1995, but there were only a handful of charters in New Orleans before the storm.

July 1 is important for the school district. It’s the day charter school contracts begin and also marks the start of the fiscal year. One year ago, the city’s RSD charters all transferred back to the local school district’s oversight. That nearly doubled the size of the district.

Last year, the district was on track to have only one traditional school: McDonogh 35. But it ended up taking over two struggling elementary charter schools and running them directly instead.

In May 2018, Cypress Academy’s former governing nonprofit board abruptly announced that the school would not reopen for the 2018-2019 school year. The district took over the school — which served a large number of special education students — to avoid the sudden closure. Initially, Lewis said the district would manage Cypress for two years, but in November, he announced that Cypress would be closed and its students transferred to Foundation Preparatory after the school year ended.

Another charter, Edgar P. Harney Spirit of Excellence Academy, had myriad financial irregularities and was found to have been providing inadequate special education services. The district forced it to surrender its charter, taking it over in January. Harney also closed after the end of the 2018-2019 school year.

District officials say they are focusing on replicating highly rated schools to create more seats for students. The majority of D and F-rated schools in Orleans Parish during the 2018-19 school year were ones that returned from the Recovery School District. Lewis closed four of them, but only the ones that were up for contract renewal.

Education reform advocates have claimed success as test scores and graduation rates have risen. But other groups remain skeptical, noting exams and the state’s grading formula have changed often and that holding charters accountable appears to be an ongoing challenge for the Orleans Parish school district. In addition, schools no longer have a large district to rely on for costly services. That has driven more money to administration and away from the classroom, according to one study.

In its heavily decentralized system, the school district created a number of new positions last summer to monitor charter schools and started tracking the smallest of legal requirements that affect the public, such as boards that fail to post their board meeting minutes online. The district also began telling families at charter schools when their schools will be up for contract renewals — a make-or-break year that can result in school closures.

The district-created “Charter School Framework that was designed to equip OPSB with the foundational tools to hold schools accountable annually and at the point of renewal,” said a statement, attributed to the Orleans Parish School Board, that the district provided to The Lens on Monday.

Asked about the move to an all-charter city, Nahliah Webber, the executive director of the Orleans Parish Education Network, said she doesn’t expect much to change. OPEN is a nonprofit that advocates for inclusive, transparent, and community-aligned public policy.

“We’ve kind of been operating under the understanding that it was already an all-charter system,” she said.

Advocates like Webber worry about the district’s ability to hold the nearly three dozen independent nonprofit organizations that run the city’s roughly 75 schools accountable. Those concerns are especially heightened in light of the recent grade-fixing scandal at John F. Kennedy High School. The problem, first reported by The Lens in March, led to a review of senior transcripts, uncovering problems that went well beyond grade inflation. A close examination of student records revealed 92 of 177 seniors were not eligible for graduation. Most of the ineligible students didn’t learn that until a month after walking at their commencement ceremony.

“Our biggest concern is that we can’t have reactive accountability,” Webber said, after mentioning Kennedy’s seniors, some of whom are now in summer school. “We can’t wait until half the students of a graduating class are found to be ineligible for graduation before OPSB steps in.”

In response to the findings, Lewis called for the state Inspector General’s Office to open a criminal investigation into Kennedy. He’s also ordered an audit of all high school students’ records citywide. It’s a tall order but one he said was necessary to ensure what happened at Kennedy doesn’t happen again.

Lewis’ office appears to be adding more staff to focus on accountability, according to a district statement issued Monday.

“OPSB is continually assessing how best to strengthen and improve its oversight of schools,” an emailed statement from the board said. “Given that, we have identified the need for additional capacity and expertise on our accountability team along with new on-going oversight tools, like we will implement on our annual site visits this fall for high schools.”

The last traditional school

McDonogh 35, the first public high school for African-Americans in New Orleans, was highly regarded for decades. Its list of alumni includes Ernest “Dutch” Morial, the city’s first black mayor, and former New Orleans Police Department Chief Michael Harrison. But the school’s state standardized test scores have been on the decline for years, which Lewis said was a major part of his decision.

The district tried and failed for years to charter McDonogh 35. When those efforts were unsuccessful, and as the school’s academic performance slumped, it decided to phase out the school and restart it. This year, the high school didn’t have new ninth grade students. But the only contractor who qualified to close out the school had problems of its own. So the district opted to run the school for the 2018-19 school year.

Over the last school year, the district awarded charter group InspireNOLA two contracts related to the school. The first was a contract to see McDonogh 35’s older students through graduation. The second, a charter contract, allows the group to start a ninth grade academy this fall. It will add one grade each year until it’s a full high school.

With the official move to an all-charter model, Webber said she’s concerned the system is “digging in its heels.”

“The model is not bearing out the promises that it made,” she said.

A 2018 report by The Education Research Alliance found that the switch to charter schools resulted in substantial improvements in student achievement, graduation rates and college entry. And polling by the Cowen Institute last year found that 60 percent of respondents said that charter schools have improved education in the city. And 55 percent said that the city’s “open enrollment model,” eliminating geographically based enrollment, has improved public education.

Still, Webber noted that a large number of the city’s schools are rated a D or F.

“You have been unshackled from the school in your neighborhood,” Webber said. “But what does that mean?”

She pointed to schools with poor ratings that are nearly all black or hispanic. Meanwhile, she said white students are often overrepresented at schools with better ratings.

“The ultimate choice is those who can chose out of the system altogether.”

In recent years, the district has taken a more hands-on approach to monitoring charters. Last year, it preemptively halted enrollment at four charters it did not think would be open this coming fall. Indeed they are all closed, a decision made by Lewis.

Webber said she hopes the district will change that enforcement model.

“You can’t close your way to a good school system,” she said.

When the district stepped in at Cypress Academy and forced Harney give up its charter midyear, it took over direct operations. A district statement said that has prepared them for future takeovers.

“Given our work this past year at Cypress Academy and Harney Elementary School, OPSB had gathered first-hand experience of what additional resources, policies, and staffing is needed if and when such a takeover is required,” a statement released by the district said.

Still, Webber thinks the district needs to be more proactive. If it sees a problem at one school, she thinks it should be examining similar schools for the same issue.

“It’s been really hard lately to see how the system is going to be able to sustain itself when we have a reactive accountability structure.”",[]

That means network monitoring. Knowing what's happening on your network is critical to responding to any undesired activity. However, operational technology (OT) network monitoring tools lag far behind traditional IT solutions, which aren't a good fit for industrial control systems.

In addition to network monitoring, Worley wanted the ability to actively query programmable logic controllers (PLCs) at water treatment plants to discover any changes in programming logic — by an employee, a systems integrator, or a malicious third party.

City of Raleigh Steve Worley, City of Raleigh SCADA security manager

Rather than develop a solution in-house, he chose to deploy the Indegy network monitoring tool. ""We were looking to have more robust network monitoring for our network that spans across a large area of the county,"" he tells CSO.

Worley considered developing a solution in-house using open source tools, but concluded that would be too time-consuming. The city published an RFP and considered their options. ""We looked at all the major vendors in the realm of network monitoring of SCADA/ICS networks,"" he tells CSO by email. ""Indegy’s active monitoring of the PLCs and network was a major part of the decision to go with them.""

The project has since won a CS050 award.

ICS monitoring provides greater visibility

After implementing the solution, Worley says he now has dramatically greater real-time visibility into what's happening on his network, a step he says other water works around the country should consider taking. ""People are hesitant because they fear it's going to interfere with the operations or cause a PLC to malfunction,"" he says. ""But there are ways to do network monitoring and even a little bit of active monitoring safely and securely on OT networks.""

Safety has always been a priority when it comes to industrial control systems. Throw security into the mix, and the problem gets more challenging.

Protecting water treatment plants

While Worley is worried about nation-state activity on his network, he's equally concerned about accidents, malfunctions, operator error, malicious insiders — even hurricanes. ""In North Carolina we get some pretty severe weather events every once in a while,"" he tells CSO. ""We need to know when our equipment is up and running and when it's not.""

The solution, Worley says, is network monitoring and timely patching. ""The basics of cybersecurity you still need to do on the OT side,"" he says. ""People are scared to do it sometimes and maybe that's a takeaway.""

""It's complex. It's hard to figure out how to patch your systems. It's hard to figure out how to monitor your systems,"" he adds. ""Just because it's a hard problem doesn't mean you can't move forward and improve your cybersecurity posture.""

Insider threats are also a concern. After the infamous Maroochydore, Queensland, incident in Australia when a disgruntled water works employee dumped millions of liters of raw sewage into local rivers, water treatment facilities have had to manage the risk of a privileged user abusing their trust to do something malicious.

Since the Indegy solution gives the City of Raleigh real-time, granular visibility into not only the network, but all the PLCs as well, Worley feels confident that such an attack would be discovered and stopped. The monitoring tools creates an audit trail of all changes, making it easy to trace back security incidents to their root cause.

As for nation-state adversaries? Worley says he's yet to see evidence of such activity on his network. ""It is something we keep an eye on,"" he says. ""One of the reasons we got this tool is to help monitor that better. The more you know about your network the more you can protect yourself.""",[]

For years, the museum has told the story of the Capital City through rotating exhibits on everything from the Spanish Flu to the growth of the Triangle's Indian community and more. And in April, the museum is celebrating a month of special programs as part of Raleigh History Month to celebrate the city's cultural heritage and encourage the public to explore the city's historic sites.

Those activities include several walking tours, such as a Civil War-themed excursion on April 6, an architecture tour on April 13 and an African American history walking tour on April 20. The walks are probably best for kids ages 12 and up or so. More information about the tours and tickets is on the museum's website.

And on April 5, the museum will open a new exhibit thanks to a collaboration with students at Moore Square Magnet Middle School. ""Our Families’ Treasures"" is an exhibit that focuses on the important objects that students have in their life and tells the story of their families. From stories of war, migration, love, and even a look to the future, according to a press release, the eighth grade students at Moore Square will show you how one object can represent an entire story.

In other words, these are all great reasons to visit the City of Raleigh Museum if you haven't been recently, and there's plenty to keep kids engaged.

The details

The museum is at 220 Fayetteville St., right in the middle of downtown Raleigh. Admission is free though donations of $5 for adults are encouraged. There's also a small gift shop on site.

What you'll see

The museum features several exhibits that explore various of aspects and personalities of Raleigh.

At the entrance to the museum, you'll see Raleigh Then, Raleigh Now, Raleigh Next, which tells the city's story through various artifacts and images with interactive kiosks. On the other side of the room is a display on Raleigh politics (with more screens and buttons for kids to push).

As you move back, you'll pass through exhibits on Civil Rights in Raleigh, the political cartoons of Dwane Powell and the history of Dix Hill, now home to a massive park.

What makes it kid friendly?

At the entrance to the museum's exhibits, kids might enjoy seeing the artifacts or manipulating the various buttons and screens. They'll also find a collection of dress-up clothes, including World War II uniforms, that they can try on.

A hands-on history cart is usually stationed nearby. It features a rotating collection of items that visitors can pick up, touch and check out. When we were there, the cart included a stereoscope, which makes images appear three dimensional; a telegraph machine that we could punch out Morse code on; and an old matchbox holder.

""Honestly, adults love this too,"" said Megan Raby, the museum's assistant director.

And there's more for kids to do as you move toward the back of the museum.

In the exhibit about Powell, the Draw Your Thoughts wall is hot spot for visitors of all ages, who get to actually draw on the wall. Visitors spend a lot of time developing their own versions of Powell's work or creating something entirely their own.

""Who gets to draw on a wall in a museum?"" said Ernest Dollar, the museum's director.

In the Dix Hill exhibit, visitors can share what they hope will be included as Raleigh develops the property into a park (let me just add another vote for ""playground with desserts"" as one child requested) and a sound booth where you can record your own thoughts or memories about the land, which was once home to a psychiatric hospital.

Nodding to the property's prior use, visitors also are encouraged to complete a picture of what they feel like on the inside and what they look like on the outside. It's an especially effective way to help kids better understand mental illness.

If you go to the City of Raleigh Museum

Hours are 9 a.m. to 4 p.m., Tuesday through Saturday, and 1 p.m. to 4 p.m., Sunday. It's also open from 6 p.m to 9 p.m. on the first Friday of each month.

The museum also offers Saturday afternoon walking tours and free yoga sessions, which families are welcome to attend (though they are not designed specifically for kids in mind). Check the website for details.

The city of Louisville issued a warning stating the trail that runs north and south from Warembourg Fishing Pond to the concrete trail is closed pending engineer assessment of subsurface soil erosion.

“This is a very isolated incident at an agricultural stock pond,” said Ember Brignull, open space superintendent for Louisville. “The agricultural stock pond has an outlet structure with a pipe that runs water under a trail to a ditch which then feeds into the Warembourg Fishing Pond. We will be evaluating in the morning at which point the closure may be lifted or remain in effect.”

Brignull assured that the Warembourg incident is not related to the recent landslide along eastbound U.S. 36 and a geological pitfall at the city’s Coyote Run Open Space.

In the Coyote Run situation, the city agreed in May to spend approximately $500,000 to halt a landslide that has slowly threatened nearby homes for the past six years. City council approve a $500,000 contract with Hayward Baker for mitigation work on the roughly 20-foot-deep and growing hole, with a contingency of $50,000. City staff also is proposing leaders approve up to $40,000 for consulting firm, Terracon, for construction management and monitoring after the fact, according to a staff report.

Brignull said city staff noticed the Warembourg issue while monitoring the stock pond.

“Staff observed some erosion occurring around the water outlet structure,” said Brignull.

She said the city’s first priority is the safety of the trail users, so as a precaution officials are closing the trail located above the pipe until the water level lowers and the city can reevaluate the situation.

It wasn’t made clear whether the higher levels of water was due to snow and rain the county has seen this year.",[]

Mayor Greg Fischer's mid-February announcement that he wanted to triple the city's insurance premium tax sparked a whirlwind debate about the state of the city's budget amid rising pension obligations.

With public hearings kicking off and Metro Council votes on the horizon, here's what you need to know to get caught up:

How did Louisville fall into a budget crisis?

Louisville and communities across the state in the County Employees Retirement System were told they needed to pay more for their employees' pension benefits in 2017, after the Kentucky Retirement Systems board made a new set of assumptions.

At the time, the state budget director, John Chilton, called the new assumptions a ""realistic"" outlook for the plans.

It sent shock waves across the state, including in Louisville, where Fischer and his team warned of ""draconian"" and ""crippling"" cuts that would have to be made to cover the estimated $38 million in retirement costs.

But Louisville and other local governments, school districts and municipal agencies in CERS successfully lobbied for a phase-in of the cost. The plan approved by the state legislature caps pension cost increases at 12 percent each year.

Background: Louisville avoids 'crippling' budget cuts from soaring pension costs thanks to override of Bevin's veto

Last year, the city absorbed a roughly $9.4 million increase in pension costs by using some nonrecurring revenue sources and not filling 49 open positions.

This year, it appears things won't be as simple.

What does the budget situation look like in 2019? And in years to come?

Fischer's team has said there's a roughly $35 million hole in the upcoming budget.

About $20 million of that — last year's $9.4 million, plus about $10.4 million this year — is from the rising pension obligations the KRS board put into place.

The other $15 million stems from increasing health care costs and lower-than-expected revenue, according to Daniel Frockt, the city's chief financial officer.

The mayor's office expects that the pension costs will rise by roughly $10 million for each of the next four budget cycles, meaning that the budget hole will grow to $65 million by fiscal year 2023.

What's Mayor Fischer's plan to fix it?

Fischer has laid out two options to handle the shortfall: devastating cuts that would harm the delivery of city services, or tripling the insurance premium tax on policies except for health and vehicle insurance.

He's embarked on a citywide tour of agencies that would be affected by the potential cuts, like Louisville Fire and Louisville Metro Police, making the case that the cuts are not an option for a ""city on the rise."" His preferred alternative is the tax hike.

That proposal, which is being sponsored by five Democrats on the Metro Council, would increase the insurance premium tax from 5 percent to 12.5 percent in the upcoming budget and the next. It would go up again to 13.5 percent in fiscal year 2022 and finally to 15 percent by fiscal year 2023.

Council Democrats: We need mix of budget cuts and Fischer's tax hike

Frockt, Louisville's CFO, estimates it would increase the average Louisville family's home insurance by $12 to $13 per month by the time the tax hike is fully enacted. That's based on a $1,500 premium for a house worth anywhere from $125,000 to $300,000.

Several members of Metro Council, which will ultimately decide whether to approve Fischer's tax hike, have suggested that they want a mix of cuts and new revenue.

Prior to his call for the tax hike, Fischer released a plan for cuts, which includes reductions in public safety that the police chief said would be a ""slow train wreck"" for LMPD.

When does Louisville have to decide?

The city faces a strict deadline to decide on the insurance premium tax hike.

For it to be enacted July 1, the start of the fiscal year, the Metro Council would have to pass the proposed ordinance at their March 21 council meeting, as the state's insurance department requires 100-day notice.

The Fischer administration first shared the tax hike plan on Feb. 13, leaving about five weeks for members to vet the plan or come up with alternatives.

Who supports Louisville's tax hike? Who opposes it?

Many council members are publicly undecided, as they discuss budget cuts they could stomach among themselves.

A Courier Journal survey of the 26-member council shows nine Democrats either supporting or leaning toward supporting the tax hike. An equal number of council members, mostly Republicans, are opposed or leaning against a tax hike.

That leaves seven undecided council members and one — Brent Ackerson — who did not respond to repeated requests for comment. All are Democrats, as is Fischer, giving him what appears to be a party-line advantage.

These positions are subject to change, as negotiations in council continue, but all seven Republicans on council are likely to remain against the measure.

Other opponents include Greater Louisville Inc., the city's chamber of commerce. Kent Oyler, the group's president and CEO, wrote that the insurance premium tax is an ""exceptionally terrible tax"" that would only be made worse under Fischer's plan.

""We should reject the notion that Louisville is left with only two extreme options to pay for pensions,"" Oyler wrote. ""There is a lot of room in the middle.""

What other revenue options did Mayor Fischer consider?

Fischer told reporters he considered about six revenue-generating options, evaluating their feasibility and effectiveness, before landing on the insurance premium tax.

His team ruled out options that required a state law change or a voter referendum to be enacted, as well as some that would be unpopular or raise too little revenue to make a difference.

Here are some he weighed:

A car rental fee of up to 3 percent that city officials said wouldn't raise enough money.

A local franchise fee they say would be an unstable revenue source and wouldn't be levied on suburban cities.

An occupational license fee they feared would be unpopular because it's a tax on ""productivity.""

A restaurant tax that needs state approval.

A taxing district that would be subject to a thumbs up from voters.

""When we went through the conversations with the council, they arrived at the same conclusion that we were at,"" Fischer said earlier this month. ""... When we took a look at the time required and the amount of money required, the consensus was the insurance premium tax.""

There's a late push brewing in the state legislature to get a restaurant tax bill heard in committee and moving before time runs out. Some lobbyists, including Fischer's chief lobbyist, question whether there's time — or appetite among lawmakers — to consider the proposals.

Why is there a budget shortfall if there was just a surplus?

In December, Louisville Metro Council sent roughly a half-million dollars in surplus money to address the homeless crisis, as a ""bridge"" to a permanent solution.

How was there surplus money, if the city now has a shortfall?

Frockt says the budget surplus, which was roughly $600,000, came from fiscal year 2018, which ended on June 30.

That fiscal year, the city hadn't yet been tasked with paying more on their pension bill and also hadn't seen as much of a spike in health care costs. The surplus came from both the revenue and expense side of that year's budget, Frockt said.

Plus, it's worth noting that $600,000 is a relatively small amount, both compared to the overall $750 million budget and the anticipated shortfalls of $35 million to $65 million, Frockt said.

https://www.coloradohometownweekly.com/2019/07/01/plans-submitted-to-develop-long-dormant-conocophillips-property-in-louisville/,['Louisville'],Plans submitted to develop long dormant ConocoPhillips property in Louisville,"More than 10 years ago Louisville believed it was on the cusp of an economic windfall when ConocoPhillips purchased a 388-acre parcel along U.S. 36 near Northwest Parkway and planned to build a state-of-the-art research and training campus that was expected to create 7,000 jobs.

Those plans, however, were rendered defunct in 2012 when ConocoPhillips decided to spin off Phillips 66 as an independent company, and rumors about the property’s future have run wild ever since Phillips 66 put it up for sale. In 2018, there were reports that Amazon was considering the site for its HQ2 Project, but in the end, the property remained undeveloped and its future uncertain — that is until June 24.

Though there had been no reports of the property being sold, on June 24 Brue Baukol Capital Partners, a Denver-based real estate investment and development firm, submitted a proposal to the Louisville Planning and Building Safety Department outlining several amendments to the previously approved ConocoPhillips campus general development plan.

If approved by the Louisville Planning Commission in September, it would allow for the creation of a new, mixed-use neighborhood featuring a 500,000-square-foot campus designed for a corporate headquarters — which reportedly already has an interested tenant — as well as a 1,500-unit senior living facility, and more than 3.4 million square feet designated for office, retail and hotel space.

The master plan amendments retain 22% of the overall site as parks and open space.

Known as the P66 project, total build-out is expected to take up to 12 years.

“Brue Baukol Capital Partners aims to create a master planned, mixed-use community that both activates another node of the community while paying tribute to its historical openness,” Brue Baukol’s Vice President Jordan Swisher wrote in a letter to the planning department. “We are confident economic evaluation and reports will demonstrate the net positive fiscal effect to the city of Louisville as well as the overall area.”

Swisher did not respond to a request for comment, so it is unclear whether Phillips 66 sold the property to Brue Baukol Capital Partners. The document submitted to the city refers to Phillips 66 as the developer and Brue Baukol Capital Partners as the designer.",[]

Providing trees to the public, training the community on implicit bias and creating a revised financial literacy curriculum for youths are all part of Louisville's first citywide Resilience Strategy, which was released Monday.

The Rockefeller Foundation selected Louisville in 2016 to be part of the initiative, which helps the city to develop strategies to survive future challenges. ""Resilience"" refers to the ability to survive or bounce back from disaster, a spokesman for the 100 Cities group previously said.

Mayor Greg Fischer said at a press conference Monday that resilience is essential in embracing future obstacles, such as climate change.

""We know we’re going to face these tough challenges, so we’ve got to be prepared,"" Fischer said.

In the 194-page report, the Louisville Metro Government outlined the work it has done since being selected for the 100 Resilient Cities initiative.

Before creating a strategy, the report states that metro government held an agenda-setting workshop with more than 200 people to discuss the topic of resilience and what it meant to Louisville. The core group identified compassion, trauma, equity, sustainability and economic opportunity as the core issues for Louisville's resilience.

Eric Friedlander, the city’s first chief resilience officer, said that compassion, equity and trust serve as the guiding ""North Star"" for building resilience in Louisville.

""Everything in this plan needs to move us in that direction,"" Friedlander said.

To work toward addressing issues identified by the community, the report states four different visions: embracing lifelong learning, ensuring a safe and healthy city, building a vibrant economy and place and maximizing innovation and civic engagement.

Each vision has various goals, and each goal has accompanying action items. For example, a goal under building a vibrant economy is increasing individual financial stability and opportunity for economic mobility, and an action item under that goal is to improve cost-of-living adjusted wages.

Friedlander said the plan will be updated in the future.

Soon, Louisville might be without the resources from 100 Resilient Cities. The organization announced in April that it is transforming and redistributing resources. Friedlander previously said said that 100 Resilient Cities told him it's committed to fully funding the rest of the resilience work, which is expected to run out in late July. The city is in its second year of a two-year cycle with the group.

Louisville Metro Council members avoided some controversial cuts as they passed the city budget on Tuesday night, but that doesn't mean their spending plan will be painless.

To cover funding of the Middletown library, opening two pools next summer and keeping weekly yard waste and recycling collection, among other shifts, the Louisville Metro Council's budget makes changes that could have lasting effects on the city's most poor, most marginalized communities and on public safety.

""Some we'll feel immediately, some we'll feel a few years down the line,"" Councilman Markus Winkler, D-17th District, said of the cuts.

""When you're not intervening in mental health, or in drug rehabilitation services, or in violence interruption, those are things that we will feel,"" said Winkler, who was a co-sponsor of a tax hike ordinance that could've allowed the city to avoid some of the cuts.

The budget ordinance passed 24-1 Tuesday night with many changes from Mayor Greg Fischer's original budget proposal. Fischer has said he will not veto the plan because the city needs the ""certainty"" of a budget, but still raised concerns.

""The numbers balance,"" he told the Courier Journal on Thursday, ""but the next question is what the human cost is.""

Councilwoman Madonna Flood, D-24th District, was the sole vote against the budget. She said the citizens of Louisville deserved better, referencing the tax hike that she supported.

""I, in good conscience, cannot vote for something that puts the most vulnerable people in crisis situations,"" Flood said, to applause from people in the audience.

Councilman James Peden, R-23rd District, was not present for the vote.

See the list: Louisville Metro Council finalizes proposed budget and make cuts

The revised plan strips money from the Living Room, a diversion program to help people with mental illnesses or substance abuse problems, as well as much of the money Louisville has typically sent to nonprofits and the city's Cure Violence ""interrupter"" program, meant to curb violence by treating it like a disease.

Additionally, public safety is still getting hit, despite some council members' statements that the budget could be cut without hurting operations like police, fire and EMS.

The city is expected to lose a firehouse on Grade Lane by the airport that the union doubts will ever reopen and an ambulance from Louisville Metro EMS. The city also will likely see a net decrease in police officers on the street this time next year, thanks to a canceled recruit class and anticipated officer departures.

And, importantly, the council's budget shifts operation of the city's youth detention center from Louisville Metro to the state, even though the state has said it cannot operate a detention center near Jefferson County.

That means Louisville youths facing charges, who are predominantly black, will likely be shipped to one of six other detention centers across the state, some of which are more than 100 miles away.

Sending those juveniles outside the county – and away from their support systems –probably won't be a recipe for positive change, said Councilwoman Nicole George, D-21st District, who also voted for the tax hike and is a former social worker.

With children, positive behavior changes happen when ""we're able to capitalize on assets — and not pluck a kid up from their home and home life and move them out to another place and hope for the best,"" she said.

Council members also stripped money from the ""interrupter"" program, to eliminate the three sites run by No More Red Dots and the YMCA, which came under scrutiny in recent months.

Previously: Violence 'interrupters' in spotlight as city pauses payments, hospital cuts ties

City officials including police Chief Steve Conrad had praised the model, which in Louisville was trained on hot spot neighborhoods including Russell, Shawnee and Portland, as a proactive way of stopping crime.

Rashaad Abdur-Rahman, the city official charged with overseeing the office that managed Cure Violence, wrote in a recent opinion piece that the ""interrupter"" intervention and prevention model is ""necessary to create the safe and healthy communities that we all deserve.""

Asked if the council's revised budget was equitable, Councilman Bill Hollander, a 9th District Democrat who also is the budget chairman, said: ""I think we had to make difficult choices.""

Fischer: Budget changes 'may deepen inequities'

Though Fischer indicated he wouldn't veto the budget ordinance, he did air some concerns with the Metro Council's changes in a statement after Tuesday night's vote.

For one, he said council members kept library hours the same by closing Youth Detention Services, ""before we can work out a solution with the state to keep our most vulnerable youth near their families and their schools.""

Moving operations to the state was an option in Fischer's original list of cuts in February as he campaigned for a tax hike. But he dropped it from his April budget proposal, largely because of ""concerns about the impact on children and equity challenges,"" a spokeswoman said.

""Nobody wants to be in the youth detention center. But the question is, if they are, how important is it for them to keep the connection to their families, their schools together?"" Fischer said in an interview Wednesday. ""The city decided a long time ago that's important.""

Saying he wants ""what's best for the kids and best for the families,"" Fischer said his team had been in talks with the state about transferring responsibility but wanted more time. His budget expected talks to continue through the end of the fiscal year in June 2020.

'Recipe for disaster': Louisville nonprofits see city funding slashed in tight budget

Fischer also noted Tuesday night after the budget vote that the council funded the Middletown library and increased their own discretionary funds in part by making ""deep cuts"" to violence prevention efforts and by cutting offices that work to create economic development and to make government more efficient.

Fischer has said equity was a major factor in his budget proposal, which cut zero community centers, kept most Neighborhood Places running and proposed closing libraries near other branches.

""They were just moving small amounts of money here at the end,"" Fischer said Wednesday. ""When you put money in suburban street sweeping, suburban fire or Middletown library, you took it away from Safe & Healthy Neighborhoods. It made a difficult situation even worse.""

Youth detention center concerns

Hollander, the budget chair, said he's very concerned about the impact moving youth detention operations to the state will have on children, their parents, their grandparents and the community.

""On the other hand, it's a very, very expensive program run by the state in every other community in Kentucky,"" he said. ""And we are forced to pass a balanced budget with rapidly increasing pension costs.""

It's true that Jefferson is the sole county in the state to operate its own youth detention center and that reimbursement payments from the state don't come close to covering the full cost.

But George, speaking to the Courier Journal last week, said there are things that make Jefferson County unique, adding that she's concerned about the effect of moving kids from their support systems, from cultural sensitivity and from educational and behavioral health service continuity.

Previously: Does Fischer want to raise Louisville property taxes? Here's what his budget says

George also questioned whether the city would end up paying a price later for not helping juveniles while they're children, when they're the most capable of change.

""Do we want to make those investments on the front end of life, or do we want to wait and try with adult jail?"" she said. ""If we don't ensure the youth have the best services now, are they going to cost us as adults down the road, in the way of detention?""

""The real question to ask is ... where do we want to make our investments?""

That's a sentiment shared by Winkler, who used the example of nonprofits not getting city funding and being squeezed by Metro United Way, as well.

""What happens to the at-risk youth who we're not intervening in today? Those at-risk 11-year-olds, 12-year-olds, 13-year-olds? When they're older, and they don't have positive change come into their life through some of these organizations?""

The price of police, fire station losses

After rejecting Fischer's proposed insurance premium tax hike, several council members were vocal proponents of the idea that savings could be found in the budget without taking away from critical public safety efforts.

And while the council budget changes do send some additional money toward suburban fire and Louisville police, the goal of preserving all public safety dollars did not pan out.

""I personally didn't get everything I wanted in public safety, particularly with LMPD,"" said Councilman Anthony Piagentini, R-19th District. ""... This time next year, we will have less officers. And I do think that's a problem.""

Piagentini, who voted against the tax hike, said he plans to devote attention to the issue moving forward.

The council did send $50,000 to a recruit allowance fund, but Nicolai Jilek, the president of the union representing Louisville police officers, said Tuesday that anything shy of a ""significant investment to ensure the long-term ability of the city to provide adequate public safety, in my view, will be a failure.""

Kentucky Derby guests: Louisville's budget crisis hasn't curbed Fischer's Derby guest spending. Should it?

Losing police officers, as the department likely would under this budget, is an effect that will continue to impact the city for months and years to come, he said.

Firefighters, too, have made their displeasure with the budget known.

""Will the loss of this fire station mean greater risk to the community? Of course,"" union president Brian O'Neill wrote in a letter to Metro Council members. ""Will the loss of this fire station equate to higher insurance rates, equaling or even surpassing the tax increase that Metro Council voted down? Absolutely.""

And, despite public scrutiny and questions around the program, supporters say ending the ""interrupter"" program could be a lasting detriment as well.

Abdur-Rahman did not respond to Courier Journal requests for comment, but wrote in an opinion piece that the last year of the program, which was a pilot year, led to a decrease in homicides and shootings in the focus areas of the Cure Violence program.

""Let's reject the racist fearmongering about 'paying criminals' and continue to realistically invest in a public health strategy that implements proven initiatives,"" he wrote before the budget vote.

These cuts are ""to the muscle of the city,"" not just waste or fluff, Fischer said.

Council members were not able to find spare money in the budget entirely without pain to the city, he said, so he hopes that they and residents understand Louisville needs investment.

""Hopefully the council, as we've gone through this budget process, understands the importance of investing for the future,"" Fischer said, ""and we'll get back on track here in these next several budgets.""

Craig Alter with Commonwealth Development Corp. of America confirmed to The Oklahoman the company has a contract to buy the block between NW 10, Park Place, Western Avenue and Classen Boulevard, with plans to clear remaining structures to build five stories of housing including underground parking. The development, Thrive on 10th, is set to consist of 176 independent living apartments and 142 assisted living residences.

Alter said the development will be completed in conjunction with the Oklahoma City Housing Authority and will replace the Tower Apartments, older affordable housing located in Midtown.

“We were looking for an area downtown that can support senior housing,” Alter said. “We looked at existing buildings to land areas. We’re finally able to get this property under contract. We sought to work with the Oklahoma City Housing Authority and found an opportunity to work together to build housing that will be replacement for the 138 Tower apartments.”",[]

The original 4½-mile Crosstown Expressway, opened in 1966, was an elevated structure between its junction with Interstate 35 and Western Avenue. Designed without redundant safety systems and with traffic volumes exceeding capacity, the need to replace the highway was without debate when state engineers started looking at the structure's future.

https://www.govtech.com/analytics/State-Partners-to-Tackle-Oklahoma-City-Tree-Count-with-Tech.html,['Oklahoma City'],"State, Partners to Tackle Oklahoma City Tree Count with Tech","(TNS) —Trees matter.

And data that analyzes how many there are, where they are located and how they affect areas where we live, work and play matters too.

It is especially important to Oklahoma’s Department of Agriculture, Food and Forestry, the Association of Central Oklahoma Governments and the Oklahoma City Community Foundation.

The state agency is working with the two other organizations and the Davey Tree Expert Co. to assemble a tree canopy survey that covers 536 square miles, taking in urbanized areas of the greater Oklahoma City metro area.

Representatives of the state agency and community foundation said recently the ongoing survey, which should conclude by July, is the most comprehensive look at how many trees exist in areas that stretch from north Edmond to Norman and from east of Tinker Air Force Base to Yukon.

Mark Bays, urban forestry coordinator at the Oklahoma Forestry Services Division, and Brian Dougherty, director of parks and public spaces at the community foundation, noted recent technological advances helped make the survey possible.

The $150,000 project is being accomplished through financial and in-kind contributions by the community foundation, ACOG and the state agency.

Davey Tree was contracted by the organizations to gather detailed ground-level surveys data. Recently, foresters and arborists from the firm completed a survey of some 19,600 trees located in Oklahoma City parks.

Dougherty said his organization and others have hoped for a truly comprehensive survey of tree cover for a long time.

“I don’t think we could have even attempted something like this just 10 years ago,” he said.

Bays said the ongoing survey is the largest of its kind in Oklahoma, so far.

It uses data collected from various sources.

Researchers first use satellite images to calculate coverage percentages for not just trees, but also buildings, roadways, parking lots, water and undeveloped areas.

They also are importing LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data that has been gathered by ACOG into the study.

Then, on 300 randomly selected tenth-acre plots spread geographically across the study area, Davey Tree professionals are conducting on-the-ground evaluations, where they collect information that identifies what kinds of trees are there, as well as their heights, trunk and crown diameters and health conditions.

Some plots don’t have many trees, while others might have as many as 100.

“They are trying to measure the green space, because at the very end of this, we will be able to calculate the environmental services that the trees are providing,” Bays said.

Trees provide those services by trapping particulate matter in the air, which improves air quality, and by affecting storm water runoff rates. They also provide other environmental benefits, such as shade that reduces summer cooling costs and provides people relief from the sun.

“Using an algorithm, they actually will be able to come up with a dollar amount of what those benefits are and what the value is for human health,” Bays said.

Dougherty said that is valuable information that ACOG, his organization, state officials and other professionals can use.

Plus, he and Bays noted the data also will help each involved entity plan for the future.

“We will be able to use what we learned through the study to help plan future tree plantings for parks, school campuses and trails,” Dougherty said, adding it also will provide valuable information to urban planners concerned about storm water issues and health care professionals.

“There are going to be a lot of different people looking at the information, for different reasons.""

https://www.jns.org/oklahoma-city-reels-from-anti-semitic-white-nationalist-graffiti-attacks/,['Oklahoma City'],"Oklahoma City reels from anti-Semitic, white-nationalist graffiti attacks","Over the last week, swastikas, anti-Semitic, anti-LGBT, racist white-nationalist symbols and epithets defaced five public places in Oklahoma City and Norman, starting at the state’s Oklahoma City-based Democratic Party headquarters. Similar incidences of graffiti were found at the headquarters of the Chickasaw Nation (a federally recognized Native American nation), the Cleveland County Democratic Party headquarters in Norman, a public elementary school and a nonprofit art center.

“Gas the Jews” and “White planet only” were written in black in front of the state’s Democratic headquarters. Swastikas were painted in blue on the glass doors to the building and on the sidewalk in front. The white-nationalist/neo-Nazi symbol “1488,” as well as anti-black and gay slurs, was found in bright-blue spray paint at many of the locations, including at McKinley Elementary School. At the Firehouse Art Center, a bust sculpture was defaced with the word “Jewess.” Two swastikas were painted over the bust’s eyes, and the forehead was marked with red paint running down, as if it had been shot in the head. A message in the art center’s parking lot also expressed hate for German Chancellor Angela Merkel. The Chickasaw Nation’s building was victim to messages like “Indians will be gassed” and “lampshaded.”

A note referred to as a “manifesto” was found at the door of the state Democratic Party headquarters by a city councilwoman; it was turned it over to the police as evidence and not made public. The police have been investigating the incidents as hate crimes, and released a photo and video of a female suspect holding a can of spray paint who appeared to be walking away from one of the attacks. An image of her getting into a gray sedan in another location was also captured. The police asked the public for help in identifying the suspect.

Roberta Clark, executive director of the Jewish Federation of Greater Oklahoma City, told JNS that the federation had made public statements about the graffiti on its Facebook page, noting that the organization was “deeply saddened, again, to learn of anti-Semitic and racist vandalisms in Norman,” after making earlier statements condemning the graffiti in Oklahoma City.

“Hateful rhetoric has no place in our community or country. When individuals or groups are targeted because of their immutable characteristics, the impact of those words and actions are felt by entire communities,” wrote Clark.

“We are grateful to our law-enforcement community for taking each of these incidents seriously. We hope the perpetrator/s of these hateful actions will be found and brought to justice soon,” she told JNS via email.

The Chabad of Oklahoma City’s Rabbi Ovadia Goldman told JNS that he was hesitant to make a public statement regarding the crimes because the perpetrator had not yet been caught, but he was willing to comment on the character of his hometown he’s gleaned in the last two decades. “From the elected officials to the police community to the general community, there has been nothing but love. My experience of 20 years in this community has been nothing but a loving, unified community. They love the Jewish community, they love Israel; we have never seen anything like this before,” he said.

Imam Imad Enchassi, senior imam at the Islamic Society of Greater Oklahoma City, brought his power washer last week to the Democratic headquarters to clean up the anti-Semitic messages. He was also in Norman to help on April 3, telling local television reporters that the writing was clearly the work of the same hand. “I know what hate feels like and this is hate,” Enchassi told Fox25 News.

Politicians Respond

Local and statewide politicians universally condemned the graffiti and its xenophobic messages. “One bigot with a can of spray paint or even a group of bigots do not speak for the hundreds of thousands in this city who stand strongly together against hate and bigotry,” wrote Mayor of Oklahoma City David Holt on his Facebook page.

Congressman Tom Cole, a Republican congressman from Norman serving his ninth term, released a statement saying that he was “incredibly disheartened” with the “cowardly and hateful” defacement. “Such despicable and hate-filled language and symbols have no place in our communities, and I am especially horrified that one of these cases was present at an elementary school,” he said. “No one, especially young and innocent children, should have to encounter such hate.”

Democratic State Rep. Jacob Rosecrants spoke to JNS about growing up in Norman, Okla., as a Roman Catholic. “For the most part, Norman is a university community, very inclusive. Like in other parts of the Midwest, it’s very Caucasian—my district is 80 percent Caucasian. Maybe there’s an underlying racism in more rural areas, a fear of outsiders or immigrants because people are afraid for their jobs, but it’s never gotten loud like this in urban or suburban areas. I’ve never seen anything like this in Norman. Anti-Semitism was literally never here before. I’ve never seen it,” he said.

“They’ve tried to look very anti-Semitic, but it’s also anti-immigrant. For whatever reason, hatred has really come out into the open since the election in 2016,” added Rosecrants, who noted that he feels the hate is targeting institutions seen as Democratic. “As the country has voted more Democratic, Oklahoma has only gotten more Republican, and it will continue to do so as areas that have been traditionally Democratic strongholds move more to the right, I think, in response to national politics.”

Freshman Congresswoman Kendra Horn, who turned a red seat blue in Oklahoma City this past November, released a second public statement of concern, noting that the Norman vandalism seemed to indicate a recurring problem. “I’m heartbroken and troubled to see another display of hate and white supremacy in our state,” Horn said in the statement. “Law enforcement is still investigating, but regardless of intent, subjecting Oklahomans, especially children, to these images is deeply damaging. This behavior empowers those who hold hate-filled beliefs.”

Republican organizers also turned out to clean up the graffiti and made public statements condemning it. Oklahoma Republican Party chairman Pam Pollard tearfully shared thoughts with local media after viewing each racial slur written on the state Democratic Party’s parking lot and building. “The Republican Party openly condemns, repudiates and thinks this is disgusting behavior. Disgusting, what is here, and it should never happen again,” he said. “It doesn’t matter what races they’re condemning; we are Americans and we stand for unification as Americans.”

Victoria Lupia, a member of the Oklahoma City’s Jewish community, has lived in Oklahoma for more than 15 years, and explained that it has a Chabad House, as well as Conservative and Reform synagogues, as well as an active Hillel on campus at Norman’s University of Oklahoma. The university houses the Schusterman Center for Judaic and Israel Studies, where students can major or minor in the subject.

“These graffiti events seem to be the action of single angry individual, Lupia told JNS. “Everyone is disgusted and disturbed by it, but overwhelmingly, everyone is disappointed that such an ugly thing would be perpetrated in our quiet backyard.”",[]

The contrasts raise questions about how the areas, called “opportunity zones,” were selected and whether the tax breaks will attract investments that mostly benefit extremely poor areas or ones where investments were already going.

A review of an Oklahoma map with the zones brings home the point:

Oklahoma City opportunity zones cover much of Midtown and most of downtown. They take in the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center complex but miss some of the low-income, predominantly black neighborhoods adjacent to it. The northeast-side zones include the Northeast 23rd Street corridor, which the city has long targeted for increased investment, Martin Luther King Avenue and the I-35 corridor. A zone does include a troubled industrial and low-income stretch on the west side between I-35 and 10th Street.

Another zone abuts high-income Nichols Hills and includes the Chesapeake Energy campus, although it also extends into industrial and residential areas off Lincoln Boulevard. Little of the south side of Oklahoma City is included, except the former Crossroads Mall area. (Santa Fe South charter school occupies the former mall.) The Capitol Hill area is ignored.

Oklahoma has 117 Opportunity Zones, which are comprised of individual Census tracts. The zones cover rural and urban areas and align in many places with tribal land.

In Tulsa, chunks of the historically black north side were left out, although the downtown zone and Tulsa International Airport areas include some surrounding neighborhoods. Tulsa’s other zones include the industrial west side of the Arkansas River, Sand Springs, the University of Tulsa area and a single tract around Broken Arrow’s entertainment and shopping “Rose District.”

Google’s data center, which is being expanded again, is in an opportunity zone in the MidAmerica Industrial Park south of Pryor. It’s the only zone in Mayes County, which has five other low-income census tracts that didn’t make the state’s cut. Most of McCurtain County, in far southeastern Oklahoma, is an opportunity zone. That area has long struggled with poverty, but also encompasses holdings of timber giant Weyerhaeuser.

Thirty Oklahoma counties do not have any opportunity zones. Oklahoma and Tulsa counties each have 21.

What They Are

Opportunity zones, which were part of a package of tax cuts Congress passed in late 2017, allow investors to reduce or eliminate federal capital gains taxes.

The investors can be individuals, companies or funds set up specifically to invest in the zones. There are no caps on the incentive, although investment must go into low-income census tracts selected by governors in each state. The law allowed states to designate up to one-fourth of their low-income census tracts as opportunity zones. For Oklahoma, that means 117 of the state’s 465 eligible low-income tracts. Nationwide, 8,764 zones were designated as opportunity zones.

Map of Oklahoma Opportunity Zones

State and city leaders are touting the opportunity zones in meetings and online. Investment seminars are being organized on the coasts to attract high-net-worth individuals. Officials say the program is a prime opportunity to accelerate investment that benefits both specific areas and broader surrounding ones. One analysis shows $6.1 trillion in unrealized capital gains are on the books of corporations and individuals.

“Even a small fraction of these gains reinvested into opportunity zones would constitute the largest economic development initiative in the country,” John Lettieri, co-founder of the Economic Innovation Group, told Congress in a hearing last year.

Others are skeptical. They question whether the program will live up to its purpose, saying the investments could increase gentrification in urban areas and displace poorer residents. They also worry much of the money will go INTO big-ticket urban real estate deals that already made financial sense.

“The fundamental problem with opportunity zones is the disconnect between the size of the potential tax costs, which are uncapped, and the social benefits from the investments, which will be hard to measure,” said Steven M. Rosenthal, a senior fellow in the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute.

Oklahoma City has 21 Opportunity Zones. They are comprised of individual Census tracts. The city’s zones include much of the thriving downtown area, as well as the OU Health Sciences Center complex and the Chesapeake Energy campus.

Downtown Oklahoma City has seen hundreds of millions in public and private investment in the past several decades. In the seven tracts that make up much of downtown, the Census Bureau estimates their total population at just 3,800 people, although hundreds of new apartments have been built in the past several years. The tract covering Chesapeake has roughly 2,300 residents.

To designate the low-income tracts, the federal tax law said states must use five-year population estimates from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey for 2011-2015.

The only businesses that don’t qualify to participate are gambling establishments, country clubs, golf courses, massage parlors and liquor/beer stores. Theoretically, an energy company could invest in oil and gas or renewable energy projects located in an opportunity zone. Investors or companies also could target specific industries, like aerospace, or community needs like affordable housing.

How They Were Chosen

The zones were announced with little fanfare and no insight into the criteria used to select them. The tax law gave states’ governors complete autonomy, as long as they met certain income or poverty requirements. Oklahoma had 90 days to select the opportunity zone tracts last year. Through the Oklahoma Department of Commerce, Fallin’s office consulted with chambers of commerce, tribal leaders and economic development officials to make the designations, said Leslie Blair, a spokeswoman for the Commerce Department.

At least 34 states had some type of public input on the designations of opportunity zones, according to the Economic Innovation Group, which helped develop the policy and is monitoring its implementation. Both California and Colorado published draft maps of zones, which were then refined with public input. Oklahoma did not hold any public meetings because they weren’t required, Blair said.

In addition, governors were allowed to designate a small number of tracts next to low-income tracts. But those tracts must have median family incomes that don’t exceed 125 percent of the median in the adjacent low-income tracts. No more than 5 percent of a state’s opportunity zones can have that contiguous designation.

Gov. Kevin Stitt, Oklahoma City Mayor David Holt and Tulsa Mayor G.T. Bynum have all touted the potential of opportunity zones to attract new investment to the state.

“It’s going to be a tremendous opportunity for Oklahoma to recruit businesses to our state,” Stitt said at a Jan. 17 press conference. He designated Lt. Gov. Matt Pinnell as his administration’s point man on development of the zones. Pinnell plans a series of summits in the coming months to promote the zones in rural areas.

David Holt, who took office in April, said the zones were designated before he took office and the state led much of the process. Overall, he’s happy with the 21 zones in Oklahoma City, although he wishes the Capitol Hill area in southwest Oklahoma City had been included.

“The opportunity zones downtown and in the Innovation District (east of downtown) are obviously low-hanging fruit and probably sell themselves to some extent, but we would really feel disappointed in the end if we weren’t able to leverage them to get more investment in Northeast 23rd or Crossroads Mall or Northwest 10th, some of those more challenged areas that are also a part of the opportunity zones,” Holt said

Marketing the Zones

With the zones designated, state and city officials are in marketing mode. Oklahoma City is partnering with a nonprofit, Accelerator for America, to come up with a prospectus for investors. The city’s opportunity-zone effort is coordinated by the Alliance for Economic Development, which contracts with the city for economic development.

“We took a look at all of the eligible tracts and then from there tried to figure out the areas of this city where there was a planned public investment for now or in the near future that could potentially spur additional private investment,” said Kian Kamas, Tulsa’s chief of economic development.

For example, Tulsa picked census tracts along a new bus rapid transit route that extends to North Tulsa with a plan to attract a major employer to the area. The View is one of the city’s first housing developments to take advantage of the incentive and has designated 20 percent of its units for affordable housing, Kamas said.

“They’re still very much distressed areas where there’s a lot of work to do, but we knew that we already had strategies in place that would allow the city to make public investments or where we knew there were already planned philanthropic investments that could really help encourage and maybe reduce the risk or perceived risk of a private investor,” Kamas said.

The Commerce Department is contacting city and counties with opportunity zones to see what kind of investments could be marketed to investors, said Jon Chiappe, director of research and economic analysis. It also plans to reach out to qualified opportunity funds, which allow investors to pool their money in funds that invest in the zones.

“If we can highlight some of these opportunities to investors outside the state, then we can potentially attract capital to this state for development,” Chiappe said. “In Duncan, it might be an industrial park. In Bartlesville, it might be affordable housing and whatever’s important to that community.”

The agency is also trying to track investments to see if the opportunity zone designation had a positive effect on poverty and employment. The incentive is more beneficial the longer an investor has money in a project or fund, so gathering that data will take time. In a joint letter to the IRS, Oklahoma and 11 other states urged federal officials to require opportunity funds to report where they’ve invested in opportunity zones, the amount of capital deployed and the appreciation of that capital.

Currently, there is no public reporting requirement.

https://patch.com/new-york/new-york-city/nyc-among-smoggiest-cities-nation-report-says,['New York'],"NYC Is Among Smoggiest Cities In Nation, Report Says","NEW YORK – New Yorkers are breathing some pretty grimy air, according to a report which is likely not going to shock too many city dwellers. Every borough except for Brooklyn recorded a grade F from researchers from the American Lung Association for smog levels.

And before Brooklynites throw open their windows to celebrate with lungs full of fresh air, they only escaped getting an F because no monitoring data was available.

The association found that more than 40 percent of Americans live in areas with unhealthy air. New York ranked tenth worst in the country for smog levels.

There was some good news: when researchers looked at particle pollution, which comes from sources including wildfires, wood-burning devices, coal plants and diesel engines — New York City's air was clean. Every county got a grade A.

But the poor marks came for ozone pollution, or smog. Ozone is produced when pollutants react to sunlight. ""Increased heat in 2017 likely drove this increase in ozone,"" the report said.

""Warmer temperatures stimulate the reactions in the atmosphere that cause ozone to form, and 2017 saw the second warmest temperatures on record in the United States,"" the report says. ""All three years covered in this report rank as the three warmest years ever recorded.""

Harold Wimmer, the group's president and CEO, said that after years of progress, there's clear evidence of a ""disturbing trend,"" with many Americans seeing their air quality worsening due to wildfires and weather patterns. Climate change is fueling that trend, he said.

""This increase in unhealthy air is eye-opening, and points to the reality that the nation must do more to protect the public from serious, even life-threatening harm,"" Wimmer said in a news release. ""There is no clearer sign that we are facing new challenges than air pollution levels that have broken records tracked for the past twenty years, and the fact that we had more days than ever before when monitored air quality reached hazardous levels for anyone to breathe.""

The American Lung Association, whose work involves improving lung health and preventing lung disease, looked at ozone and particle pollution, often called soot, in its 20th annual ""State of the Air"" report. Nationwide, more than 141 million people lived in areas last year with unsafe levels of the two, the report found. That's an increase of more than 7 million from 2017.

The report said each county had several Orange days, which means the air quality was bad enough to be deemed unhealthy to people with sensitive health conditions.

The report looked at three years of data on the two most widespread outdoor air pollutants from 2015-17, which were the warmest years in recorded history.

For the study, researchers with the Lung Association measured particle pollution in both short- and long-term intervals. Short-term refers to daily spikes that can prove deadly, while long-term refers to yearly average.

California, which has been devastated by wildfires in recent years, is home to four of the 10 cities most polluted by short-term particle pollution, and six of the 10 most polluted year-round. Furthermore, the Golden State is home to seven of the 10 most ozone-polluted cities.

Ozone pollution, often called smog, is unhealthy and essentially leaves a sunburn on the lungs, the report said. Breathing in ozone can leave people suffering from shortness of breath and cause bouts of coughing, asthma attacks and even early death.

Los Angeles remained the city with the worst ozone for the 19th time in the report's 20-year history. Here are the 10 places most polluted by ozone:

Los Angeles-Long Beach, CA Visalia, CA Bakersfield, CA Fresno-Madera-Hanford, CA Sacramento-Roseville, CA San Diego-Chula Vista-Carlsbad, CA Phoenix-Mesa, AZ San Jose-San Francisco-Oakland, CA Houston-The Woodlands, TX New York-Newark, NY–NJ-CT-PA

It’s not exactly an unexpected result; LA has topped the list in 19 of the 20 years since the association began releasing the annual report.

More alarming is that Los Angeles’s air quality got worse since last year’s report.

The analysis draws data from three years (2015 to 2017), gathering average ozone levels from that time period. In that period, LA County averaged 119 days per year during which ozone, or smog, was at unhealthy levels. In last year’s report, the county averaged 111 unhealthy days.

Air quality was actually worse in San Bernardino and Riverside counties, which are lumped in with Los Angeles for the study’s city rankings. Those counties averaged 161 and 130 ozone days, respectively.

The negative effects of smog go beyond obscuring views from the Griffith Observatory. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, ozone can cause permanent lung damage, make asthma attacks more likely, and can even heighten the risk of early death for those exposed to high levels.

The LA area fared slightly better when it came to particle pollution, which can be aggravated by a range of sources—from diesel engines to vacuum cleaners. In terms of short-term particle pollution, when the level of harmful particulate matter in the air spikes for a brief time period, Los Angeles ranked seventh among cities affected by these temporary hazards.

Longer term levels of particle pollution in Los Angeles were high enough to place the city fifth on that list. It was one of six urban areas in California to rank among the top ten.

Particle pollution, which can trigger heart attacks, strokes, and asthma attacks, can be especially exacerbated by wildfires, which have plagued California in recent years.

In the Los Angeles area, fires caused air quality levels in some parts of the region to twice hit “maroon,” the most severe level on the EPA’s Air Quality Index. Smoke from the massive Thomas Fire likely contributed to a major deterioration in air quality around Santa Barbara during the period analyzed in the report.

The region went from one of the cleanest urban areas in last year’s report to the 17th-most polluted this time around.

Since this year’s report doesn’t include data from 2018, it’s likely that California will fare poorly again in next year’s analysis. Major fires throughout the state triggered air quality warnings in the Bay Area and Southern California.",['Subsistence - Physiology']
https://news.wttw.com/2019/04/24/chicago-among-country-s-most-polluted-cities-study-finds,['Chicago'],"Chicago Among the Country’s Most Polluted Cities, Study Finds","A new report shows that Chicago has experienced an increase in days with spikes of ozone-polluted air, which can be especially harmful to children, older adults and those with asthma or lung diseases.

Thanks to our sponsors: View all sponsors

The American Lung Association’s 2019 “State of the Air” report found that the city had a yearly average of 14 “unhealthy ozone days” from 2015-17, which represents the most recent comprehensive set of data on ozone pollution throughout the country. In last year’s report, Chicago was shown to have an annual average of about 10 unhealthy ozone days.

Based on the increase, the ALA now classifies Chicago as the 18th most polluted city in the U.S., up from 22nd last year and 26th the year prior.

“Chicago residents should be aware that we’re breathing unhealthy air, largely caused by hotter days and vehicle emissions, placing our health and lives at risk,” said Angela Tin, national senior director for clean air initiatives for the ALA, in a statement.

The annual report by the Chicago-based organization tracks Americans’ exposure to dangerous levels of the two most widespread outdoor air pollutants: ozone pollution, also known as smog; and particle pollution, also called soot. Both types of pollution can increase the risk of premature death and other health effects such as lung cancer, asthma attacks, cardiovascular damage and developmental and reproductive harm, according to the report.

In terms of ozone pollution, the report measures ground-level ozone, which is created by chemical reactions from pollutants emitted by sources such as cars, power plants, boilers and refineries.

“When older adults or children with asthma breathe ozone-polluted air, too often they end up in the doctor’s office, the hospital or the emergency room,” Tin said in a statement. “Ozone can even shorten life itself.”

The report shows how warmer temperatures influenced by climate change make ozone more likely to form and harder to clean up.

Despite the jump in unhealthy ozone days in Chicago and other cities, ozone pollution has decreased nationwide over the past decade in large part due to reductions in major sources of emissions, especially from coal-fired power plants and vehicles.

The new report does include a bright spot for Chicago specifically. From 2015-17, the city recorded its lowest levels in the study’s 20-year history for both year-round and short-term particle pollution, which is made of tiny particles (soot) that come from sources such as diesel emissions, wildfires and wood-burning devices. The particles can lodge deep in the lungs and trigger asthma attacks, heart attacks and strokes, according to ALA.

This year’s report found that Chicago had a yearly average of just 1.2 unhealthy air quality days in terms of particle pollution.

Although the study provides a big-picture look at Chicago’s air quality, there is not enough data to evaluate short-term effects of pollution in the city, according to the report.

Estimates show that more than 640,000 adults and 130,000 children in the Chicago area suffer from asthma. More than 510,000 adults in the area have been diagnosed with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, also known as COPD, estimates show.

Nationwide, the ALA found that four in 10 Americans now live in areas with unhealthy air.

“We’re heading in the wrong direction when it comes to protecting public health,” Tin said in a statement.

Houston ranked 9 for ozone pollution based on a higher average of unhealthy air days from 2015 to 2017, up two places from last year’s report. For particle pollution, it ranked 17, down from 15. The American Lung Association’s 20th annual report based its rankings on unhealthy air days as recorded using the Air Quality Index. It looks at annual and short term spikes in particle pollution levels.

“I’m surprised and disturbed that Houston’s air quality worsened in this year’s report,” said Luke Metzger, director of Environment Texas. “The trend since 1999 had been one of steady progress and instead now it seems we are backtracking and that’s bad news particularly for the hundreds of thousands of people who have asthma or other vulnerable populations like senior citizens.”

The “State of the Air” is a report card on the two most widespread outdoor air pollutants, ozone pollution or smog, and particle pollution also called soot that is so small that it can lodge deep in the lungs.

Both ozone and particle pollution are dangerous to public health and can increase the risk of premature death and other serious health effects such as lung cancer, asthma attacks, cardiovascular damage, and developmental and reproductive harm, the association warns.

The worst period on record for ozone in Houston was from 1997 to 1999 when there was a weighted average of 110 days of unhealthy air, said JoAnne Strother, director of advocacy for the American Lung Association in Texas. Compared to this year average of 26.7 days, it paints a good picture, she said. “Yes, maybe it still ranked fairly high, but comparing Houston from 1997-1999 to now, the air quality has improved.”

While Houston no longer tops the list for the most polluted, Metzger said the progress that helped improve air quality back in the late 1990s has stalled.

“There are still are some initiatives, but the momentum has declined,” he said. “We are not seeing the same level of support from our state leaders, making this a priority and implementing policies necessary to clean up the air.”

The latest numbers, he said, show the problem hasn’t gone away.

Texas had three of the top 25 most polluted cities — Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth and El Paso — although it still lags behind California, which had 10 of the most polluted cities.

Nationwide, more than four in 10 Americans, about 43.3 percent of the population, live in counties that have monitored unhealthy ozone and/or particle pollution, the report found. And nearly 141.1 million people are exposed to unhealthy air, an increase from the previous two reports but still down from the 166 million in the years covered in the 2016 report (2012-2104).

A big contributor to air quality, according to the report, is climate change as warmer temperatures stimulate the reactions in the atmosphere that cause ozone to form. The reporting years, 2015-2017, are also the three warmest years recorded in global history, the authors said.

Loren Raun, the city’s chief environmental science officer, was not surprised by the high ranking, she said, “it’s a very big problem we got to continue to work on and be ware that it’s affecting people.”

Her office is improving its monitoring of air pollution and sends out alerts when especially vulnerable populations and those who suffer from asthma who may be affected.

Using 911 data for ambulance-treated asthma attacks, Raun’s office analyzed how air pollution is associated with asthma attacks, she said. Levels don’t have to reach an “ozone action day” for people who, for instance suffer from asthma, to be impacted, she said. Multiple days of unhealthy air and the different pollutants might be enough for them to take precautionary measures.

Air pollution is a big burden to the city, she said.

“We have 6,000 children in HISD (Houston Independent School District) who have asthma,” she said, “It’s the biggest chronic disease problem they face.”

Which is a concern, she added, because if children are impacted and their asthma isn’t in control, they aren’t in school, which means they can’t excel and learn. “Everything that pollution affects is a cost to society.”

Current models estimate that more than 60 percent of ozone pollution is from cars, according to Raun, and to address that, the city is trying to encourage practices such as the use of mass transit and transitioning to fuel-efficient or low-emission vehicles.

“If we could do that, we could come a long way to improving our air quality,” she said, as well as “continue to work on getting industries to meet permit requirements and support TCEQ (Texas Commission on Environmental Quality) in enforcing permitting requirements.”

The latest numbers demonstrate air pollution is getting better, Strother said, but more needs to be done. “It’s important that we call on the current administration and Congress to adopt science-based solutions to reduce emissions that are causing climate change and to ensure no community near a polluting source is left behind.”

Arizona’s capital city ranks seventh for dirtiest air among American cities when it comes to ozone, according to the American Lung Association’s annual State of the Air report for 2018, which was released Tuesday.

“We were ranked eighth last year, so we did have more days where the air quality was bad,” said JoAnna Strother, director of advocacy for the American Lung Association of Arizona.

From 2017 to 2018, Phoenix moved from 20th to 13th nationwide for 24-hour particle pollution and from 50th to 32nd for year-round particle pollution.

Strother said some of the blame goes to extra smoke and particles from last summer’s California wildfires that lingered in Phoenix’s heat.

“We have sunshine most of the year,” she said. “It gives us the perfect recipe to cook up ozone. That’s why we’re seeing some of those high levels.”

More car emissions are also culprits.

“If everybody just committed to maybe commuting one day less, or using another form of transportation, that all adds and helps us to clean up our air,” she said.

We're sorry. This podcast episode is no longer available. Aired: April 25, 2019 | Transcript

California cities claimed seven of the top 10 spots in the American Lung Association’s State of the Air report.

San Diego is the sixth smoggiest city.

American Lung Association officials said local air quality has been declining in the past five years. The Association’s Deborah Kelly says the number of smoggy days in San Diego is up 42% over the past five years.

The number of unhealthy ozone days in 2014 was 26. That number climbed to 45 this year.

The increase comes after the number of high ozone days steadily fell for 15 years.

Lung Association officials said climate change makes things worse. The nearly three years of data covered in the report came during some of the hottest temperatures in global history.

“The hotter it is, the more ozone is made, the faster it is made. The worse our air quality gets and of course, the impacts of climate change just get that much worse,” said Debra Kelley, of the American Lung Association in California, San Diego.

Los Angeles, Visalia and Bakersfield are the top three cities. Fresno at 4, Sacramento at 5 and San Jose at 8 are the other California cities that made the list.

Phoenix at No. 7, Houston at No. 9 and New York at No. 10 rounded out the smoggy list.

Smog is created when carbon emissions, typically from cars and trucks, is mixed with nitrogen oxides and is then heated by the sun. The pollution can make it hard to breathe and damages the lungs.

Tougher pollution rules can help and preserve California’s right to set stronger pollution standards for cars is key.

“Those tailpipe emission standards, which are making a bad situation, less bad, are under assault from the federal government and Donald Trump. We currently are in litigation. If we lose that litigation, we are talking about 100s of millions of cubic tons of new pollution that will enter California. We have to stop the damage and stop the bleeding and then we have to take decisive action to make it better,” said Nathan Fletcher, San Diego County supervisor and member of the State Air Resources Board.

El Centro also got some negative attention in the report. The Imperial County city is the nation’s eighth worst city for year-round particle pollution, which can cause a number of health problems like asthma.

The report, released this week, is produced annually by the American Lung Association and measures high ozone days, as well as short- and long-term particle pollution.

Across the U.S., the report found that air quality worsened in many cities and that more than 43 percent of people in the U.S. live in counties with unhealthy air.

In Dallas-Fort Worth, air quality got better, albeit not by much. In this year’s report, the area dropped to 17th on the list of most-polluted cities, one spot better than in the 2018 report.

At No. 9, Houston was the only Texas city to rank higher on the ""most-polluted"" list, according to the report.

The top three cities on the list are in California. The Los Angeles-Long Beach area took the top spot, followed by Visalia and Bakersfield.

North Texas suffered through fewer days with unhealthy levels of ozone and lower year-round particle pollution, according to the report.

For the recorded period, the area had no days when short-term particle pollution — days when smog levels spike — climbed to unhealthy levels. That made Dallas-Fort Worth one of the cleanest areas for short-term particle pollution, the report found.

The improvements are not much to celebrate, said JoAnna Strother, director of advocacy at the American Lung Association.

""Dallas residents should be aware that we're breathing unhealthy air, placing our health and lives at risk,"" Strother said in a written statement.

In the area, more than 2.6 million people are at risk when it comes to poor air quality, according to the report. The figure includes people with asthma, lung disease or lung cancer, heart disease and diabetes, as well as those living in poverty, children and adults older than 65.

Ozone is an odorless gas, usually present in the upper levels of the atmosphere, where it protects the earth from the sun’s ultraviolet rays. When ozone reaches ground level, it becomes the main ingredient in smog and can be harmful and create respiratory issues for some. For the number of high ozone days, the area received an “F” on the annual report card.

Particle-pollution — soot or tiny particles in the air — can come from several sources, including coal-fired power plants, diesel emissions, wildfires and wood-burning devices, Strother said.

Strother credited any improvements in air quality to the cleanup of coal-fired power plants and companies that have put “old, dirty” diesel engines out of use.

Rising temperatures, however, present another challenge. The report found that warmer temperatures help ozone form, saying that rising average annual temperatures will make matters worse in coming years.

So far this year for Dallas-Fort Worth, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality has issued only two ozone action days, when air quality levels could be unhealthy for sensitive groups.

As summer nears and temperatures rise, however, KXAS-TV (NBC5) meteorologist Samantha Davies warned that the area will likely see more ozone action days.

On those days, the TCEQ recommends limiting time outdoors, carpooling and shortening driving times when possible.",['Subsistence - Physiology']
https://www.sanjoseinside.com/news/silicon-valley-schools-shut-down-due-to-air-quality-concerns/,['San Jose'],A look inside San Jose politics and culture,"This week’s unhealthy air quality—caused by the ongoing Camp Fire, the deadliest, most destructive blaze in state history—has prompted some schools and most colleges in the South Bay to temporarily shut down. Absent from the list of closures, however, are the vast majority of the area’s public K-12 schools, which chose to remain in session Friday but to keep kids indoors.

According to CALmatters, more than a million school kids—18 percent of the public school population—were sent home this week because of smoke-related campus shutdowns. A spokesman for the California Department of Education (CDE) called the wave of wildfire-prompted cancelations one of the state’s largest ever.

Locally, San Jose State University was one of the first to call off classes Thursday and plans to do the same through Saturday. Several local private prep schools, universities and community colleges will close their doors for the rest of the week as well. Santa Clara University plans to go dark through Sunday.

The Foothill-De Anza Community College District canceled classes at both campuses. As did the San Jose-Evergreen Community College District. Presentation High, a private all-girls parochial school, told students to stay home Friday.

The Santa Clara County Office of Education (SCCOE), on the other hand, is urging public K-12 schools to remain open. SCCOE Superintendent Mary Ann Dewan sent out an advisory, saying that after consulting with public health officials, she decided that it would be best for schools to continue as scheduled Friday but to limit outdoor activity.

“It is my goal to keep students in schools when possible, as schools provide a safe environment,” Dewan said. “Our goal is to ensure student safety.”

The San Jose Unified, the largest public school district in the South Bay, will heed her advice and continue sessions on Friday. It appears that most of the 31 local school districts will follow suit, a trend that drew some backlash online.

Parents responded to many of the announcements on school district Facebook pages by questioning the decision to stay open when so many other campuses—include the all 18 in the Contra Costa Unified School District up in the East Bay—planned to call off classes in response to air quality that became increasingly hazardous as the week went on.

“If colleges feel the need to shut down why are our kids still being required to attend and absences for their health are unexcused,” one parents wrote on a Facebook thread about South Bay public schools being notably absent from the list of closures.

Several people on social media connected the decision to the public K-12 system’s attendance-based funding formula. “Because the public schools only receive their per-diem per student if the students attend,” someone responded. “Clearly the money they get is more important than the safety of the students. It’s very sad because many of these children bike and walk to school each day.”

Others applauded the decision because many families lack the resources to find someone to watch their kids on a work day. And because for many low-income households, schools are the safest place to send their children.

Though the state bases funding on average daily attendance, it should be noted that the CDE grants waivers for safety and health-related closures.

Other parents supported the SCCOE’s guidance because closures would burden many families, especially those that lack the resources to find someone to watch their kids on a work day. And because for many low-income, under-resourced households, schools are a reliable place to feed their children and a safe place to send them during the day.

""This afternoon, the index was 182 in San Jose, 186 in San Rafael and 217 in Oakland; these readings are in the ""unhealthy"" range. ""Good"" air quality falls in the 0 to 50 range."" https://t.co/HZXBnka7NB — kiersten (@kierstennamber) November 15, 2018

The Santa Clara County Department of Public Health issued an advisory of its own, directing people to stay inside and avoid exposure until the smoke subsides.

On Thursday, the regional average Air Quality Index was 194—the equivalent of smoking several cigarettes. Parts of the South Bay surpassed 200, which is considered “very unhealthy.” The latest air quality readings are available online here.

The Bay Area Air Quality Management District has deemed every day through next week a spare-the-air day, which means it’s illegal to burn wood, because of particulate levels deemed very unhealthy. Meanwhile, pulmonologists have been telling reporters that it would be wise for workers in the South Bay to stay indoors until the smoke dissipates.

As of Thursday afternoon, the Camp Fire had incinerated more than 140,000 acres, killed 56 people and destroyed nearly 8,700 homes.

https://www.austinmonitor.com/stories/2019/06/austin-at-risk-for-violating-federal-ozone-standards/,['Austin'],Austin at risk for violating federal ozone standards - Austin Monitor,"Ozone levels in the Austin area have been hovering just below federal violation levels for the last six years.

Ground-level ozone – or “bad” ozone – is an ingredient in smog and a primary pollutant that can cause a number of health problems.

With weather patterns becoming more extreme due to climate change, Central Texas summer temperatures will be hotter, and that means a higher risk of bad ozone days. Last year, Austin had 10 days of air quality deemed unhealthy for sensitive groups, which follows closely on the heels of 2015’s 12 days of bad air quality.

Air quality is determined to be “bad” if any pollutant rises above the predetermined compliance levels set by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Standards implemented by the EPA in 2015 state that good air quality permits 55 parts per billion of all air pollutants. Bad air quality is determined if the air has 71-85 parts per billion of all air pollutants.

“Ground-level ozone is like a sunburn for your lungs,” Phoebe Romero with the Office of Sustainability told the Environmental Commission at its June 5 meeting. Risk of exposure to bad ozone is elevated in the summertime months because more people are outside and temperatures are hotter.

High temperatures and blazing sunshine contribute to worsened air quality by magnifying the greenhouse effect that traps and radiates heat within the atmosphere.

Austin is the largest city that is in compliance with all of the required atmospheric levels mandated by the EPA’s established National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Yet the city is on the cusp of being out of compliance in 2019, Andrew Hoekzema with the Capital Area Council of Governments told the Environmental Commission. Last year, he said, “We managed to remain in compliance just barely.”

So far in 2019, there have been no days that have reached unhealthy levels of air quality. Seventeen days were considered “moderate” in terms of air quality. However, Hoekzema told the commissioners it is still too early to determine if this year will have fewer bad air quality days than last year. August and September, he explained, are the worst days of the year for ozone, and there is a risk of bad ozone up through the end of October.

If this year’s air quality is any worse than last year’s, Hoekzema says the city will be in violation of national air quality standards. If that happens, there can be consequences even beyond public health.

Hoekzema told the Austin Monitor in an email, “If EPA designates an area as ‘nonattainment,’ new permitting requirements and restrictions on construction and expansion of large point sources of emissions (factories, power plants) would take effect. Also, there would be new restrictions and requirements on federal approvals of transportation plans and funding and other types of projects (like approving rail projects or airport expansions). Some of these restrictions can continue to apply for at least 20 years even after the area is able to bring its air pollution back into attainment of the standards due to ‘maintenance’ requirements in the Clean Air Act.”

“I think the average person in Austin knows zero about what is going on,” Commissioner Mary Ann Neely said.

Romero noted that outreach is of primary importance as the city works toward the goals of Net Zero Community GHG Emissions and 65 percent renewable energy by 2027. Neely told commissioners that those who live in Austin are the ones who will make the difference by taking everyday steps to lower their own emissions by driving less and using fossil fuel-powered appliances sparingly.

Chair Linda Guerrero pointed out that there are also steps that the city can take to limit emissions by creating ordinances that allow for enforceable limits on building sites. “Because right now, we have nothing,” she said.

The American Lung Association’s 2018 “State of the Air” report is good news for Florida. It shows the state is improving overall, but Jacksonville is one of several cities which could have cleaner air.

The report says Duval County has earned a “C” for high smog days and for high soot days, the county earned a “B.”

The report finds that Jacksonville's soot levels are slightly higher than last year's report.

Pollution particles can come from coal-fired power plants, diesel emissions, wildfires and wood-burning devices.

Scientists said the particles are so small they can lodge deep in the lungs and trigger asthma attacks, heart attacks and strokes.

Other Northeast Florida cities, including Lake City and Gainesville, ranked as some of the cleanest cities in the nation for short-term particle pollution.

Looking at Florida overall, the Sunshine State did see a slight drop in smog.

https://patch.com/florida/miami/cancer-linked-contaminants-found-miami-dades-water-report,['Miami'],Cancer-Linked Contaminants Found In Miami-Dade's Water: Report,"MIAMI, FL — Most Americans don't think twice about drinking a glass of water. A report released Wednesday, though, found more than 270 harmful contaminants in local drinking water across the nation, including in Miami-Dade County. The substances are linked to cancer, damage to the brain and nervous system, hormonal disruption, problems in pregnancy and other serious health conditions.

The nonprofit Environmental Working Group, collaborating with outside scientists, aggregated and analyzed data from almost 50,000 local water utilities in all 50 states.

The organization found a troubling discrepancy between the current legal limits for contaminants and the most recent authoritative studies of what is safe to consume.

In Miami-Dade, the group found 21 contaminants across our water supply between 2012 and 2017.

""A lot of these legal limits are outdated and not necessarily the safe level, and the EWG really wants to fill that gap,"" Evans said. ""The federal government has not been able to, or is not willing to, set those new regulations to protect public health. We're trying to fill the gap to let people know, based on the latest science, what the safe levels of contaminants in water are.""

Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Authority serves 2.3 million people, according to the agency's Jennifer L. Messemer-Skold, who said Miami-Dade water meets all federal, state and local drinking water standards.

""The federal Safe Drinking Water Act provides a national process and framework for determining drinking water standards to insure the safety of drinking water,"" she explained. ""The process for establishing standards based upon scientifically verified health affects data and measurement techniques is overseen by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. ""

""States may establish more stringent standards if they chose to do so,"" she said. ""Organizations and individuals may have different opinions regarding the adequacy of federal and state drinking water standards and the associated margins of safety that are included in those standards and their recommended alternatives may not include the economic and technical feasibility of treating large volumes of water to the standards they are advocating.""

She said drinking water standards are developed with the most vulnerable people of the population in mind.

Messemer-Skold told Patch the agency will continue to provide ""affordable water"" to its customers. She said county water officials will continue to meet all standards set by the state of Florida as well as federal agencies charged with the responsibility of protecting public health.

The following contaminants were detected above the environmental group's own recommended health guidelines in the Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Authority:

Arsenic (Name of contaminant)

Cancer (Potential Effect)

292 (Times the rate of suggested EWG guideline)

1.17 ppb (Rate this contaminant appears)

0.004 ppb (EWG Health Guideline #)

10 ppb (Legal limit)

2. Chromium (Name of contaminant)

Cancer (Potential Effect)

4.3 (Times the rate of suggested EWG guideline)

0.0857 ppb (Rate this contaminant appears)

0.02 ppb (EWG Health Guideline #)

(No Legal limit)

3. Perfluoroheptanoic acid (Name of contaminant)

Unspecified (Potential Effect)

5.5 (Times the rate of suggested EWG guideline)

5.50 (Rate this contaminant appears)

1 ppt (EWG Health Guideline)

(No Legal limit)

4. Radium (Name of contaminant)

Cancer (Potential Effect)

3.3 (Times the rate of suggested EWG guideline)

0.17 pCi/L (Rate this contaminant appears)

0.05 pCi/L (EWG Health Guideline #)

5 pCi/L(Legal limit)

5. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (Name of contaminant)

Unspecified (Potential Effect)

7.2 (Times the rate of suggested EWG guideline)

7.17 ppt (Rate this contaminant appears)

1 ppt (EWG Health Guideline #)

(No Legal limit)

6. Total trihalomethanes (Name of contaminant)

Cancer (Potential Effect)

235 (Times the rate of suggested EWG guideline)

35.3 ppb (Rate this contaminant appears)

0.15 ppb (EWG Health Guideline #)

80 ppb (Legal limit)

In the case of polyfluorinated substances, or PFAs, the environmental group estimated up to 110 million Americans could have the potentially cancer-causing, immune-system damaging contaminant in their drinking water. Yet the EPA requires drinking water utilities across the country to test for only six of 14 known substances in the category.

A variety of other contaminants often found in the water of millions of Americans can profoundly impact health. They include lead, which has been linked to brain damage in small children; arsenic, which can cause cancer; and copper, which can be harmful to infants.

The EPA did not respond to numerous requests by Patch seeking comment on the findings of the study.

According to the environmental group, many of the 270-plus contaminants detected through water sampling are at levels deemed legal under the federal Safe Drinking Water Act, yet are above levels that recent studies have found to pose possible health risks.

Visit the environmental group's web page for Miami-Dade Water and Sewer Authority to see the recommended ways to combat the specific substances in your drinking water and the risks that they pose.

The environmental group has a clear opinion on the federal government's handling of water safety.

""The regulatory system meant to ensure the safety of America's drinking water is broken. The inexcusable failure of the federal government's responsibility to protect public health means there are no legal limits for more than 160 unregulated contaminants in U.S. tap water,"" Environmental Working Group researchers stated in its ""State of American Drinking Water.""

A focal point of the organization's concern is the Environmental Protection Agency's refusal to add a single new contaminant to the toxic chemicals list covered by the Safe Drinking Water Act in almost 20 years.

Independent experts agree.

""With the science on what we call 'emerging contaminants' continuing to grow, it is clear that there are components of our tap water that can be improved,"" Kristin Strock, professor of Environmental Science at Dickinson College, told Patch.

Strock, who is not affiliated with the environmental group, also emphasized the challenges in the process of federally regulating harmful contaminants, suggesting the current system is somewhat backward.

""The road to regulating harmful contaminants is difficult, as our current construct for ensuring clean water is based on 'proving' that something is harmful before it is regulated as opposed to assuming contaminants could be harmful and 'proving' them safe before allowing them to go into industrial production and, as a result, our environment,"" she said. ""The EPA has been working on identifying safe limits for a number of these emerging contaminants and continues to work on the problem.""

The Environmental Working Group also noted that the every-day person is frustratingly helpless to the chemicals going into their water supply, and the subsequent costs associated with different water filtering techniques.

Olga Naidenko, vice president of science investigation at the group, further explained, ""Industries and companies that released PFAS into the environment and drinking water sources — should be responsible to covering such costs, as it is unfair for homeowners to be saddled with costs for pollution they did not create.""

The water group does offer information, though, on filtering technologies that you can use to dramatically reduce water contamination. Filtering technology will help. Carbon filters, for example, will reduce many, but not all, contaminants.

How to Check Contaminants In Your Water:

The environmental group's public database catalogues contaminants in every water system in the country — the first such database of its kind. First, select the state where you live, and you'll see state-level data. For more local information, enter your ZIP code.

After you enter your ZIP code, you'll be directed to a page showing the name of your water utility system. Select ""View Utility"" to see which contaminants were identified in your area.

What You Can Do

For those with concerns, the environmental group provides a guide to buying water filters. If you find your local water supply has a particularly high level of a dangerous chemical, you can search for a filter that best blocks the specific substance.

While water filters are important, the group also acknowledges they are more of a Band-Aid solution than an actual fix.

""We really want to iterate that's a first-line, temporary measure,"" Evans told Patch. ""It's what you can do today to protect yourself, but really we want long-term permanent change, and that's going to happen at the community level.""

Subsequently, the environmental group has created a set of seven questions to ask your elected officials about tap water.

The organization strongly believes that everyone can help in the battle to improve tap water safety.

""We absolutely believe in the power of personal advocacy — for individuals to reach out to their local elected officials of all levels. The power of people can come into play,"" Naidenko said.

“The Department of Watershed Management’s website ... will be offline for server maintenance and updates until further notice,” the City of Atlanta wrote on Twitter.

Atlanta’s watershed department was among the operations hard-hit by the March 23 attack that continues to block access to databases, postpone municipal court dates and stifle the city’s ability to collect some payments for public services.

Employees with the water department said they were unable to turn on their work computers or gain wireless internet access for roughly a week after the attack, but they were instructed to report to their offices at City Hall anyway.

Many of the department’s systems have lumbered back to life in recent days, but there is still disruption, said one employee, who asked not to be identified.

“There’s definitely work not being done and there’s definitely bills not being able to be paid,” the employee said.

More than half of the 15 beaches where the nonprofit group Save the Harbor/Save the Bay conducted testing last year posted perfect water quality scores, meaning all samples examined for bacteria were deemed safe for swimming under state public health standards.

SWAMPSCOTT — Water quality grades are in for urban beaches in Greater Boston and, for the most part, the ocean is clear.

The water quality findings for beaches from Hull to parts of the North Shore were made public Sunday in an annual report from Save the Harbor/Save the Bay.

Bruce Berman, the group’s director of strategy and communications, said the high marks for many beaches are significant given the record 61 inches of rain that fell in Massachusetts last year. Without the proper infrastructure, stormwater unleashed during storms can pollute beach water, he said.

“The improvements that we made really work in wet weather,” Berman said Saturday.

Two beaches in South Boston, Nantasket Beach in Hull, Nahant Beach in Nahant, Winthrop Beach in Winthrop, Short Beach in Revere, and Savin Hill Beach in Dorchester aced their water quality tests last year, the report said.

Weekly testing began on May 24, 2018, and daily testing at King’s Beach and four other beaches in East Boston, Dorchester, and Quincy began on June 7, 2018. Testing concluded on Sept. 3, 2018.

Alerts about high bacteria levels, Berman said, are based on tests of water samples collected a day ahead of time. He urged swimmers to use common sense when deciding whether to go in the water.

Save the Harbor/Save the Bay began its water quality testing program at urban beaches in 2011, Berman said, the same year the Boston Harbor cleanup project marked a major milestone with the opening of a massive sewage holding tank in South Boston.

The 2.1-mile tank under Day Boulevard is credited with keeping dirty water out of the harbor when it rains. The federal court case that led to the $5 billion Boston Harbor cleanup ended in 2016 after than three decades.

M Street Beach in South Boston holds the distinction of having an average water quality safety rating of 100 percent over six years, the report said.

King’s Beach and Tenean Beach have consistently ranked at the bottom of the list.

Last summer, King’s Beach was safe for swimming 75 percent of the time and Tenean Beach was safe for swimming 78 percent of the time, the report said.

Going back to 2013, Tenean Beach had the lowest average safety levels, according to the report, and King’s Beach was second to last.

Swimming in waters with high bacteria levels puts people at risk of developing rashes, eye infections, and gastrointestinal illnesses, Berman said.

At Tenean Beach, high bacteria levels are believed to be caused by sewage systems that were improperly connected to stormwater pipes, he said. The Boston Water and Sewer Commission has been working to identify problem connections, he said, and reroute waste.

Dolores Randolph, a commission spokeswoman, said Tenean Beach has been a challenge. Problem spots have been identified and fixed, she said, only for testing to reveal other areas that requires attention.

The commission, she said, has begun repairs on a problem spot that was recently identified and feels optimistic about the work.

At King’s Beach, the bacteria levels have been linked to problems with stormwater pipes in Lynn and sewer systems in Swampscott, Berman said.

In 2015, Swampscott agreed to pay a $65,000 civil penalty after the US Environmental Protection Agency accused the town of discharging pollutants into its stormwater drainage system.

Since then, the town has spent $4 million to enclose clay pipes in protective sleeves to prevent leaks, said Town Administrator Sean R. Fitzgerald.

Fixing the problem entirely, however, will require financial assistance from state and federal authorities, he said.

“We can’t afford to do this all on the local real estate tax base,” Fitzgerald said.

In Lynn, city officials are trying to identify broken pipes and spots where sewage systems were incorrectly linked to stormwater pipes, Berman said.

Lynn and Swampscott are eligible for state funds from a $20 million environmental bond bill that was authorized two years ago, though the money has yet to be appropriated, Berman said.

The state Department of Conservation and Recreation, which oversees the beaches, is committed to their protection and improvement, a spokeswoman said.

Lynn Mayor Thomas M. McGee didn’t respond Saturday to requests for comment.

Sean Regan, 36, of Swampscott, brought his 2-year-old daughter Annabelle to King’s Beach Saturday afternoon. He said he wasn’t surprised to hear the beach fared poorly on water quality tests, but believes the beach is relatively clean compared to other bodies of water nationwide.

“It doesn’t concern me all that much,” Regan said. “We probably wouldn’t choose this beach to go swimming in, but at the same time I don’t think it’s toxic.”

Shanel Anderson, 35, said she wasn’t aware that King’s Beach sits low in the rankings compared to nearby beaches. Officials need to do a better job of informing the public of bacteria levels, she said.

“We love the beach. This is pretty much our standard activity to do,” said Anderson, who visited the beach with her sons, Solomon, 8, and Kingston, 4. “I never think twice about it. It’s something that I’m definitely going to think about from now on.”

Robert Tucker, president of the nonprofit organization Friends of Lynn and Nahant Beach, said officials in Lynn and Swampscott haven’t done enough to improve water quality at King’s Beach. “It’s just not getting resolved the way it should be resolved,” he said.

Flooding at the West Point treatment plant in Seattle’s Magnolia neighborhood has reduced the plant’s operation to 50 percent. The plant currently does not have adequate capacity to perform state-mandated secondary treatment of the tens of millions of gallons of wastewater and raw sewage that pass through it daily.

“We’re weeks out on getting it back up and running but I don’t have a good estimate on that right now,” said Mark Isaacson, the county’s wastewater treatment director.

Isaacson said the damage to the plant — service corridors filled with 10 feet of water at the height of the storm — was considerable.

“If I could employ every electrician in the country, I’d do it,” he said.

Seattle’s stormwater and sewage system was designed decades ago. The system eventually combines both sewage and stormwater into one pipe. When heavy rains hit Seattle, the system can be overwhelmed.

Untreated wastewater

Since the most recent severe rains began on Feb. 9, more that 260 million gallons of untreated wastewater have flowed into the Sound from the West Point plant. Considerably more has dumped into the sound during 14 hours of additional flooding between 4 p.m. Wednesday and 6 a.m. Thursday, but the county hasn’t yet been able to assess that amount.

The West Point plant when fully operational can process 450 million gallons of wastewater each day. Most winter days it processes considerably less, in the neighborhood of 145 million gallons. But record rains can overwhelm the facility and the county lacks enough capacity to divert the additional flow. So a portion of it – in this case millions of gallons – ends in in the Sound in the form of raw sewage.

A spokesperson with state Department of Ecology said the state is monitoring West Point and that its current crippled operation – regardless of rainfall – won’t be able treat water well enough for state standards.

Isaacson agreed.

“We’ve reported and have been working with the Department of Ecology since the morning of the 9th when this started,” Isaacson said. “They are well aware what’s going on.

“They have the potential to fine us. I am sure they will review our work.”

More rain is expected in coming days.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday accused the city of San Francisco of violating the Clean Water Act by allegedly dumping untreated wastewater into oceans.

In a letter to San Francisco Public Utilities Commission General Manager Harlan Kelly, Regional EPA Administrator Michael Stoker said the city is failing to operate and properly maintain its wastewater collection facilities and failing to comply with water quality standards, among other violations.

The letter alleged the city discharged some two billion gallons of untreated sewer water into the ocean annually.

“The failure to properly operate and maintain the city’s sewage collection and treatment facilities creates public health risks. For example, lack of proper operation and maintenance has caused force main and pump station failures that have diverted substantial volumes of raw and partially-treated sewage to flow across the beaches and into the San Francisco Bay and the Pacific Ocean,” Stoker wrote.

“There have been instances of sewage flowing into the streets and entering people’s homes. Moreover, the city’s data also show other pollutants of significant concern such as copper, zinc, lead, cyanide and ammonia that can threaten the water quality of the Bay and the ocean,” the letter said.

If the city doesn’t take immediate action to correct the allegations, the EPA said it could pursue injunctive relief or civil penalties.

In a statement, San Francisco Mayor London Breed responded to the letter, defending the city’s sewer system and calling the allegations inaccurate.

“The notice of violation issued today contained a series of mischaracterizations, inaccuracies and falsehoods, and is the latest example of the Trump administration’s attack on our city and our state,” she said.

“San Francisco has a combined sewer system, one of the best and most effective in the country, that ensures that all debris that flow into storm drains are filtered out at the city’s wastewater treatment plants. No debris flow out into the Bay or the Ocean. In fact, the EPA recently awarded San Francisco the largest, merit-based award it has under its competitive loan program for water infrastructure,” she said.

“President Trump’s sudden concern for California’s environment is ironic considering he is undercutting the state’s ambitious vehicle emission standards and climate change plans,” she said.

Breed added that the city is currently working with the EPA to replace aging infrastructure through the city’s Sewer System Improvement Program.

State Sen. Scott Wiener, D-San Francisco, said, “The same Trump EPA that is dismantling environmental protections around the country is now making fraudulent claims about San Francisco’s combined sewer system—a system that is a national model of sustainability.

“The EPA has repeatedly signed off on San Francisco’s sewer system over the years, yet the EPA is now issuing misleading statements about it. This ‘Notice of Violation’ by Trump’s EPA is a fraudulent political attack on San Francisco by a collapsing Administration desperate to rile up its base,” he said.

Detroit — A five-year, $500 million effort was announced Thursday to replace water and sewer pipes throughout the city, an undertaking city officials say would be the first massive upgrade of water and sewer lines since 1930.

Mayor Mike Duggan and officials with the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department announced a data-driven approach to upgrade the city’s water and sewer systems at a press conference in the city's Russell Woods neighborhood, one of the communities identified by the water officials as needing the quickest fix. The approach is aimed at replacing or repairing the most vulnerable pipes first.

It's also the first major step in replacing an estimated 125,000 lead service pipes in the city, officials said. Lead pipes were at the center of controversy in Flint's water crisis.

Detroit's data-driven approach will assess individual neighborhoods that allow water officials ""to figure out where are the oldest pipes,"" Duggan said. ""Where are they most likely to break? And how do we put our investment in it?""

More than 50 miles of water main and sewer collection pipe will be replaced or lined this year. And projects aimed at better managing 37 million gallons of stormwater will be done to prevent flooding.

The water and sewerage department will replace existing lead service lines that often connect to older residences to the main water and sewer lines. Lead pipes can cause serious health risks if the pipes become corroded and particles enter drinking water.

It could take decades to get to all of the city's water and sewer pipes, officials said.

“We are responsible for 2,700 miles of transmission and distribution water mains and nearly 3,000 miles of sewer collection piping,” Brown said.

In 2018, the city upgraded 25 miles of water main, lined 22 miles of sewer piping and replaced 173 lead service lines. This was the most water and sewer construction in the past 15 years, officials said.

In late 2017, the city started the data-driven approach with pilot areas in North Rosedale Park and Cornerstone Village by flushing the hydrants, detecting leaks in the water mains and placing cameras in the sewer pipes.

Water and sewer condition assessments have since also been done in Brewster Douglass, Brightmoor, Jefferson Chalmers, Miller Grove, Minock Park, Rosedale Park (south), and Riverdale.

The results of the assessments are being reviewed and designs are underway for the infrastructure that needs rehabilitation.

The data was used to design water and sewer upgrades for the two neighborhoods where construction will begin this year.

Palencia Mobley, DWSD deputy director and chief engineer, said ""so far,"" the city has found that one out of every four miles of infrastructure needs ""replacement or rehabilitation.”

The $500 million to pay for the upgrades will come from several sources. One is the leasing revenues from the regional water system, called the Great Lakes Water Authority, created during the city's bankruptcy. The city gets $50 million in annual lease payments.

Brown also noted a 94% collections rate from people who are behind on their water bills. That's up from 77% in 2016. That adds up to about $60 million in additional revenue. Further, the city's improved financial status allows it to borrow money from Wall Street.

Still, the city will need further assistance to meet a new state mandate that requires public utilities to dig up lead service lines and replace them all within 20 years. The rule is in response to the Flint water crisis.

Brown said the city will need ""financial assistance"" to step up its pace of lead pipe removal to meet the 20-year goal.

https://www.wastetodaymagazine.com/article/minneapolis-bans-residential-battery-recycling-waste-collection/,['Minneapolis'],Minneapolis ends residential battery recycling collection,"CalRecycle and Cal OES joined forces after the fire to remove debris, the total tonnage of which equated to 10 Empire State Buildings.

On the heels of the one-year anniversary of the Camp Fire, the most deadly wildfire in state history, the California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery (CalRecycle), based in Sacramento, and the Governor’s Office of Emergency Services (Cal OES) have announced the completion of debris removal on nearly 11,000 properties.

The fire started on Nov. 8, 2018, in Northern California's Butte County and wasn’t fully contaminated until 17 days later. It caused at least 85 fatalities. In addition, more than 150,000 acres had been burned and close to 19,000 buildings were destroyed. The total cost of the fire damage was estimated at $16.5 billion.

CalRecycle says in a news release that the debris removal project was the largest of its type in state history and was jointly managed by Cal OES and CalRecycle. Crews removed more than 3.66 million tons—or 7.3 billion pounds—of ash, debris, metal, concrete, and contaminated soil in nine months as part of California’s Consolidated Debris Removal Program. The total tonnage of debris removed during the cleanup is equivalent to 10 Empire State Buildings.

“This is a story of resilience, and I am inspired by the people of Paradise’s grit and their resolve to move forward after last year’s devastating fire,” says California Gov. Gavin Newsom in the news release. “Our state continues to stand with the communities and all families that were impacted.”

Camp Fire recovery

The cleanup effort spanned approximately 13,400 properties. It was divided into two phases: removal of household hazardous waste and removal of other fire-related debris.

The first phase of the cleanup began Dec. 3 and took two months as crews sorted through on-site rubble and ash to remove remnants of household hazardous waste, including paints, cleaners, solvents, oils, batteries, pesticides, compressed cylinders and tanks and easily identifiable asbestos.

Cleanup crews started the second phase—which involved site assessment and documentation, debris removal, erosion control measures and final inspection—Jan. 7. It cost an estimated $1.35 billion, though final calculations are still being carried out, according to CalRecycle.

After a competitive bid process that ended Jan. 22, CalRecycle selected ECC Constructors LLC, Burlingame, California; SPSG Partners JV, a joint venture including Sukut Construction, Pacific States Environmental Contractors, and Goodfellow Bros.; and Sarasota, Florida-based Ceres Environmental Services Inc., doing business as Environmental & Demolition Services Group, as the primary contractors for the cleanup. Each primary contractor employed a number of subcontractors to help facilitate the cleanup.

The debris removal operation was part of a wider effort by Newsom to help communities impacted by destructive wildfires rebuild and recover, CalRecycle says.

“Debris removal is an important first step in the rebuilding of Butte County and the Town of Paradise,” CalRecycle Director Scott Smithline says. “From our contractors to our state, local and federal partners, we are proud of everyone who has worked to help this community rebuild while keeping public and environmental health at the forefront.”

“Today’s announcement marks an important milestone in helping Butte County rebuild and recover. The hard work of local, state and federal agencies following this catastrophic event and the unprecedented speed of this operation is a testament to the resolve and resiliency of Californians,” says Mark Ghilarducci, director of Cal OES.

The debris removal program, implemented in coordination with local governments, offered survivors a streamlined option to clear their properties at no out-of-pocket cost. The state, along with local and federal partners, has assisted with multiple aspects of the recovery process, including:

• Establishing temporary short-term housing solutions for nearly 700 households displaced by the fire.

• Facilitating technical and grant expertise for the Paradise Irrigation District to help restore Paradise’s water system.

• Supporting public assistance projects to restore public infrastructure.

• Providing support and coordination for emotional and behavioral needs of children and their families.

Newsom also approved a rural designation for Paradise and other surrounding parts of Butte County, making the areas eligible for additional funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture Rural Development Program funds totaling more than $500 million.



Following the Camp Fire, California is the first state nationally to establish the Interagency Recovery Coordination functions—a federal model—to directly assist town and county officials with long-term recovery needs and initiatives.

https://www.tampabay.com/news/localgovernment/Here-s-how-to-recycle-your-Gasparilla-beads-in-Tampa_164852952/,['Tampa'],Here's how to recycle your Gasparilla beads in Tampa,"For the first time ever, Tampa will take part in recycling some of the millions of plastic beads tossed to the clamoring crowds during Gasparilla celebrations.

The program was started independent of the city in 2017, when Krispy Kreme partnered with MacDonald Training Center to swap beads for doughnuts.

Clients of the center, which serves individuals with developmental disabilities, spent a week untangling and repackaging close to 1,000 pounds of beads that were then sold to the all-female Bonney-Read Krewe to use in the 2018 Gasparilla parades.

The used beads were sold for $35 a case, a sizable discount from new beads imported from China that can run $45 to $65.

They account for a fraction of an estimated 200,000-plus-pounds of beads used in Gasparilla celebrations, much of which lands in the trash. But with the city's help, the training center said it hopes to step up the recycling program significantly.

Following this year's Gasparilla, there will be bead recycling bins at the Port Tampa, Kate Jackson and Copeland Park city community centers and the Loretta Ingraham Recreation Complex.

Krispy Kreme on Kennedy Boulevard in Tampa will exchange 12 pounds of beads for a dozen doughnuts on Feb. 24 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., and beads can be dropped off directly to MacDonald Training Center at 5420 W Cypress St. in Tampa during regular business hours.

The hundreds of city workers and volunteers from Keep Tampa Bay Beautiful who clean up the 24 tons of trash left behind at the parade route Sunday will also salvage non-broken beads and turn them over to the training center.

This year, there won't be bead recycling bins at the parade site because ""we are slightly concerned paradegoers will not want to part with their newfound treasure on the day of the event,"" said Alita Kane, recycling coordinator for Tampa. Instead, they'll focus on collecting the beads after people bring them home.

https://www.ecowatch.com/denver-green-roofs-2508372741.html,['Denver'],Denver Becomes Latest City to Require Green Roofs,"Denver is the latest city to mandate rooftop gardens or solar installations on new, large buildings, joining San Francisco, New York, Paris, London and other cities around the world with similar green roof measures, the Associated Press reported.

The Colorado capital ranks third in the nation for highest heat island and eighth in the nation for worst ozone/particulate pollution, according to the Denver Green Roof Initiative, a grassroots group that advocated for the city's green roof ordinance, Initiative 300.



Although the official tally is not in, the ballot initiative had 54 percent approval as of Thursday, signaling that the measure is headed towards victory. The vote will be certified on Nov. 24.

Initiative 300 creates a new building code that requires green roofs or solar panels for most buildings 25,000 square feet or larger that are constructed after Jan. 1, 2018.

The Associated Press noted that the measure is more stringent than other green roof mandates, as it requires many existing buildings to be retrofitted with green roofs when the old roof wears out. Older buildings that cannot support the load of a green roof can get an exemption.



""These required building improvements would significantly reduce long term operating costs by lowering energy consumption and increasing the longevity of a roof,"" the Denver Green Roof Initiative stated on its campaign website. ""A green roof lasts 2-3 times as long as a traditional roof because the waterproofing membrane is protected from damage by the elements and workers by covering it with a growing medium and plants.""

The measure did not have an easy road to passage. Denver Mayor Michael Hancock opposed the initiative over worries that it could drive up the costs of construction projects. Also, several Denver businesses spent $250,000 in an advertising push against the plan.

Department of Community Planning and Development spokeswoman Andrea Burns told the Denver Post in March that the department would prefer to give architects and engineers ""the flexibility to design a roofing system that works best for their needs and their budgets.""

Following the vote, however, Burns conceded to CBS4 that ""it will be a little bit of work in the next few weeks, but green roofs are already possible in Denver. It's just a matter of making those agreements that are part of Initiative 300 work with our system now. We're going to make this work for the people of Denver.""

The Denver Green Roof Initiative admits that green roofs cost about $15 more per square feet than a traditional black roof but pointed out that the green roof will pay for itself in about six years.



""Even though the extra cost would be offset in as soon as 6.2 years, most developers choose not to incorporate them because they build the building then sell it,"" the group said. ""They don't see those energy and storm-water savings. They don't save the money from roof longevity. Yet they are still able to sell the building for more money with these improvements!! We believe that the developers of Denver could be doing more to negate their footprint in our beautiful city. We believe green roofs are the answer.""

The initiative was endorsed by several green builders and environmental groups.

""Initiative I-300 will contribute to improving Denver's air quality, increasing the energy efficiency of its buildings, mitigating the urban heat island effect, managing storm water runoff, and creating habitat for pollinators and other insects,"" said Lauren Petrie, Food & Water Watch's Rocky Mountain Region Director. ""We are dedicated to a more sustainable future in Denver and believe that passing this green roof initiative will be a vehicle for asserting our human desire for cleaner air and water, and cooler urban temperatures.

The Denver Green Roof Initiative stressed in a Facebook post Friday that even though Initiative 300 passed, there are still ""tremendous hurdles to overcome due to push back from those in power.""



""This is a battle won against climate but the war doesn't stop here,"" the post stated. ""We must all get active and fight for our values, because we are stronger together. Thanks again for the overwhelming support. The citizens of Denver have a healthier, more sustainable future because of YOU!""

Here’s how this hackathon is working on them from the start,"Baltimore faces challenges that didn’t appear overnight, and as a result are deep-rooted. So, as is often on view around the city’s tech and entrepreneurship community (as recently as Tuesday night at Johns Hopkins’ Social Innovation Lab’s Impact and Innovation Forum), solving them will require resolve to think systemically and create solutions with a different approach than what’s been taken before.

As if to underscore this point, news broke while I was writing this piece that Catherine Pugh resigned as mayor of Baltimore as she faces multiple investigations related to payments she received for a children’s book series called “Healthy Holly.”

It’s an important moment in the city’s history, and difficult to ignore even for a niche publication such as ours. The scandal that’s engulfed Pugh in the weeks since the Baltimore Sun broke the story that she received $500,000 through a no-bid contract with the University of Maryland Medical System while she sat on that organization’s board shows the need for change on multiple levels.

But in that time, as Baltimore has been in the first days of what will now be an extended tenure under now-former City Council President Bernard C. “Jack” Young, there have also been reminders — albeit on a smaller scale — that the work of the city continues.

As a reporter covering a part of the city’s work that involves the people who seem removed from the political apparatus, those reminders come often to me. Just today, for instance, we covered an announcement that the city has a new emergency alert system.

The work to create lasting solutions also continues. On Wednesday in one of the few buildings amid the wooded area in Cylburn Arboretum, more than 50 people gathered to begin developing the ideas that will be part of the solutions built at Hack Baltimore. Looking out over the trees, it felt appropriately removed from City Hall, even as attendees tackled the challenges that the city government is charged with addressing.

Bringing together organizers of multiple short-duration, tech-constructing events, Hack Baltimore is planned as a citywide tech planning for a citywide hackathon in 2020 that will build solutions in six areas.

Delali Dzirasa, the technologist and founder of Fearless who is the chair for the event and leads along with an organizing committee, said they’re looking to take an approach that ensures projects that are built will be used as solutions by the people they’re designed to help. While hackathons produce plenty of interesting technology and new approaches to solving problems, the fact that they usually take place on weekends can also make them temporary.

So by doing lots of work ahead of time, Hack Baltimore’s organizing team is looking to ensure that the civic leaders who use the solution are getting something they need, and are involved in the process of developing it.

The first step in that process is identifying the challenges and the ideas to help solve them. That’s where the design jam comes in. Dzirasa said the group focused on challenges in areas such as housing, transportation, public safety, workforce development, health and education. The problem statements that arose at this and other events will appear on a portal where they can be accessed by all. Ideas will also be curated directly from the public beyond such events. They’ll be refined, and then ultimately an innovative solution will be pitched against the ideas.

Dzirasa stressed that the most important aspect of the effort is to sustain the work. So they’re documenting the work from the start.

“If we’re going to do this, we’re going to document in a public way and post it on the citywide portal, Dzirasa said.” If we stop at first base, someone should be able to take that and go to second base, and then third base.”

Putting them in that space ensures that what has been developed will live on, even if the people who are leading and working on them changes.

https://inlandempire.us/riverside-city-colleges-urban-farm-receives-award/,['Riverside'],Riverside City College’s Urban Farm Receives Award,"Riverside, CA – Riverside City College’s Urban Farm, a model for sustainable urban farming on the RCC campus, received honorable mention honors in the Exemplary Program Award by the California Community Colleges Board of Governors. The award recognizes outstanding California community college programs excelling in environmental stewardship.

Rio Hondo College in Whittier received the Exemplary Program Award for its alternative fuels program, which includes hybrid, fuel cell, compressed natural gas, liquid natural gas, liquid petroleum gas and electric vehicle technologies.

RCC was one of three colleges to receive honorable mention awards. Santa Barbara City College was recognized for its permaculture garden, which has changed the College’s public face by transforming manicured lawns into large portions of grounds covered with sustainable plants that help solve food insecurity among students. Food produced in the garden goes directly to the College food pantry. And, Sierra College received an honorable mention for its environmental studies and sustainability program. The program provides students with the opportunity to meet the requirements to transfer to four-year colleges in the environmental fields including environmental studies and environmental science.

The Exemplary Program Award was established by the Board of Governors in 1991 to recognize outstanding community college programs. As many as two California Community College programs may receive cash awards of $4,000 and up to four programs receive honorable mention plaques. This year’s theme for the Exemplary Program Award was Environmental Responsibility.

The Urban Garden at RCC has been a model for sustainable urban farming on the campus for a number of years. The Farm has attracted college faculty, staff and students, community members, K-12 feeder schools and local universities, particularly the University of California, Riverside, to help develop the Farm and showcase the potential of its approach to community agriculture.

The Farm’s production has increased from 101 pounds of produce per month, to 238 pounds. The produce is distributed to those who are in need. The mission of the Farm is to “make healthy, sustainable food available to the community through education and practice; strive to develop small footprint farm plots by utilizing local materials and considering the local climate and soil conditions; enable the education of RCC students by providing outdoor laboratory space; and support students and community members interested in sustainable gardening methods to contribute to an effective and accessible local food system.”",[]
https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2017/04/20/st-louis-infrastructure-sewer-tunnel-water-system-215056,['St. Louis'],How a Sewer Will Save St. Louis,"Erick Trickey is a writer based in Boston. His last piece in Politico Magazine explored the economic benefits to immigrant communities along the commuter rail line connecting St. Paul and Minneapolis.

ST. LOUIS—Deep down a sunlit shaft, 175 feet under the North Riverfront neighborhood on the city’s far edge, Shayne Peck’s crew is beginning to hack a giant tunnel out of the limestone. Three men hang in the air on lifts, cutting into the rock face at spots marked with red paint. “They’re drilling holes,” says Peck, whose son is one of the drillers, “so we can load ’em with explosives.”

The start of the tunnel, just above the crew and the red-painted limestone, looks like the entrance to a cave in a cliff wall. Future blasts, Peck says, will deepen the tunnel—only 50 feet long now— until it stretches more than half a mile. This is not a tunnel for commuter trains or cars. It’s more of a horizontal well, and when it is complete in 2020, it will capture up to 12 million gallons of sewage-contaminated storm water, keeping it out of the Mississippi River. In effect, it will be a giant septic tank. But it won’t even be the biggest one in St. Louis.

The massive tunnel Peck has just started will soon be dwarfed by its successors. St. Louis is building a gargantuan system, including 28 miles of storage tunnels, to handle the city’s most stomach-churning water pollution problem. About 50 times a year, after major rainstorms, St. Louis’ sewers overflow, and 13 billion gallons of sewage-contaminated storm water escapes into the Mississippi River and its tributaries. It’s an everyday environmental nightmare and a risk to human health. And it’s a common, if largely undiscussed, urban American affliction.

All across the Northeast and Midwest, and in some regions beyond, more than 700 older cities still dump toilet waste into their oceans, lakes and rivers. The nasty problem is built into the cities’ infrastructure, a relic of early 20th-century engineering practices that were considered engineering triumphs in their day. The sewer systems, built decades ago, combine storm water and wastewater in the same pipes. On normal days, those millions of gallons of waste pass through a treatment plant. But after storms, the sewers become overwhelmed and the treatment plants can’t keep up. Instead of allowing the excess water to back up into streets and basements, the solution from decades past was to build overflow valves that divert some of the untreated flow into the nearest waterway. According to an Environmental Protection Agency report, just at the nation’s major beaches—a small portion of the country’s swimming areas—about 3,500 to 5,000 Americans a year get sick because of sewage-contaminated water.

That’s not OK anymore. Under pressure from the federal government, cities have embarked on decades-long projects to cut down on the sewage they spew. Since the 1990s, the EPA has used the Clean Water Act to take legal action against about 200 large and medium-sized cities. For big cities, the cost of compliance runs into the billions of dollars.

St. Louis’ agreement with the EPA, signed in 2012, is the most expensive in the continental U.S. It commits the region to spending $4.7 billion in engineering projects over 23 years to cut down on sewer overflow. As toxic as its effects are on water quality, the cure can be brutal for taxpayers, many of whom might never have been aware of the problem until they learned that their sewer fees would triple or more to pay for the solution. The regional program in St. Louis, called Project Clear, will cost about $3,600 across those 23 years for every man, woman and child in the city and its suburbs.

“Over 20 million people get their drinking water from the Mississippi River, including the city of St. Louis,” says Francis Slay, whose 16-year tenure as St. Louis mayor ended April 18. “So it’s of absolute importance to make sure we have clean water.”

Slay, while aware of the environmental consequences of doing nothing, nevertheless had an obligation to his constituents to soften the impact to their pocketbooks. After the EPA and a local environmental group sued St. Louis’ Metropolitan Sewer District in 2007, Slay, a Democrat, joined the negotiations and argued for a less costly project. “We were fighting for the taxpayers,” he says. “I was looking at cost, rates, timing, trying to do all we can to make it as reasonable as possible. And of course the EPA wanted to do it quicker, and they wanted it to be more expensive to start with—the same thing that was going on in cities across America.”

This cost containment encouraged the city to get creative. Instead of even more tunnels, St. Louis and the EPA agreed to substitute innovative ways of controlling storm water. Project Clear includes $100 million of green infrastructure projects, which give nature and open space the job of soaking up rain before it ever gets to the gutters. The sewer agency is building rain gardens on vacant lots and paying businesses to add water-thirsty minigardens to their developments. Many of the Metropolitan Sewer District’s green projects do more than lighten the burden on the sewers—they also have side effects that help St. Louis’ neighborhoods.

“We can’t just spend the money we’re spending, and solve our problem, and have most of the solutions be underground,” says Brian Hoelscher, the sewer agency’s CEO. “We’re finding every opportunity we can to team with somebody…In a lot of cases, it makes the cost of our program less.”

The MSD is a regional agency that works closely with the city of St. Louis, whose mayor appoints half its board. That cooperation grew even closer on March 23, when the sewer agency began a $13.5 million effort to tear down condemned homes inside St. Louis and replace them with open space. The project will double the number of vacant, blighted homes torn down in St. Louis from 200 a year to 400—a huge help to a city that has lost more than half its population since its peak of 857,000 in 1950. For the neighborhood, each tear-down means one less dangerous eyesore. For the sewer system, each newly empty lot means about 10,000 fewer gallons of storm water coming in per year, which means less tainted overflow spilling out.

But by far the biggest component of the project is the tunnel system, which keeps 30 men occupied more or less full time, and will do so for many years to come. Shayne Peck, 47, a fourth-generation tunneler whose family built coal mines, used to excavate for the Chicago sewers. “I’m open to staying here in St. Louis,” Peck says. “I only need eight more years until I’m retired.”

A quiet waterway meanders through St. Louis’ vast Forest Park, threading past a classical-columned bandstand, under white-railed bridges, past bike paths and through verdant marshes. It might look bucolic but it’s man-made, constructed less than 20 years ago to imitate a real river that disappeared from the park more than a century ago. Near the waterway, in the park’s northeast corner, behind an overlooked gate set in the earth, concrete steps lead underground to reveal what happened to that lost river. Down below, a pair of century-old concrete tunnels, dark and ominous, rise 29 feet high to vaulted ceilings. The sound of flowing water echoes off the walls.

“You’re standing inside a combined sewer,” says Lance LeComb, spokesman for the MSD. “It just happens to be a very large one.”

In one tunnel, brown water flows slowly, carrying a bit of debris now and then. A short weir divides the tunnel from its slightly higher twin, which holds a little trail of standing water. The flowing water, LeComb says, is wastewater coming from the western suburb of University City, four miles away. Across the channel, he points out the opening of a smaller tunnel in the far wall, where storm water from St. Louis’ Union Boulevard empties into the sewer.

This massive tunnel structure is what’s left of the River des Peres here in Forest Park. More than a century ago, the river bent here, turning from east to south on its route to the Mississippi River. But St. Louis, like many older cities, used its rivers and creeks as sewers in the 19th century. In 1904, when St. Louis held the World’s Fair in Forest Park, this stretch of the River des Peres stank so badly that the city enclosed it in a long wooden box. In the 1910s and 1920s, St. Louis banished the foul waterway permanently. The city dug an open-cut trench four miles long, built the twin tunnels inside, then buried them.

The tunnels are an engineering marvel, even now. They were declared a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1988. But even this mammoth structure, St. Louis’ largest combined sewer, can’t handle a heavy rain without overflowing. About a mile south, where the twin tunnels open into daylight, the water they carry falls through two large grates and into other sewers that run straight to the Lemay Wastewater Treatment Plant, the region’s second-largest sewage facility, which can treat up to 340 million gallons of water a day. But after storms, the grates become overwhelmed and the excess storm water and waste water spill into the last 10 miles of the River des Peres. Dozens more overflowing sewers do the same, feeding into the river before it opens into the Mississippi 10 miles south of the iconic Gateway Arch.

“It’s not much of a river anymore,” says LeComb. “It’s what happens to urban rivers in America.”

Cities in 32 states have combined sewers. They’re mostly in the Northeast and the Midwest, where sewers often date from the mid-20th century or earlier. (Cities in the interior West and Southwest, which developed later, tended to build sewers that separate sewage from storm water.) But in those older cities, diluted sewage still overflows into rivers, lakes and oceans after rain. The consequences for public health are serious. Bacteria common in sewage, including salmonella and E. coli, can cause stomach and intestinal illness. Viruses can also lead to fever, skin infections and respiratory illness. Fishermen who eat their catch from polluted rivers are also at risk. Just how much risk depends on the body of water being polluted—how big it is, how fast it moves and how people interact with it. In many Great Lakes cities, signs go up on urban beaches after heavy summer storms, warning visitors that bacteria levels are too high for them to swim. One Cleveland beach had an advisory posted for half of all summer days in 2015.

Since 1994, the EPA has worked its way across the country, roughly from east to west, suing cities’ sewer departments and agencies to force them to clean up. The result has been negotiated settlements (consent decrees overseen by federal judges) with cities such as Atlanta ($1.1 billion in 1998), Washington ($2.6 billion in 2003), Cincinnati ($3.3 billion in 2004), and Cleveland ($3 billion in 2011).

The enormous projects promised in consent decrees have meant big contracts for construction firms—and, sometimes, a chance for the unscrupulous to profiteer. A 1993 consent decree to improve the sewers of Birmingham, Alabama, played a role in a spectacular corruption scandal. It led to multiple bribery convictions of public officials and contractors—and Jefferson County’s 2011 municipal bankruptcy.

In 2015, the EPA declared that it, or state agencies, had addressed overflows in 201 of the nation’s 213 largest combined sewer systems. Only a few big cities have escaped lawsuits, most of them because they confronted their sewer overflows early. Milwaukee started to build tunnels to capture overflows in the 1970s. Philadelphia, which cooperates closely with the EPA, came to a less formal agreement instead of being sued. (New York City has a legal agreement with its state government, not the feds, to curb overflows.)

Homeowners bear the costs of the anti-pollution projects, usually in spiking sewer bills. The EPA considers sewer rates a high burden if they’re more than 2 percent of a region’s median household income—but even then, it wants communities to finish their clean-water projects in 15 to 20 years. So local officials often come to consent decree negotiations seeking to limit how much they’ll have to spend to control overflows and how many years they’ll have to finish.

Those stakes were especially high for the St. Louis region. It has the nation’s fourth-largest sewer system, behind only New York, Los Angeles and Chicago. The city of St. Louis also has a high poverty rate, so sewer bills can take up a big portion of poorer city homeowners’ budgets.

Going into consent-decree negotiations, the sewer agency braced itself for a $6 billion bill and 15 to 17 years to get the work done. That would’ve sent sewer rates soaring, from a low $14 a month for the average single-family house in 2003, and $28 a month in 2011, past $100 a month in the 2020s.

“If they had just charged us more money and wanted to get it done quicker, it would have been devastating,” says Slay, the former mayor. “We have a high level of poverty in the city of St. Louis. What we’re doing now is going to be a heavy burden on households.”

One of the innovative ways St. Louis has figured out to reduce storm water reaching its sewer system is by demolishing derelict homes and leaving the lot vacant. A vacant lot, such as this one on Labadie Street in central St. Louis, can absorb 10,000 gallons of rain water in a year. | Mark Peterson/Redux Pictures for Politico Magazine

Instead, the 2012 consent decree settled on $4.7 billion over 23 years. That included $1.8 billion to reduce combined sewer overflows in the city and some nearby suburbs, mostly by building those 28 miles of storage tunnels. It also includes $2 billion to eliminate sanitary sewer overflows in the outer suburbs—a different challenge that involves keeping storm water out of the separate wastewater system, testing sewer lines for clogs and cleaning them out, building above-ground storage tanks, and disconnecting suburban homes’ downspouts from the sewer system.

The St. Louis consent decree is still the second largest the EPA has negotiated in a sewer case, second only to Honolulu’s $5 billion. St. Louis saved a lot of money by persuading the EPA to let it deal with overflows in half of the city without building interceptor tunnels—by building green infrastructure instead of gray.

The old bungalow’s front-porch roof was splintered and sagging. Its roof tiles were tattered, a gutter was gone and a missing side door or window was replaced by only a thin board. It was just one of thousands of vacant buildings in St. Louis—but on March 23, the mayor, the local alderman, and the head of St. Louis’ sewer agency came out to see an excavator’s claw tear it down.

With that demolition, the sewer agency became a partner in the city’s drive to knock down its most ruined houses. St. Louis has lost more than half its population since the mid-20th century, settling at 318,000 today. When people leave, they leave houses behind. Parts of north St. Louis are peppered with empty houses in various states of decay. “Doll houses,” some St. Louisans call them because a missing wall, ripped away by scavengers, lets you look straight inside.

MSD’s $13.5 million home demolition program will knock down about 200 more houses a year (up from 200) and leave the lots vacant to absorb rainwater. A pilot program showed that the newly vacant lots reduced the load on the sewer system by soaking up more rain. Every acre of impervious surface removed translated into 231,000 gallons less sewer overflow.

Alderman Jeffrey Boyd, whose north St. Louis ward includes some of the city’s most vacant lots, calls it a win-win for the sewer agency and his constituents. “One of the biggest concerns people have in the neighborhood are the vacant buildings,” says Boyd, “that either they’ll fall on someone, or some kid’s going to get snatched up into one.”

St. Louis’ consent agreement with the EPA includes $100 million in green infrastructure projects—changes to the land that keep rain out of the sewer system. It’s one of the largest such commitments in the country. And it’ll transform empty land across St. Louis’ north side.

Like the rain garden on a vacant lot in St. Louis’ Old North neighborhood. Created by MSD, the garden is specially landscaped and engineered to absorb storm water from nearby streets. Even in late March, before it blooms fully, the lot is a subtle landscape of green, red and orange plants. Purple coneflower, sumac and sedges, all native to Missouri, were chosen to appeal to birds and butterflies and to soak up a lot of rain. The land is sculpted into a basin, lower than street level. In the streets around the garden, cuts in the curbs look like gutters—but they flow into the garden instead of underground.

Though the two-century-old Old North neighborhood has suffered from abandonment, it has begun to experience prosperity, too. The Crown Square project, completed in 2010, rehabilitated 27 historic buildings a few blocks down North 14th Street. Development is springing up even closer to the rain garden: new houses in a row two blocks away, some homes with stickers still on their new windows the other direction. Future developers of nearby blocks will benefit from the rain garden taking in some of their property’s storm runoff from their property. “If a new development goes in over there,” says MSD’s LeComb, “that new development won’t have to pay for the same level of storm water control, because it’s already being done by us.”

West of downtown St. Louis, developers have benefited directly from another MSD program, which compensates them if they build green infrastructure. The parking lot of the new Ikea on Forest Park Boulevard is ringed with green gardens full of rain-slurping plants. A new office park on several nearby blocks has little gardens and tree lawns next to the street, soaking in rain from the street.

Across the country, forward-thinking sewer agencies are building green infrastructure and calculating where it’ll do the most good, both for the sewer system and the community. Kansas City, Missouri, which signed a $2.4 billion consent decree in 2010, aims to create $68 million in green infrastructure, much of it in the city’s Marlborough neighborhood, where a nine-acre park with a wetland pond is under construction. DC Water in Washington plans to install permeable pavement in six locations in the District this summer and fall. In the Brightwood neighborhood, it’s already spent $2 million on street trees and little curbside pockets of green space to collect rain water.

Back in St. Louis, the green infrastructure program isn’t the only part of Project Clear that’s changing the city’s landscape. MSD is also spending $230 million on its Cityshed program, which has tackled flooding that burdens the sewer system. In eight low-lying areas, including valleys where creeks once ran, MSD offered to buy the homes of a couple of hundred homeowners whose basements chronically flood. All but a few of them have taken the sewer agency’s offers and moved. LeComb says the agency followed federal guidelines on fair financial offers to relocate homeowners, paying moving expenses and the cost of buying a comparable home elsewhere.

MSD’s clean-water plans split St. Louis in half. The north and east get green infrastructure, while the south and west get old-fashioned gray infrastructure—tunnels and other projects made of concrete and steel. There are two reasons for the split. Sewers in the north and east flow, and overflow, directly to the Mississippi River. Sewers in the south and west head to the River des Peres. Coincidentally, that water divide roughly lines up with St. Louis’ economic and social divides. The north side, home to the city’s predominantly African-American neighborhoods, has suffered for decades from white flight and disinvestment. Today, it’s struggling the most with vacant and abandoned properties. That’s left more room for green space, and more demand for demolition projects.

Boyd, the alderman, says he’s not aware of any opposition to Project Clear’s different approaches for the two sides of town. MSD’s green goals for the north side fit his constituents’ wishes. They responded to the March 23 demolition with enthusiasm. “After a story aired, I got calls: ‘Would you consider [knocking down] a building on my street?’”

Former Mayor Francis Slay (left) and Planning Director Don Roe worked with the Metropolitan Sewer District to choose the locations of its green infrastructure projects, including its home demolitions.

But there are limits to what green infrastructure can do for a city and its sewers. The EPA allowed St. Louis to go all-green to the north because less stringent water-quality standards apply to the Mississippi River. On the south side of town, where sewers overflow into the River des Peres, storage tunnels and other gray infrastructure will slash the overflow volume, currently 6.3 billion gallons a year, by roughly 80 percent. On the north side, the $100 million in green infrastructure will reduce the volume of the sewage-tainted overflows going directly into the Mississippi by 110 million gallons a year—less than 2 percent of the 7 billion gallons that overflow there every year. Since the River des Peres flows into the Mississippi, that means Project Clear will reduce the total overflows into the Mississippi by about 40 percent.

Is it OK to let so much sewage into the Mississippi River? It seems like a shoddy way to treat America’s most legendary waterway, which carried Mark Twain and Huckleberry Finn to exploration and adventure. But the ways Americans have used and altered the Mississippi actually explain the different treatment.

Near St. Louis “we have a very fast-flowing, managed river that’s really constructed for commerce,” says Hoelscher, the sewer agency’s CEO. “We don’t have beaches.” In short, it’s a river that doesn’t need a lot of coddling.

The EPA has several levels of water-quality standards, depending in part on how people use a lake or river. It’s a quarter-mile wide at St. Louis, with a strong current. No one dips into it for a swim—it’s too dangerous. In fact, though St. Louis celebrates its identity as a riverfront city, there aren’t many places where people can visit the river. Industrial uses line its banks north of downtown. Even near the Gateway Arch and in Laclede’s Landing, the historic waterfront neighborhood, tall concrete levees guard against floods. The EPA doesn’t consider the Mississippi a waterway for swimming, though it does require enough pollution controls to protect ""secondary"" recreation, such as boating and fishing. That contributes to its tolerance for continued sewer overflows along its banks. The giant waterway can absorb, dilute, churn and metabolize more pollution than a trickling stream in a drainage channel—such as the River des Peres.

So, despite all the ways green infrastructure can improve and beautify a city, sewer agencies can’t go all-green, because concrete tunnels usually provide more bang for the buck. Which brings us back to the titanic engineering project now underway.

Even where the River des Peres still exists, it’s an unnatural waterway, altered by human design. In the near-west suburbs, just before its plunges into the Forest Park tubes and becomes a sewer line, the river is often bound by concrete. When it re-emerges above ground after the park, it’s a wide, V-shaped drainage canal. A Works Progress Administration project built during the New Deal, the channel replaced the old, natural riverbed. Most days, the broad channel has only a trickle of water in it—a mix of standing rainwater and the remnants of the last storm’s sewer overflows. The only time it really looks like a river is after heavy storms, when water can back up the tributary from the surging Mississippi River. As unsightly as the river is, people come into contact with the River des Peres often. No one swims in it, but a bike path runs along a stretch of it. Houses back up to it. “It’s just an empty big huge ditch,” says Hoelscher, “that birds, ducks and kids like to play in.”

It’s not as bad as it was in the 1980s, when residents often called it the River de Pew because of its stench. In the 1990s and 2000s, even before the EPA came calling, MSD spent $2.3 billion to cut its number of sewer overflow points regionwide from about 700 to about 400. But the River des Peres channel is still a health hazard. A kid playing, or an adult picking up trash, could be exposed to E. coli and other bacteria common in human waste.

So this is where MSD will build most of its tunnels. In 2020, it’ll start Project Clear’s biggest single project, the nine-mile-long, 30-foot-wide, $630 million Lower & Middle River des Peres Storage Tunnel. The behemoth will run under the River des Peres from the Forest Park tubes’ outflow to near the Lemay treatment plant on the Mississippi. It’ll capture up to 206 million gallons of combined sewer overflow after storms. In 2024, MSD plans to start a two-mile tunnel under some River des Peres tributaries. In 2028, it’s agreed to start another 9,000-foot tunnel to capture overflows that now go into the Upper River des Peres in University City. For those projects, tunnel-boring machines, rather than explosives, will handle most of the work.

Once it’s all done, Project Clear is supposed cut the number of overflows a year into the River des Peres from about 50 to about four. The total volume of overflows should fall 80 percent, to about 1.2 billion gallons a year. It’s not perfect, but no city’s combined-sewer project is. The rule of thumb in overflow control and tunnel-building is that the costs escalate fast the farther you push toward zero and try to contain the flow from the very heaviest storms.

And, unfortunately, the price will keep spiking for St. Louis homeowners. Average sewer rates will hit $44 per month this year, $61 a month in 2020, and possibly as much as $90 a month in the mid-2020s. “We’re trying to find how to lower the next set of rates,” says Hoelscher. Smart financing helps some. In 2016, area voters approved the sale of bonds to fund Project Clear. MSD is also the biggest user of the state of Missouri’s revolving loan fund.

The consent decree will set MSD’s priorities until 2035. The proposed cuts to the EPA in the Trump administration’s proposed fiscal year 2018 budget will affect St. Louis only indirectly, if at all. The proposal includes a 37 percent cut to the EPA’s civil enforcement division, which takes local governments and businesses to court, and a 12 percent cut in compliance monitoring. “It’s going to cripple the ability of EPA to move forward with more enforcement on CSOs,” warns Amanda Waters, general counsel of the National Association of Clean Water Agencies. Cuts like that could slow the EPA’s efforts to get the last few major holdout cities under combined-sewer consent decrees.

Once a consent decree is signed, it’s hard to change—as the Trump administration is discovering in the realm of police reform. A federal judge recently approved Baltimore’s police consent decree, negotiated by the Obama administration, despite the Trump administration’s attempt to delay it. Likewise, even an EPA less friendly to regulation can’t change existing clean-water decrees easily. “A judge has the responsibility to oversee that decree for the life of it,” Waters says. “You’d have to go back to the judge, and explain why [changing it is the] right thing.”

But a weaker EPA could make it harder to cities like St. Louis to renegotiate their decrees to fit changing technologies—for example, to substitute more green infrastructure for gray. “This is the part that concerns me the most about these cuts,” says Waters, “for our existing members who need to be able to adapt their decrees to match the times.”",[]
https://lasvegassun.com/news/2019/sep/03/county-sales-tax-for-water-projects-is-extended-in/,['Las Vegas'],County sales tax for water projects is extended indefinitely,"County sales tax for water projects is extended indefinitely

A quarter-cent sales tax raising $100 million annually for water and wastewater projects will remain in place indefinitely following a decision Tuesday by the Clark County Commission.

The tax, which was approved by voters by a significant margin in 1998, has raised more than $1.4 billion over the last two decades. The 6-1 vote removes a sunset clause that would have made the tax expire in 2025. Officials from the Southern Nevada Water Authority, Clark County Water Reclamation District and other water and wastewater agencies say the tax has been vital in funding reliable water systems.

Proceeds from the tax have been put toward things like funding new treatment facilities, funding the debt service of North Las Vegas’ water reclamation facility and debt service for a waterline connecting Boulder City to the River Mountains Water Treatment Plant.

John Restrepo, an independent economist with RCG Economics, said maintaining the sales tax is important for maintaining a stable revenue source for Southern Nevada’s water and wastewater facilities.

“The tax base in Nevada is somewhat limited and not as broad-based as we’d like it to be,” he said. “From an economic and water security standpoint, it makes sense to keep this important piece of the pie.”

But some critics, like resident Ed Uehling, said the tax is “regressive” and that it “spits in the face of low-income people.”

Uehling added that SNWA operates like a business taking money away from the public.

“This agency has a product to sell and can easily create a lot more money by acting like a business instead of what’s being presented,” he said.

Commissioner Tick Segerblom was the sole naysayer on the vote. He also felt the tax was a regressive one.

“At the end of the day, we’re basically subsidizing water rates,” Segerblom said. “That’s $100 million a year that, looking forward, there’s a lot of other things we could be doing with that $100 million besides water.”

Commissioner Jim Gibson addressed these criticisms in a motion to approve the tax.

“If anyone looks at the history of the legislative work that has been done over decades, we have narrowed the tax base, exempted so many things, all designed to lift some of the burden as much as possible,” he said.",[]

an agreement

for how pollution levels will be tested.

The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality, which raised concerns about the agreement in October, says the plans will deliver some but not all of the data needed to track and clean up widespread contamination of a 10-mile stretch of the Willamette River.

Four of the companies responsible for cleaning up contamination at the site took the lead in negotiating the agreement: Schnitzer Steel, Evraz, The Marine Group and Arkema.

Until today, those names were being kept confidential. They represent a fraction of more than 150 public and private parties responsible for paying for the cleanup.

""This work will expedite the cost-effective cleanup of the site in a way that is protective of public health and the environment, while ensuring that this waterway that is so vital to Oregon’s economy continues to be a working harbor,"" Schnitzel Steel and The Marine Group said in a joint statement.

The four companies are part of larger group of about 65 private firms involved in the cleanup. Together, they are calling themselves the PCI Private Business Group. The group released a statement supporting the pollution testing plan and has agreed to help pay the $14 million price tag.

The new agreement outlines how the entire Portland Harbor site will be tested for pollutants. It includes testing river sediment, surface water and fish tissue for contaminants such as carcinogenic polychlorinated biphenyls or PCBs.

The resulting map of pollution at the site will help pinpoint exactly how much cleanup action will be needed to meet the EPA's cleanup targets. Cleaning up the site will involve dredging the river to remove contaminated soil and covering contaminated areas with clean soil, among other actions.

Findings from the pollution sampling will also be used to determine which parties will pay for what portion of the massive $1 billion cleanup.

The new plan is a key step in the Portland Harbor cleanup process.

EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt released a statement saying he's proud of the progress the agency has made since releasing a final cleanup plan for the Portland Harbor site early this year.

THANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor

""We are committed to keeping up the momentum,” Pruitt said. “By cooperating with the state, the tribal nations, other federal partners and the responsible parties, we will keep the cleanup moving toward our shared goals of reducing risks to people and the environment, and returning the Lower Willamette to a healthier and more vital working waterway for all.”

The EPA recently announced that Portland Harbor is one of 21 priority Superfund sites across the country targeted for ""immediate and intense attention."" The Northwest's other priority-listed Superfund site is a former creosote operation on the shore of Lake Washington in Renton, Washington.

EPA Superfund Task Force Chair visited Portland last week to help explain what that means, though many community groups and public agencies still had questions after he left.

Officials say updated pollution testing is needed because contamination levels may have changed as the site has slowly made its way through the Superfund cleanup planning process over the past 16 years.

In October, the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality raised concerns that the state and tribes were left out of the agreement negotiations and that the pollution sampling plan would ultimately weaken and delay the cleanup.

Comments from the state and tribal groups were subsequently incorporated into the agreement, but according to DEQ project manager Sarah Greenfield the state still sees gaps in the final pollution sampling plan.

""DEQ thinks we are getting a lot of data that we need, but we’re not getting all the data,"" Greenfield said.

The final plan includes sampling smallmouth bass for contamination but it doesn't plan on sampling other fish species such as carp. The plan includes tracking contaminated sediment as it moves through the Superfund site, Greenfield said, but the state would like to see more of those tracking devices throughout the site.

The state is hoping the EPA will find groups that would be willing to pay for collecting this additional information.

""We’ve reiterated this a few times,"" Greenfield said. ""Currently, I don’t think there are any parties planning to step forward. We’re just imploring EPA to seek those parties out. Ideally, we would have gotten it all in one package, but there’s only so much you can get out of one group.""

Bob Sallinger of the Portland Audubon Society said the four companies involved in negotiating the agreement tried to use the process to ""gut"" the EPA's cleanup plan, and they wound up reducing the amount of pollution sampling the EPA was planning to do.

""It is deeply troubling that four companies were allowed to go behind closed doors and in secrecy negotiate a critical piece of the cleanup process with no public input or involvement,"" he said. ""Polluters have the inside line at the EPA and the public is being shut out.""

He said reducing the pollution sampling in wildlife species will make it hard to know whether the cleanup is working to meet the EPA's targets for how clean the river is supposed to be.

A statement from Schnitzer Steel and The Marine Group says the group of companies that negotiated the agreement was formed in response to a request from the EPA, and that the group ""has worked closely with the EPA to finalize the plan.""

EPA spokeswoman Suzanne Skadowski said the agency always keeps the negotiations between the EPA and liable parties confidential and doesn't take public comments on the resulting agreements. However, she said the agreement finalized Tuesday was not necessarily the only agreement the EPA will make for pollution testing at Portland Harbor.

According to the agreement, pollution sampling will be coordinated by two contractors, AECOM and Geosyntec, with a goal of wrapping up in the fall of 2019.",[]
https://sanantonioreport.org/high-ozone-air-pollution-levels-expected-to-hit-san-antonio-this-week/,['San Antonio'],High Ozone Air Pollution Levels Expected To Hit San Antonio This Week,"Levels of ozone pollution in San Antonio are expected to spike to harmful levels and remain that way for the rest of the week, according to air quality forecasts.



The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality has declared ozone action days in San Antonio for Wednesday and Thursday, largely because of regional weather patterns. The state agency is predicting that pollution will stay at levels considered “unhealthy for sensitive groups” through Saturday.



Ozone forms when air pollution from power plants, industrial sites, and vehicle exhaust reacts with volatile chemicals from sources like gasoline and paint in the presence of sunlight. The pollutant has been tied to chronic lung conditions such as asthma, and high enough levels can cause severe symptoms.

The poor air quality comes on the heels of a cold front that’s bringing cooler-than-average summer temperatures to much of Texas, which should, in theory, promote better air quality, not worse. But local conditions and regional wind patterns actually are making higher ozone levels more likely, Brian McGovern, a TCEQ spokesperson, explained in an email.



For San Antonio, high temperatures are likely to remain in the 90s, “which is plenty warm enough to contribute to efficient ozone production,” McGovern said. After the cold front departs, a ridge of high pressure is expected to remain over Texas that will result in sinking air, light to moderate winds, and clear skies, “all of which are conducive for ozone formation,” he said.



McGovern said that some of this ozone will be blowing in from elsewhere.



“Continental air from the central and southern plains is expected to filter in behind the cold front,” he continued. “This area had been experiencing high pressure, light winds, and hot temperatures, all of which contribute to the elevated ozone background levels that are now being transported into Texas.”

Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Austin, and El Paso also are expected to have high ozone levels this week, according to the TCEQ.



San Antonio’s ozone issues have drawn more attention recently after the EPA last July declared the city’s long-term ozone levels too high to meet federal health standards. The designation has brought stricter state and federal scrutiny on San Antonio’s air quality, though so far it has not brought the kind of onerous regulations that some have feared.



This week’s high ozone levels could hamper the region’s ability to meet specific clean air standards by the December 2020 deadline, which would place more stringent regulations on business and transportation planners.

However, those who will feel the most immediate effects of this week’s ozone spike will be “children and especially children with respiratory conditions; the elderly and adults with lung diseases,” said Adelita Cantu, an associate professor of nursing at UT Health San Antonio.



“The impact of breathing ground-level ozone for a number of days includes chest pain, coughing, sore throat, [and] airway inflammation,” Cantu said in an email. “Longterm, it could result in lung damage. And most importantly, it can exacerbate existing health problems asthma, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and cardiac issues, particularly for people that work outdoors.”



Cantu said avoiding ozone impact means staying indoors and limiting outside activity.



“For students, this may increase school absences,” she said. “For all age groups, this may increase visits to providers and emergency rooms and hospital admissions.

“It is important that our policymakers understand that ground-level ozone is what we call an ‘upstream issue’ that ‘downstream’ causes many health problems for all ages. If we can focus more on the curbing the upstream issue, we will have more success downstream.”



Since the EPA’s designation last year, San Antonio’s Metropolitan Health District has taken the local lead on addressing ozone problems.

Ricardo Ambriz, a senior management analyst for Metro Health, said all residents can help keep ozone levels lower this week by changing their driving and fueling behaviors to keep more ozone-forming emissions out of the air.



First, reduce the amount of time vehicles are idling, Ambriz said in an email.



“Idle reduction can take many forms, such as walking into restaurants instead of using the drive-through,” he said. “This can also mean more efficient planning when running errands or better still, postponing unnecessary errands to a future date. People should also consider mass transit options like using the VIA bus system or car- or van-pooling.”



Second, wait to refuel until after 6 p.m., when the sun begins to sink.

“Everyone can help limit the amount of gasoline vapors reacting with sunlight by filling up near sunset or by waiting until after an ozone action day to fill up,” Ambriz said.

Ambriz said that Metro Health also is engaging in several programs aimed at lowering Bexar County’s overall ozone levels. These include working with a team at Bexar County’s Public Works Department to encourage construction workers to idle their equipment less.



Metro Health also is trying to encourage businesses to help reduce emissions by getting their employees to drive and idle less, he said.",[]
http://blogs.edf.org/energyexchange/2018/10/25/sacramento-leads-by-example-on-cleaner-energy-with-help-from-electrification/,['Sacramento'],Sacramento leads by example on cleaner energy with help from electrification,"Good news for California’s clean energy fans. Last week the Board of Directors of the Sacramento Municipal Utility District (SMUD) approved an aggressive new plan that will help push California’s capitol city and its surrounding area closer to meeting, and beating, the state’s deep carbon reduction goals. Once implemented, SMUD will help create a cleaner energy and transportation system for the region.

The importance of SMUDs proposed investment shouldn’t be understated, nor should its impact. Between now and 2040, the utility plans to invest nearly $7 billion toward projects that generate renewable energy and help switch consumers’ energy use away from fossil fuels like natural gas and gasoline. This powerful commitment goes above and beyond the greenhouse gas reforms required by the state, and will enable the region to be net zero for climate pollution in a little more than 20 years.

A move towards electrification

Sacramento’s commitment to cut climate pollution from its energy system is certainly worth celebrating, and it’s also an opportunity to demonstrate how the transition toward electrification can help rethink energy use in other parts of the state and country as well. In recent years new technologies have entered the market that make it cheaper and more efficient for consumers to do things like replace gas-powered water and space heaters with heating technology that can run on wind and solar power. Under new California laws like AB 3232 (Friedman) the California Energy Commission (CEC) and is now examining the potential to reduce climate pollution from residences and commercial buildings through strategies like electrification – meaning SMUD’s going to be helping Sacramento, and California, learn while it is also leading by example.

Why is SMUD going big on shifting local consumers to electricity? Electrification initiatives like this are critical to helping communities decrease their demand for fossil fuels in everyday life – in both buildings where we work and live and in the transportation choices we make. And, based on scenarios run by the CEC, they are an integral part of meeting deep carbon reduction goals between now and 2050.

Through electrification, utilities like SMUD can not only bring more renewable-powered heating technologies to the consumers, they can cut local greenhouse gases and improve air quality. The SMUD plan, for example, helps reduce a projected 65% of local GHG emissions. When evaluated in the context of natural gas’ linkage to emissions of methane due to gas system malfunctions and leaks, (methane is a potent greenhouse gas responsible for about 25 percent of current global warming), actions like SMUD’s become even more urgent because they integrate solutions that decrease overall use of gas.

Finding value in energy data

Adoption of SMUD’s newest investment plan is a smart move at the right time. Electric-powered technologies have never been more affordable, and the Big Data movement has paved the way for smart appliances and vehicles that can communicate directly with the energy grid – essentially allowing users to capitalize their energy usage at times when it is at its cheapest and cleanest. Therefore, this tech is critical not only for keeping electricity rates low and helping integrate more renewable energy into the grid, but also for curbing emissions associated with electric generation and use at the same time. SMUD has a major opportunity to capitalize on this trend by making energy data more transparent and available in order to help customers keep their rates low.

This investment by Sacramento’s public utility, SMUD, reflects a growing consensus among the public and the science community that we need to do more to minimize the climate impacts of our energy and transportation systems. All utilities will be exploring options to meet California’s ambitious and necessary climate goals, and as a result they should be looking to examples of visionary companies making sound investment choices. SMUD’s plan certainly fits that bill and presents another milestone for California on its march toward carbon neutrality.",[]
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/08/30/business/energy-environment/orlando-carbon-climate.html,['Orlando'],From Rooftops to Algae Pools: Orlando’s Vision for Carbon-Free Energy,"ORLANDO, Fla. — This city has long been a leading tourist destination. Now, it is vying for another distinction: to be a pioneer in weaning itself from carbon-based energy.

You can see its aspirations in the thousands of ponds all over the city that collect the runoff from Central Florida’s frequent downpours. Floating solar panels rise and fall in the water, sending power to the grid.

There is also evidence along city streets, where solar panels sit atop streetlights to power them instead of using the electric grid. About 18,000 of the 25,000 in the city already have been converted to high-efficiency light-emitting diodes.

Even algae pools may play a role. That’s where officials are testing a system to trap the carbon that the city emits from power plants or transportation, rather than release it into the atmosphere.",[]

By the year 2050, Orlando commissioners want all the electricity used in the city to come from renewable sources of energy like solar and wind power.In a unanimous vote Tuesday, the Orlando City Council agreed to adopt this goal , joining San Diego, Salt Lake City and 37 other cities across the U.S. that have adopted a 100 percent clean-energy target. Orlando is the largest city in Florida committing to this goal so far, according to the Sierra Club , with St. Petersburg and Sarasota right behind. Aside from combating climate change and pollution, the city argues the move toward renewable energy increases economic opportunities in Central Florida by creating local jobs in the industry. Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer didn't call out the climate change aversion of President Donald Trump or the Republican-led Florida Legislature by name, but did say city mayors had to lead the fight against rising seas and increasing temperatures.""This administration has decided not to honor our commitment to the Paris climate accord, but a lot of mayors around the country have picked up the reins to say if we're not doing it at the federal level, it's incumbent that we lead at the local level,"" Dyer says. ""More than 50 percent of the world's population now lives in cities, so we have to be the ones that are leading on the important issues that are of consequence for not just this year, but for decades and even centuries to come.""Chris Castro, director of sustainability for the city, says over the last decade, Orlando has been trying to move the needle through its Green Works Orlando initiative to become one of the most sustainable cities in the Southeast. The city has already committed to reducing 90 percent of its air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions by 2040 in accord with the Paris Climate Agreement. To achieve this, Orlando has already set a goal of powering 100 percent of municipal operations using renewable energy by 2030. Last year, the U.S. Department of Energy and the Solar Foundation declared Orlando a ""SolSmart City"" for its leadership on expanding clean energy sources.""The power from the sun is cheaper to produce electricity than the power from fossil fuels, including coal and even natural gas,"" Castro says. ""What we want to do is maintain the affordability of our electricity rates. A lot of people think that just by going solar, it's going to be more expensive, and that is not the case. We're actually going to be able to levelize our cost of power over decades, and we'll be able to maintain the affordability and the reliability of our power here in the City of Orlando.""The council is also particularly interested in the potential employment opportunities created by having this commitment to clean energy. Castro says last year in Florida, solar jobs grew 10 times faster than the overall state economy, adding 1,700 new jobs. Commissioner Sam Ings proposed moving the citywide goal of 100 percent renewable energy to 2035, and Castro said that target could be updated as more technology comes along.The resolution was applauded by members of the First 50 Coalition, a broad alliance pushing for local sustainability issues that includes the League of Women Voters of Orange County, the Sierra Club and FL SUN.""I see this vote as historic and a first step toward what we can do in leadership on the national stage,"" says Sara Isaac, director of partnerships for the League. ""I think that you are sending a signal across the nation of the kind of city Orlando wants to be.""In a statement, Phil Compton from the Sierra Club’s Ready for 100 Campaign in Florida also praised the decision by Orlando commissioners.""All across our state and our nation, cities are committing to a future powered by 100 percent clean and renewable energy for all,"" Compton says. ""Today, Orlando joins this growing movement of cities that are ready for 100 percent clean, renewable energy.""",[]

The plan stands out in a state that in recent years has been more inclined to roll back clean energy rules than strengthen them, and in a territory served by FirstEnergy, which has been a leading burner of fossil fuels.

City officials announced the 100 percent renewable power target Thursday as they released an update to Cleveland's climate action plan, which aims to reduce greenhouses gases to 80 percent below the 2010 level by 2050.

Sign up for InsideClimate News Weekly Our stories. Your inbox. Every weekend.

The plan discusses cutting emissions through improvements in energy efficiency and building design; developing more renewable energy within the city and region, including offshore wind power in Lake Erie; and increasing the use of public transportation and access to electric vehicle charging to reduce fossil fuel use.

It sets a 2050 deadline for getting to 100 percent renewable electricity. But there are no details about how the city will work with its local utilities to implement the plan, an omission that raised concerns among some environmental advocates.

Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson said in a letter introducing the report that local leadership on climate is needed more than ever since President Trump announced he was pulling the U.S. out of the Paris climate agreement.

""This plan is about much more than climate change,"" Jackson said. ""Implementing the actions in this plan will create a more sustainable Cleveland. By strengthening our economy, cleaning our environment, and improving the health and wellness of Clevelanders, we are building a thriving green city on a blue lake.""

Transforming a Former Industrial Stronghold

Cleveland is where John D. Rockefeller and a partner incorporated Standard Oil in 1870, and where steel production and other heavy industry formed the city's economic backbone for decades. Heavy industry also took a heavy toll on the city, with pollution that became so problematic it led to a notorious 1969 fire on the Cuyahoga River.

With the decline of heavy industry, Cleveland's population fell. Now, city leaders hope to make clean energy one its drivers of economic growth.

""The business case for energy efficiency and green buildings is strong,"" the plan says. ""They have lower utility and maintenance costs, less risk from energy price volatility, increase property values, improve health and productivity of occupants, create local jobs, and much more."" It also highlights renewable energy jobs, including in manufacturing of wind turbines and battery storage.

Cleveland released its first climate plan in 2013. The latest version talks about the health and property damage risks to the region, citing Environmental Protection Agency data showing more frequent heat waves, heavy downpours occuring twice as often as they did a century ago, and annual temperatures in the Midwest on pace to rise 3 degrees Fahrenheit over the next few decades. To help combat climate change, the report calls for a 40 percent reduction in city emissions compared to 2010 levels by 2030 and 80 percent by 2050.

The city has a long way to go, however. In 2016, emissions were down only 2 percent from 2010, the report says.

Will Utilities Go Along with the Plan?

The goals are laudable but the deadline is not ambitious enough, said Sandy Buchanan, the Cleveland-based executive director of the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, a nonprofit clean-energy research group.

""They seem out of step with advancements in the global electricity market"" which would allow for a more rapid transition, she said.

Also, she notes that there are almost no details about how the 100 percent renewable energy pledge will be met. She would like to see specifics about how the city's two main utilities, FirstEnergy and Cleveland Public Power, would adjust their practices to make it possible for the Cleveland to meet the goals.

The city government controls Cleveland Public Power, but not FirstEnergy. Mark Durbin, a FirstEnergy spokesman, said his company was not part of the discussions that led to Cleveland's commitment.

Ohio's Shifting Views on Clean Energy

Ohio's state government has had an on again, off again relationship with renewable energy. The state took a big step forward on clean energy with a 2008 law that set requirements for renewable energy and energy efficiency, but the state has taken steps backwards since then with a weakening of the clean-energy standards and new restrictions on where wind turbines can be placed.

In the absence of state action, clean-energy advocates have been focusing on Ohio's cities, such as Cincinnati and Columbus.

Columbus ""is considering the feasibility of several pathways to get to 100 percent electricity from renewable sources,"" said Robin Davis, spokeswoman for Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther. She said it's possible a goal of 100 percent renewable energy could be folded into its planning underway on a climate plan.

Cleveland now joins a list of 82 U.S. cities that have made pledges to get to 100 percent renewable energy, according to the Sierra Club's Ready for 100 campaign.",[]
https://www.publicsource.org/pittsburgh-is-no-longer-a-smoky-city-but-that-doesnt-mean-it-has-cleaned-up-its-act/,['Pittsburgh'],"Pittsburgh is no longer a smoky city, but that doesn’t mean it has cleaned up its act - PublicSource","In its bid to host Amazon’s second headquarters, Pittsburgh’s weakest attribute may be its sustainability.

“Amazon has made a commitment to use 100 percent renewable energy in all of its operations,” says Jim Spencer, CEO of EverPower, a windpower company based in Pittsburgh. But when he was asked by the city to provide prices for wind energy, Spencer says he was told that Pittsburgh was not going to offer 100 percent renewable energy.

Why couldn’t Pittsburgh — in this defining moment — pitch a sustainability plan that falls in line with Amazon’s aspirations?

This story was produced in partnership with Pittsburgh Magazine.

Last summer, a few months before the city submitted its Amazon bid, Mayor Bill Peduto committed the city to 100 percent renewable energy by 2035 in support of the Paris Agreement on climate change and in defiance of President Donald Trump. But when Peduto spoke at a clean building conference in April, the tone seemed different. He asked the audience to raise their hands if it was their first time to Pittsburgh. “Keep your hands up if you were expecting old rusty steel mills,” he said. “The rest of you are lying. The nice thing about Pittsburgh, there are not great expectations.”

This is the paradox of Pittsburgh’s current environmental identity: The city is claiming the role of environmental leader but still touts its success relative to its dirty past.

Amazon may not care about how much greener the city is than it used to be. It wants a green city, full stop.

So how green is Pittsburgh?

Getting beyond the past

The deficits of its past remain daunting — with billions of dollars needed to continue remediating overflowing sewers, lead pipes, brownfield contamination and more. The air quality still ranks among the nation’s worst near industrial polluters, such as the Clairton Coke Works, which was fined $1 million by the Allegheny County Health Department this summer for ongoing violations in the air quality agreement. But, overall, the air quality continues to improve, and planned upgrades to the sewer system over the next decade should make the rivers cleaner than they’ve been in generations.

Yet part of what it means to be a green city today is distinct from cleaning up the pollution of the past.

The biggest environmental challenge of the present is climate change, according to scientists at the United Nations and the only way to address it is for people to stop producing so many greenhouse gas emissions. Major cities such as New York and Washington, D.C., have reduced their greenhouse gas emissions by 15 and 23 percent since 2005-2006, and even cities with fewer resources, such as St. Louis and San Diego, have seen their emissions drop.

There isn't a consistent time period all cities are using to measure their greenhouse gas emissions. During the only period measured in Pittsburgh, 2003 to 2013, carbon emissions increased by about 10 percent, despite efforts to curb them.

Alissa Burger, a senior policy adviser with the Pennsylvania Environmental Council, says the city needs to start comparing itself to Seattle and Boston, not its industrial counterparts of the past. “It is going to get us further than comparing us to Cleveland,” she says. “Just because they are our rival in football doesn’t mean they are a rival when it comes to decarbonization.”

Pittsburgh can’t escape its geography or its past — an urban center in a region rich with coal and, more recently, discovered to be sitting in one of the largest natural gas plays in the world.

As time goes on, though, cities like Pittsburgh will not only continue to be judged by environmentalists, corporations and potential residents alike on traditional measures of pollution but also on how green its energy is. Many climate scientists believe everything that runs on fossil fuels, like cars, needs to eventually run on electricity. And the electricity itself needs to become much cleaner. This could be a significant opportunity to grow a green energy industry.

“Just because they are our rival in football doesn’t mean they are a rival when it comes to decarbonization.”

Leaders in Pittsburgh often cite the more than 8,000 clean energy jobs already here. But many of those jobs are not full time or are not truly new. The definition of a green job is any job where more than 0 percent of the work has a green component. The latest data suggests Allegheny County added 4,000 additional clean energy jobs last year but it’s not clear if these are new jobs or old jobs that have incorporated a component of clean energy work.

The job numbers are slightly misleading. The report labels any job with even just a day’s worth of green energy work as a green energy job. This could include an energy salesman who sells mostly ordinary energy policies but has renewable offerings, or a roofer who spends some time installing solar panels but is usually installing traditional roofs.

For example: When considering only those jobs where at least half of the day’s work involves green energy, the number of solar jobs decreases by about a third in Pennsylvania and the nation at large. Even fewer workers spend 100 percent of their day working in solar.

Most of those green energy jobs are construction jobs, according to Philip Jordan, vice president of BW Research Partnership, whose company performed the research. And, according to Jordan, Pennsylvania is actually slightly below average at creating green energy jobs.

If the city does have an advantage, some experts think it could lie in turning one of its biggest deficits — its old buildings — into its most powerful resource. About 80 percent of the city’s climate emissions come from the poor energy-efficiency of its buildings.

The city has already taken steps in a major energy efficiency initiative and, with more investment, could become a leader in the country’s push for energy efficiency. Some local experts think that developing and installing more efficient lighting, better insulation and other tighter building standards could be the area’s best hope for a green future.

Two years ago, Grant Ervin, chief resilience officer for the City of Pittsburgh, began planning for how the city would respond to climate change. He says he repeatedly heard two major fears: One was about the closure of the Beaver Valley nuclear plant because of how much greenhouse gas-free energy it provided. The other concern was over a substantial increase in industrial production, such as what is expected to come from Shell's new Beaver County ethane cracker plant and others still to come.

Now, both worst-case scenarios appear to be imminent.

Renewable energy

Jane Miller and her husband, Mike Kissel, had a leak in the roof of their Edgewood home last year. Instead of a simple patch, the couple installed a new metal roof this year and then hired local solar company, EIS Solar, to install 15 solar panels. It’s enough to provide about 70 percent of the home’s electricity over the course of the year.

The Millers’ $20,000 investment in solar panels is just the sort of commitment that the city needs from its residents, landlords and business owners. Most people can’t afford to drastically reduce their carbon footprint immediately, so as big expenses come up, the city needs people to start replacing their cars and furnaces with greener choices.

The Millers’ solar panels would’ve cost three times as much and provided a third less electricity back in 2009, when EIS Solar was just starting out. Now, the Millers can expect their investment to pay for itself in about a decade.

How green energy should look in Pittsburgh isn’t clear yet, though. Should it come from a solar farm in North Carolina (where about half of Pennsylvania’s solar comes from) or on roofs in the city’s own backyards? Maybe it should be solar and wind or some other mix.

In 2009, President Barack Obama heralded Pittsburgh as a center of “green technology” and, at the time, there was much to be excited about. Pennsylvania was heavily subsidizing solar energy and the installation of solar panels spiked.

The subsidies ended a few years later, and many of the solar companies left or went bankrupt. It’s not only solar energy that has stagnated.

In 2004, the state set a 2021 goal that 8 percent of its energy would come from renewables. It seemed ambitious then. The state is already buying 6.5 percent renewable energy, and there is more than enough wind energy available to meet the 8 percent goal now. So only one new wind farm has been built in Pennsylvania since 2012. Without raising the bar, progress has stalled.

Solar and wind energy make up less than 8 percent of the nation’s electricity but they have been growing 10 times as fast as fossil fuels since 2000.

Pennsylvania passed a bill this year that will require future renewables to be purchased locally, about 0.5 percent of which needs to be solar by 2021. California, by contrast, passed legislation in May that will require all new homes to include solar panels or be served by solar panels in the neighborhood; it takes effect in two years.

Here, EIS Solar’s current business depends largely on the good intentions of people like the Millers, says Brian Krenzelak, an employee who installed the panels. It also depends on workers like his colleague, Scott Ferrari-Adler, who says he took a pay cut from a sheet metal job to work in an industry he believes in.

The number of renewable energy jobs is frequently used to persuade the public that going green can also mean earning green. Peduto and Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald cite a study that says there are 70,000 such jobs in Pennsylvania, and Allegheny County leads the way with more than 8,000. (The latest data from June shows 86,000 and 12,000 jobs, respectively, but the political rhetoric hasn’t yet caught up to the new numbers.)

Fossil fuels still dominate locally: There were more than 40,000 fossil fuel jobs in Pennsylvania in 2017, five times as many as in solar and wind. In the country as a whole, there are twice as many fossil fuel jobs as jobs in solar or wind. In places such as California, where the state does more to promote renewable energy, there are about twice as many jobs in renewable energy as fossil fuels.

Where are the green energy jobs?

There are a few reasons the region is lagging behind in green job creation. Among them is that there isn’t a lot of sun or wind in southwestern Pennsylvania, and the cost of electricity is cheaper than in places such as California or Massachusetts. So it takes people like the Millers much longer to break even on their investment.

The Keystone Energy Efficiency Alliance has highlighted the local Sheet Metal Workers union in Pittsburgh for its energy efficiency training. Keith Schettler, training coordinator at the union, says sheet metal workers used to do more work in solar energy before government funding was cut in 2012. Now, a focus has been on teaching “lagging,” a skill that will be needed to seal the aluminum piping at the new Shell cracker plant in Beaver County.

Fossil fuels still dominate locally: There were more than 40,000 fossil fuel jobs in Pennsylvania in 2017 , five times as many as in solar and wind.

While most green energy laws are created at the state and federal levels, cities such as Pittsburgh aren’t powerless. The Sierra Club has been trying to persuade cities to commit to 100 percent renewable energy, and Peduto has signed on in principle.

Soon after Peduto’s commitment in 2017, EverPower pitched the city on a new wind farm site that is ready to be developed near Somerset that could provide Pittsburgh with local green energy. Spencer, its founder and CEO, says that if renewables are going to be a substantial part of the energy mix here, then companies need long-term commitments from big buyers like the city.

""I think we’ve made [the city] a pretty compelling offer,” he says of the proposed 76 megawatts of electricity that 30 additional wind turbines could bring. ""There has just been little action.”

Right now, the city buys its energy in a consortium with the county, the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority and several other government agencies and nonprofits. The consortium purchases 35 percent renewable energy. But most of that is from green energy produced in other states. And the debate is just getting underway about how much green energy the consortium may buy locally in 2020, when it’s next due to purchase energy.

So while “wind farm technician” is one of the fastest growing jobs across the country, there is little sign that those jobs will be coming to southwestern Pennsylvania any time soon.

The technicians at Twin Ridges, one of the last wind farms built in the state in 2012, say their jobs are some of the only well-paying jobs in their rural communities. The jobs require electrical or mechanical aptitude but not a specific degree, so they are highly sought after. But they’re not for everyone. “People really don’t like heights,” says John Pelar, one of the technicians.

We’re not sexy

“Our goal is simple: We want to lead the world,” Peduto said at an April 19 event touting how far Pittsburgh has come at reducing energy use in its buildings.

John Quigley, former secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection, echoed the sentiment at a committee hearing on renewable energy in 2016. Pennsylvania has the third oldest building stock in the country, he testified, and these old buildings represent a unique opportunity.

“Energy efficiency is one of Pennsylvania's most abundant sources of energy…,” Quigley testified. “And energy efficiency is, in fact, the energy resource that creates the most jobs.”

Electricity saved is, from the perspective of climate change, just as good as additional solar or wind power because both reduce the amount of greenhouse gases used.

About 80 percent of the 70,000 green energy jobs in Pennsylvania are energy-efficiency jobs. (About a third of those jobs are in heating and air conditioning, making it unclear whether these are new jobs or modifications to how existing jobs are already performed.)

So before investing in renewable energy, Jordan of BW Research suggests Pittsburgh should do as much as it can to make its buildings more efficient.

It’s just that energy efficiency isn’t … sexy. Three energy experts said the same thing — “it’s not sexy” — to explain why energy efficiency doesn’t get the attention it deserves. “People gravitate toward renewables,” Jordan says. “But, in Pennsylvania, the opportunity is efficiency.”

The 2030 District, an initiative of the Green Building Alliance in Pittsburgh, is frequently cited by the city for spearheading this work. The voluntary coalition of building owners is the largest such district in the country to commit to reducing its energy (and water) use 50 percent below 2003 levels by 2030.

The 2030 District progress is also a reminder of how daunting the challenges are. Five years ago, the district announced that it had reduced energy consumption by 11.6 percent in its first year. Five years later, the district announced that it has reduced its energy consumption by a total of 12 percent.

With about three times as many buildings participating now than at the start, the 2030 District faces a dual challenge: it needs to further reduce energy use in buildings that have already made the easiest changes, such as adding more efficient light bulbs, while adding buildings that need to make both easy and expensive changes.

New York City has decided it needs to take a more aggressive tact to reduce energy use in its old buildings. The mayor’s office is pushing to make energy reductions mandatory, with large fines for building owners who don’t comply.

“As much as voluntary actions are needed, we are quickly getting to the point where we need to mandate what performance needs to look like,” Mark Chambers, New York’s director of sustainability, told a national green building conference in Pittsburgh in April.

Pittsburgh prefers to move forward without “legislative hammers,” says Angelica Ciranni, senior director of the 2030 District.

“We always look to things happening in New York and California and say, ‘Wouldn’t that be nice?’” she says. “I just don’t know that there would be a lot of support for that locally, especially given the fact that so much progress is being made.”

Too lucrative to fail

Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania aren’t leading the country at creating green energy, but they aren’t at the bottom either. The solar industry has been recovering slowly and, although there has been very little wind power added, Pennsylvania still is among the top 20 states at producing wind power.

But one of its biggest environmental success stories is about to flip.

Old coal-power plants, one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases, were being driven out of business, in large part, by the abundance of cheap natural gas. This contributed greatly to the United States getting halfway to its 2025 Paris Agreement goal to reduce its carbon footprint.

However, the natural gas industry’s success appears to be threatening the city’s progress on climate change. FirstEnergy recently announced that, without government intervention, it plans to close several of its nuclear power reactors, including the one in Beaver Valley, which supplies Pittsburgh with 70 percent of its electricity. A recent paper out of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology showed that the biggest cause of nuclear plant closures like this one is the availability of cheap natural gas.

Nuclear power is by far the largest source of carbon-free energy in Pittsburgh. Gas is about twice as clean as coal, but it looks positively dirty compared to nuclear, which emits virtually no greenhouse gases.

Right now, there isn’t much demand for building more power plants of any kind, whether it’s renewable, gas plants or any other. Electricity use has remained flat for more than a decade and PJM, which manages the 13-state region Pennsylvania is a part of, says there is already more electricity capacity than needed. So the gas industry is trying to sell more gas to homes in the state and then export the excess.

There is increasing demand for plastics, though. And the natural gas in the region isn’t just plentiful, it’s considered “wet gas,” the right type to make plastics. It’s 30 percent cheaper to produce plastic resin here than on the Gulf Coast, according to David Ruppersberger, president of the Pittsburgh Regional Alliance, who spoke at an April energy innovation conference at Carnegie Mellon University.

That’s why a recent report, commissioned by Chevron Appalachia and Peoples Natural Gas, predicted that the region could gain 100,000 jobs if it embraces policies that support gas production, cracker plants and the industries they will support.

Kevin Acklin, the mayor’s former chief of staff who now works as chief legal counsel for Peoples, said at an April 24 energy forum at the Heinz History Center that developing natural gas and plastics could increase the size of the state’s economy by 10 percent.

“Amazon set up this ‘Hunger Games’ competition among cities for us to compete for them to come here … But I would submit that the opportunity we have before us to transform this community is much, much larger if we get this right,” Acklin says of the economic potential of the region’s natural gas.

As Acklin spoke, a couple dozen protesters in the audience raised signs that said “dirty.” The environmentalists don’t want the region to be defined by natural gas and plastics, much like it once was defined by coal and steel.

If the world is to avoid the greatest harms of climate change, climate scientists believe people are going to have to leave some fossil fuels in the ground.

With the second largest natural gas field in the world underneath it, our region’s actions will have far-reaching consequences. Even some of the rosiest projections for adopting renewable energy include natural gas decades into the future.

Gov. Tom Wolf proposed using $200 million from a severance tax on natural gas to stimulate the construction of solar panels and wind installations and to improve energy efficiency. The idea is to use natural gas as a “bridge fuel” to a renewable future. But the proposal hasn’t gained traction.

Jared Cohon, president emeritus at CMU, moderated an April 5 panel about traditional energy sources. Cohon, who recently received a lifetime achievement award by the Pennsylvania Environmental Council, acknowledges that fossil fuels, especially natural gas, will play a major role in the country’s energy mix for a long time, even as many leaders are committed to reducing them. “But if you are going to use them, you want to use them wisely with maximum benefit.”

But it's not that there's a shortage.

In Cincinnati, 3 in 10 people don't know the source of their next meal.

That's not because there is a shortage of food. It's because of logistical challenges, getting fresh produce, meat and dairy to people who need them most — or getting the people to sources of food — before it spoils.

Take Todd Davis and Theresa McCalley of Walnut Hills, for example. They have an apartment on Oak Street, about three blocks from the Kroger grocery that closed in March 2017. The couple lives on a fixed income and in one of the city's most prominent food deserts.

""I don't drive, she don't drive, and them closing the store made it a lot harder on everybody,"" said Davis, who walked with McCalley on a recent Friday afternoon to buy vegetables and pasta at the Freestore Foodbank's Healthy Harvest Mobile Market. It pulled into the former Kroger parking lot along McMillan Street.

""Our building is mostly senior citizens. They can walk from their apartments for this,"" Davis said.

'Rescuing' the food

Improving healthy food options available in food deserts – defined as areas with a predominance of low-income residents who have limited access to affordable and nutritious food – is commanding a lot of attention locally these days.

The Soup Kitchen Summit formed a year ago and brings together soup kitchen operators, major social service agencies such as the Freestore Foodbank and Cincinnati's St. Vincent de Paul Society, philanthropy organizations and corporate partners, such as the Kroger Co., to find ways to work together to rescue more food and redistribute it more efficiently and quickly to people in need.

Nonprofit leaders in Walnut Hills and Avondale, another food desert neighborhood, are coming up with creative solutions to fill grocery spaces that are unlikely to ever be filled again by a traditional large store.

Community gardens and neighborhood- and school-based cooking and nutrition classes have received renewed focus as part of the solution to food deserts and poor diets and negative health outcomes that often accompany them. No idea or effort, big or small, it seems, is being dismissed or disregarded.

""It's the dumbest problem we have on the planet,"" said Jeffrey Miller, chief operating officer of Cincinnati-based Last Mile Food Rescue, which seeks volunteers using apps to get food that would go to waste to big food pantries. The idea is derived from Food Rescue Hero of Pittsburgh, which was founded in 2016 and continues to be refined.

Volunteers use an app that alerts them to a match between a food donation and a nonprofit who would like to receive it. They then ""rescue” the food.

""Hunger in Cincinnati is solvable. It's just people learning how to not throw out food,"" Miller said.

The need is great. So is the opportunity.

290,000 people, 80,000 of them children, are food insecure, the Freestore Foodbank estimates of its 20-county service region.

the Freestore Foodbank estimates of its 20-county service region. 6.6 million pounds of produce is distributed by the Freestore, enough food to make 27.3 million meals. Forty-two percent of its food is donated.

200,000 pounds of rescued food was recycled by Our Daily Bread in 2017, employing a small staff and volunteers to turn it into 96,000 meals and 21,000 second-helpings. It is a nonprofit soup kitchen and social center founded in 1985 in Over-the-Rhine that serves a free breakfast and lunch to anyone who walks through its doors Monday through Friday.

It is a nonprofit soup kitchen and social center founded in 1985 in Over-the-Rhine that serves a free breakfast and lunch to anyone who walks through its doors Monday through Friday. 60 million pounds of food is wasted a year in Hamilton County, which has a population of 814,000. That comes out to almost 74 pounds of food wasted a year per person in the county.

Food waste happens in many ways and to varying degrees, said Georgine Getty, executive director of Our Daily Bread.

""It's not eating a crust of bread to forgetting about the strawberries in the back of the refrigerator,"" she said. ""It's the vendors at Findlay Market preparing food for New Year's Eve, which ended up being really cold, and them needing to give it to us. On the largest scale, it's realizing that way too much food is sitting in the factory and is going to go to waste if they don't do something fast.""

Soup Kitchen Summit

Getty is one of three chairs of the summit, which formed about a year ago to try to fix the problem, Getty said, ""that we had all these hungry people.""

In a short time, however, its members realized ""we were part of something a lot bigger, an environmental problem, how do we save food that's being wasted and get it quickly to people who need it,"" she said.

Its themes are:

Food rescue. Sharing the most relevant information on community resources that lead to solving what summit members see as a ""logistics problem."" Creating a system for distribution that is sustainable.

Getting healthier food to people in need

Several organizations in Greater Cincinnati are working to rescue and redistribute food. Among them:

Last Mile: It recently partnered with United Way of Greater Cincinnati to tap into its volunteers who can serve as drivers, said Last Mile President and CEO Thomas Fernandez. ""They have lots of volunteers. We have a shared mission to fight poverty,"" he said. Last Mile is targeting its first deliveries for July 2019.

Freshmen: Through a $10,000 People's Liberty Grant from the Haile Foundation, Eban Taylor seeks to fill a need at the grassroots level. Freshmen is a community delivery service that offers grocery pickup to Avondale residents limited by access to healthy food, reliable transportation and technology.

""Our shopping behavior in the grocery store is now starting to interact with some form of technology,"" Taylor said. ""How do we still continue to create these experiences for people who are on assistance, and how do we make sure that they get the same experience where they are not missing out on the benefit of a convenient service model, service, whether it be online grocery ordering or delivery.""

Produce Perks Midwest: The Sharonville-based organization is a regional nonprofit that helps people in underserved communities get access to healthy fruits and vegetables. Produce Perks provides a dollar for dollar match to those using SNAP (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) cards, which are honored by farmer's markets and grocery stores. Recipients can purchase up to $10 per day in grocery stores and $20 a day at farmer's markets.

Bloc Ministries: In Price Hill, Bloc is working with Cincinnati State Technical and Community College to train chefs who can cook at home and get a job with those skills.

Gabriel's Place: In Avondale, this food ministry offers a farmer's garden and cooking classes, among its other food-based programs.

Those are smaller, community-based programs. Then there is a large-scale effort, the $10 million Zero Hunger/Zero Waste Innovation Fund, announced in February by Cincinnati-based Kroger Co. Foundation.

Innovators sent in letters of intent on proposals to prevent food waste. Grants will be awarded that range from $25,000 to $250,000.

The goals are ambitious:

Accelerate donations of nutritious food that provide 3 billion healthy meals by 2025.

Advocate for public solutions to address hunger and divert food waste from landfills.

Achieve internally that Kroger will be a zero-waste company by 2020 and prevent all food waste within all of its stores by 2025.

Food desert, Part I: Avondale

Avondale has not had a grocery since Aldi closed in November 2008. Its departure left the neighborhood of 12,500 people, the largest predominantly African American community in the region – without a source of fresh, healthful food.

A major component of the $29.5 million federal Choice Neighborhood grant of December 2012 was a grocery. Cincinnati Mayor John Cranley and city administration have promised a grocery in Avondale.

Nonprofit developer the Community Builders had a fully negotiated lease with Missouri-based grocery chain Save-A-Lot. But the lease was not signed because of a pending sale of the discount chain to a private equity investor that was finalized in October 2016.

For many years, corner stores have been the only sources of food in the neighborhood.

Community Builders and its partners, including the Avondale Community Council, had to adjust on the fly. Development of the Avondale Town Center at the corner of Forest Avenue and Reading Road began in 2017 without a grocery plan.

Slowly, though, it has taken shape. The vision is for a 15,000-square-foot grocer split into two spaces. Most of the space, about 9,000 square feet, will be a higher-end variety chain that will offer dry goods and benefit from professional on-site management and security. The adjacent 6,000 square feet with be a new concept that focuses solely on fresh produce, meat, baked goods and dairy products.

""The model is the old neighborhood butcher shop,"" said Jeff Beam, project manager for Community Builders. ""We're interested in customer loyalty, something that will establish the community-grocer relationship.""

The variety store will open first, and Community Builders is close to signing a contract on that space, Beam said.

The grocery is part of 80,000 square feet of commercial space on the ground floors of two new buildings and 119 units of mixed-income housing – market rate, low-income and workforce rental, Beam said. A model is open. Agents are leasing apartments. Residents are beginning to move in.

Food desert, Part II: Walnut Hills

When the Walnut Hills Kroger shut its doors in March 2017, the area became a food desert that was particularly hard on senior citizens and low-income families that did not have a way to access the new Corryville Kroger about a mile and a half away.

""It crushed the neighborhood,"" said one resident, Todd Davis, who now gets his vegetables and fruit during a two-hour time slot on Friday afternoons from the Freestore Foodbank's Healthy Harvest Mobile Market.

Lemuel Israel is the market manager for the Freestore.

""Warmer weather brings more people out,"" Israel said as a couple of shoppers moved through the trailer, which offers refrigerated milk, eggs and juice, a full display of produce and even spices, spaghetti and marinara sauce.

""The people are heartfelt. They tell us thanks for caring and for being here.""

MORE: Grant will lead to new Walnut Hills grocery

Neighborhood leaders have tried a number of temporary solutions to bridge the gap between the Kroger closing and the expected opening later this year of a smaller grocery tailored to community needs, said Gary Dangel, Healthy Outreach Coordinator for the Walnut Hills Redevelopment Foundation and a Walnut Hills resident.

The smaller store, expected to be created in a 4,000-square-foot space near the former Kroger store – which was 33,000 square feet – received a major financial boost in June 2018 with receipt of a $100,000 grant from Gannett Co. Inc.'s A Community Thrives program. Gannett is the parent company of The Enquirer. Later in 2018, the neighborhood redevelopment foundation received another $100,000 grant to use toward the grocery project from the Aetna Foundation.

Besides the mobile market, which visits Walnut Hills and nine other local food desert communities during a week – Walnut Hills is the most frequented stop, Dangel said – the neighborhood has brought in three different farmers' markets.

""Adaption had to happen,"" Dangel said. ""Besides losing a grocery store, we lost a social meeting place.""

The new Walnut Hills grocery space will be similar to the one planned for the Avondale Town Center. It will focus on fresh food options: produce, meat, dairy and baked goods.

""We want it to be pedestrian scale,"" Dangel said. ""This is a walkable neighborhood.""

New neighbors moving into Walnut Hills

The new grocery space also will offer community events, many of them food-related, such as cooking classes. It will benefit from other planned additions to the Peoples Corner area.

Taste of Belgium will move its corporate headquarters and employee commissary to a space on McMillan Street.

Nearby will be the expanded headquarters of La Soupe, a nonprofit that will be moving into a 6,000-square-foot space. It will be moving from a 900-square-foot building on Red Bank Road in Anderson Township.

Cooking classes and food-based events for Walnut Hills residents and those living in neighboring communities are part of the plan for the new space, said La Soupe Board President Mimi Dyer, ""events that blur the lines between volunteers and the people who come to see us. We're moving into Walnut Hills purposely because it's a food desert.""

MORE: Here's how La Soupe turns potential waste into good food

La Soupe's focus is on food access. Beyond its food-rescue efforts that engage chefs, its programs create community cooking events, teach cooking and bring a van into neighborhoods under a ""pay-from-your-heart' model. Its food runners get leftovers to agencies such as Our Daily Bread, Anna Louise Inn and others who can use it before it goes bad. Its suppliers include Jungle Jim's, the Crossett Co., Kroger and local farmers. About 1,600 pints of soup are donated each week. It is frozen in donated ice cream containers.

""There is more than enough food,"" Dyer said. ""We try to make it as easy as possible to get food to the people who need it most.""

Those additions to the neighborhood can't come fast enough for nearby Walnut Hills residents Davis and Theresa McCalley.

They appreciate the Freestore's mobile market. They walked home north on Gilbert Avenue to their apartment on the recent Friday. They carried vegetable greens, bell peppers and pasta in their bag.

The plan was to cook up some vegetable pasta for dinner.

McCalley smiled, looked at Davis and said, ""His recipe. He taught me.""",[]

The Kansas City Star reported that the group Free Hot Soup KC had intended to distribute food such as home-cooked chili, foil-wrapped sandwiches and soup to the homeless on Nov. 5.

But the city's health department confiscated the items at separate parks where the food was meant to be distributed.

Officials said that the volunteer group did not have a permit and that the food was not prepared in approved kitchens, therefore deeming it a public safety risk.

""E. coli or salmonella or listeria can grow in the food,"" department director Rex Archer told Fox 32, a local news station. ""And then you give that to homeless people who are more vulnerable, they will end up in the ER and even die from that exposure.""

Kansas City Mayor Sly James concurred with the sentiment, tweeting that ""rules are there to protect the public's health, and all groups must follow them, no exceptions.""

The Star noted that volunteers with Free Hot Soup KC returned to a park in Kansas City with meals on hand on Sunday.

About 175,000 food-insecure people live in Marion County (with a population of 940,000), 47,000 of whom are children. The USDA defines food insecurity as a “household-level economic and social condition of limited or uncertain access to adequate food.”

Community leaders came together Friday morning to discuss recent findings and efforts to address hunger at ""Hunger and Health: Time for Creative Intervention,"" an event presented by IBJ and Gleaners Food Bank of Indiana.

The event's purpose was to “reinforce the urgency of the call to action” around hunger and “raise the solutions up,” said Gleaners Food Bank President and CEO John Elliott.

The five members of the featured panel discussed in detail the links between hunger, health, education, transportation, employment and economic mobility.

“I think we have a false sense of security,” said Virginia Caine, director of the Marion County Health Department. “Marion County’s unemployment rate is very, very low so [people think] we must be doing fantastic because most people have jobs.” However, she said, many people are hungry because their jobs don't pay a living wage.

Fixing hunger would require more investment both money and volunteer manpower, according to the panelists. The Sagamore Institute estimates an $82-million-per-year shortfall in the investment needed to feed the county’s entire food-insecure population.

“We may think there’s a lot of money being put out there, but it’s not meeting the entire need,” Caine said.

But not solving the issue is also costly. Paul Halverson, founding dean of the Indiana University Richard M. Fairbanks School of Public Health, estimated that poverty and hunger create $3 billion per year in additional economic costs in Indiana, from health care expenses to lost economic opportunities.

That money could be much better spent on preventive public health care, he said. Indiana is the 39th-healthiest state in the nation, according to the United Health Foundation. That’s not a ranking we should be happy with, he said.

“There’s an ironclad linkage between good health and good economic prosperity,” Halverson said. “We need to recognize we can’t have one without the other.”

Sagamore Institute Vice President Troy Riggs urged the community to step up through volunteering to make progress on the issue.

“Money sometimes is a Band-Aid,” Riggs said. “We know what works. What it’s going to take is not just money, but people being actively involved.”

The panelists also drove home how hunger impacts the city’s schools, hospitals and neighborhoods.

In the Indianapolis Public Schools system, about 70 percent of the students qualify for the federal free- and reduced-price-lunch program. Superintendent Lewis Ferebee said people often think hunger simply distracts students from learning because their stomachs are grumbling.

“Actually, it’s much more concerning than that,” Ferebee said. “Students who do not receive regular nutritious food often have cognitive delays … that result in achievement challenges and learning disabilities in our schools.”

That’s one of the reasons Ferebee’s administration established a no-cost breakfast and lunch program for all students, and new programs to feed kids during academic breaks. But he said the school community still struggles with hunger because “we’re not there over the evening and the weekends.”

In hospitals, St. Vincent Health CEO Jonathan Nalli said, “poverty and other social determinants such as lack of transportation, lack of water, lack of food, play such an impactful role in diminishing health outcomes.”

Nalli said, based on his organization’s research, a food-insecure family incurs $1,800 more in health care expenditures each year than those who have food security.

“That is a population that is going to quickly choose between food and health care expenditures and access to health care,” Nalli said. “Access or lack of access to good food impacts any chance and ability for somebody with diabetes to get the right care and keep their diabetes under control.”

The challenge has led St. Vincent to start a weekend feeding program, and to set up and expand food pantries in its emergency rooms. The doctors and nurses have also started asking patients if they have faced hunger or food insecurity during the last year, hoping that more data will allow them to better target resources and help hungry patients.

Pacers Sports & Entertainment Vice Chairman Jim Morris, who also is a former director of the United Nations World Food Programme, reminded the audience that “the burden of this issue generally falls on the backs of women and children.” About a third of children in Indianapolis are considered to be below the poverty level.

“My view of our city is, there’s nothing more important than taking care of our children,” Morris said. “If we take care of our kids, I believe everything else will take care of itself.”",[]
https://radio.wosu.org/post/study-says-food-insecurity-columbus-much-worse-previously-thought#stream/0,['Columbus'],Study Says Food Insecurity In Columbus Much Worse Than Previously Thought,"Many people in Columbus are going hungry at times because they can’t buy enough nutritious food to last through the month. A new study by Ohio State University researchers found that a third of households in some neighborhoods struggle to get enough food.

That figure is twice as high as previously thought.

“We’ve got parts of Columbus that are experiencing... rates that over half the people we were surveying in those neighborhoods were considered food insecure,” says Michelle Kaiser, an assistant professor of social work at Ohio State and the study's lead author.

The study, ""A Tale Of Two Food Environments,"" was published last year in the Journal of Hunger & Environmental Nutrition.

Kaiser says many people skip meals, and experience health consequences both physical and mental.

“We see individuals who are food insecure having much higher levels of mental health issues, like depression and anxiety,” Kaiser says. “If you can imagine not knowing where your next meal is coming from or having to stand in line at a food pantry regularly, even though it’s a great opportunity, that that’s a very stressful experience.”

The Ohio State study took place in neighborhoods that intersect with High Street, including Franklinton, the Arena District, Italian Village, the Ohio State campus area, parts of Weinland Park, Linden, Milo-Grogan and the Near East Side.

In the study, 663 households answered questions about what kind of nutritious food they could access. Twenty-six percent responded they were not at all satisfied with their ability to access food. Twenty-seven percent said it was difficult to find fresh fruits and vegetables at their local store.

Overall, 32 percent of the households had low or very low food security.

Kaiser says often, there isn’t a full-service grocery store in the neighborhood.

“Their cards are sort of getting stacked against someone when you go to places, and yes, you can find some of your basic items, but we’re really setting people back when there’s not an opportunity to purchase healthier foods,” Kaiser said.

The zip codes with the highest rates of “very low food security” were:

43223 – South Franklinton and South Hilltop

43219 – East and Northeast Columbus

43211 – South and East Linden

43215 – Downtown, Short North, Arena District, and East Franklinton

43222 – Franklinton

Kaiser says hunger and food insecurity can have worse effects on people with health problems.

“Someone with diabetes or high blood pressure or high cholesterol is not able to meet their dietary needs in a way that is not just convenient, but it adds to the challenges they’re already experiencing,"" Kaiser says.",[]

Global Technical Systems (GTS) will invest $54.7 million in a new, electro-mechanical energy storage system manufacturing operation in the City of Virginia Beach, VA. Virginia successfully competed against Florida, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and Washington, DC for the project, which will create 1,110 new jobs with an average annual salary of $74,000.

“This green energy manufacturing center is a long-standing dream we’ve had at GTS,” said Terry Spitzer, CEO of Global Technology Systems. “Having steadily grown our business since 1997, we’ve continuously expanded our technical engineering competencies to meet the dynamic needs of our commercial and government customers. We have recently developed game-changing technologies that we believe will shape the future of renewable energy, grid modernization and other energy-dense storage applications. Central to our aspirations is delivering much-needed economic diversification and high-paying advanced manufacturing jobs. By undertaking development of this manufacturing facility and green energy storage market, we think we’ll be able to deliver on that aspiration in a truly meaningful way that will eventually touch the lives and economic security of thousands in our community.”

GTS, which provides advanced engineering solutions for defense, homeland security, and related U.S. government and international customers, will construct a 500,000-square-foot advanced manufacturing center to produce and distribute 100 percent green energy storage systems using advanced composites and engineering technologies. The new facility will be located on approximately 30 acres of land currently owned by the City of Virginia Beach, at the site of the former Owl’s Creek Golf Course. Construction will begin in the first quarter of 2018 and the facility will be operational in 2019.

“Global Technical Systems has called Virginia Beach home for 20 years, and an expansion of this magnitude is transformational for the city and the region,” said Governor Terry McAuliffe. “Creating well-paid, 21st-century jobs is fundamental to our mission to diversify and build the new Virginia economy, and today’s major announcement is another step forward. GTS models how traditional, defense-oriented businesses can expand their horizons and create new technologies with commercial applications that can change the world. We are proud to have GTS on the Commonwealth’s corporate roster, and excited about the company’s next chapter of growth.”

Founded in Virginia Beach in 1997, Global Technical Systems is a family-owned, small business led by Terry and Yusun Spitzer. The company’s expertise in advanced technologies generates products and services across a spectrum that includes: mission-critical combat systems processing, C4ISR, advanced carbon fiber systems, including grid and weapons power systems and munitions, biometrics, cyber security, military combat systems hardware production, advanced radar and sensor systems, and depot repair and logistics. GTS has traditionally provided innovative, high-tech engineering products and engineering services for commercial and Department of Defense customers from around the world, but saw an opportunity to create a new business model based on ground-breaking advances in carbon fiber technologies.

“I congratulate Global Technical Systems on its substantial growth and the City of Virginia Beach on this tremendous win,” said Secretary of Commerce and Trade Todd Haymore. “GTS’s expansion will have a sizable impact on Hampton Roads’ strong manufacturing community and will propel Virginia forward as a leader in this industry of the future. Our manufacturing sector, which employs more than 242,000 Virginians, continues to be a major driver of the economy, and we thank GTS for choosing to reinvest in Virginia Beach and the Commonwealth.”

The Virginia Economic Development Partnership worked with the City of Virginia Beach to secure the project. Governor McAuliffe approved a $1.8 million grant from the Commonwealth’s Opportunity Fund to assist the city with the project. The governor also approved a $3 million performance-based grant from the Virginia Investment Partnership program, an incentive available to existing companies. The company will be eligible to receive Sales and Use Tax Exemptions on manufacturing equipment, and will also be eligible to receive a Major Business Facility Job Tax Credit. Funding and services to support GTS’s employee training activities will be provided through the Virginia Jobs Investment Program.

“This is the type of project that every community in America wants,” said Virginia Beach Mayor William D. Sessoms, Jr. “A local, homegrown company develops a truly transformational new technology and makes the strategic decision to build it at home. With these new energy storage systems, that are 100% environmentally friendly, GTS has created the opportunity to change how the world manages our energy resources. This is an exciting day.”

Smith University's Sustainability Village program, chef Njathi Kabui went to work on a breakfast dish as he explained his cooking process to anyone who wanted to listen.

He began with an eggplant that he brought from his own garden. He sautéed the eggplant in a pot then began adding ingredients: diced tomatoes, onions, rosemary, basil, parsley, coriander, a small amount of peach, a few cracked eggs and a bit of ngaingai, a Congolese plant with a citrusy taste.

As he finished, he began scooping out the green and yellow grub and placing it on slices of seven-grain bread, then topping each one with a thin slice of cucumber before serving them to anyone in attendance, free of charge. His most important ingredient, however, was one that no one saw him toss in the pot: social justice.

""I call it Afrofuturistic conscious cuisine,"" he told me when I asked how he describes his food. ""It's cuisine that is steeped in the South and the struggle for justice and the influence of African food in the South. I understand food to be one of the most political things you ever touch in your life. People cannot be politically free if they don't have control of their food.""

And in that statement, Chef Kabui wrapped up the driving force behind a movement that has become stronger in Charlotte over the last two years; a movement to not only confront the food access gap in some of Charlotte's most underserved communities, but to tackle it head-on.

Organizations like the Sustainability Village, The Bulb and Rosa Parks Farmers Market in west Charlotte have been working — often together — to bring farm fresh foods to communities that have not historically had access to it.

The expression most folks use is a food desert, but Kabui calls that a loaded term.

""To say that there's a food desert, OK, food doesn't grow in the desert, but why do we use that word in actuality?"" he asked. ""The reason why we use that word is to make the crime of denying a people power less cynical or less biting. The reason why there are no foods in certain parts of the United States — one of the richest countries on the planet — is because people decide that those people should be powerless.""

And that's why Kabui, who has traveled the country teaching cooking demonstrations and giving speeches about food and its ties to social justice, has been happy to partner with the Sustainability Village and the Rosa Parks Farmers Market for the last three summers.

To be food insecure means to not have reliable access to affordable, nutritious food. Mecklenburg County's food insecurity rate is 16.4 percent, according to a report recently released by an independent consulting firm hired by the county. That percentage, which is higher than the national average of 13.4 percent, means that 173,000 Mecklenburg residents are food insecure.

Opened in June 2016 as a partnership between the Mecklenburg County Health Department and Johnson C. Smith and the Historic West End Partners, the Rosa Parks Farmers Market aims to bring that number down in the Beatties Ford corridor.

More than a year before opening, the county formed the Rosa Parks Farmers Market Community Advisory Council (RPCAC), made up of community members in an effort to find what residents would like to see in a local farmers market.

""We build things and then we expect people to come,"" said Elliot Royal, food access coordinator with the county's health department. ""But we wanted to build what that area was interested in.""

Some of the key points coming from community members included the desire to see people of color working the market. They also wanted the market to accept EBT cards, allowing them to use their Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits.

Organizers at the Rosa Parks Farmers Market have addressed both of these needs.

As for SNAP, organizers were happy to oblige. Not only that, they encouraged it. Royal said that Rosa Parks Farmers Market is the only farmers market in Charlotte that offers ""Double Bucks,"" meaning that customers can redeem up to $20 worth of SNAP benefits and buy double that amount worth of fruits and vegetables.

""In a month, we're able to enhance a family's nutrition intake by $80 [worth of food],"" Royal said.

As for the other feedback heard by Rosa Parks market organizers, much of the food being offered at the market comes not only from people of color, but from students learning their trade right next door.

Johnson C. Smith's Sustainability Village is a program that was launched in 2013 and played a big role in helping the Rosa Parks Farmers Market get its start. The initiative was launched to address food access issues in the city's northwest corridor. The program makes use of raised beds, aquaponics and hydroponic systems housed right on campus to help educate students and provide community members with accessible, healthy food.

During a recent Rosa Parks Farmers Market, which is held every Tuesday from 3 to 7 p.m., a group of students sat behind baskets of organic squash, zucchini, cucumbers, corn, peaches, tomatoes, okra, mint and more that had been grown on campus just a block away.

Brenda Montanez, a biology major working with Sustainability Village, said the selection was based on community feedback, rather than trying to tell folks what they should be eating.

Students with the organization have carried out community surveys by going door-to-door and are constantly seeking feedback from people who attend the market.

""We try to have as much as they will potentially use, so we grow products that they want rather than the ones that we think they would like,"" Montanez said.

Another bit of feedback Sustainability Village organizers heard was that residents have a hard time reaching the Rosa Parks market on Tuesday afternoon, according to Dr. Philip Otienoburu, director at Johnson C. Smith's Center for Renewable Energy and Sustainability.

""It's still a big barrier for people to access the market,"" Otienoburu said. ""Most people tell us that they'd prefer to have a Saturday market, because that aligns with their shopping schedule and is the time when they have free time available from work.""

He said that Saturday's Sustainability Village market was just a pilot program, and he plans to hold two more — one every other Saturday — to test whether enough people will come to make it worthwhile to bring on more vendors beside just the Sustainability Village students. The first Saturday market drew about a dozen customers in the first couple of hours when Creative Loafing was there. The next one will be held on September 1 at 8 a.m.

Though it may take time for residents to catch on to the Saturday markets, Sustainability Village will be moving full steam ahead. On Wednesday, August 22, Otienoburu and the rest of the Sustainability Village crew broke ground on the construction of three new greenhouses that are expected to quadruple food production on the campus, providing year-round nourishment for underserved communities on the west side. The expansion comes thanks to a $325,000 investment from Blue Cross Blue Shield.

Vivian Stuart, interim chair of the RPCAC, hopes the market can not only serve food but also help turn around a struggling piece of land. This summer, the market moved from the Mecklenburg County Health Department on Beatties Ford Road to a parking lot on West Trade Street. Across the street, the Mosaic Village flourishes, but the old A&P Grocery still stands boarded up and abandoned in the lot where the farmers market now operates.

Last year, there were reports of a restaurant incubator opening in the building, but nothing has come of it.

""It's a wonderful feeling for us, because they talk about the so-called food desert, and this is bringing fresh, affordable food to the community,"" Stuart said during a recent market. ""I can see it's going to rejuvenate this area. And that building, one day we expect it to open, and that will be also an advantage to the community.""

With all the fresh food coming into the community, folks need to know what to do with it. Upon the launch of the Rosa Parks Farmers Market in 2016, Otienoburu recruited Chef Kabui to hold cooking demonstrations there so community members could learn ways to take advantage of the new foods available to them.

""One thing that we wanted to do was, one, increase food access in the corridor, but also create the local capacity for not only growing food but also preparing food at home,"" he said. ""Because the culture of cooking is eroding in the community, and we can't just present a farmers market to the neighborhoods around here without guiding them on how to prepare their foods. These two things go hand in hand.""

The idea has been a hit, as Kabui has built a following of regulars who attend the Tuesday markets just to learn new tricks from him.

""It's a very, very special opportunity for me and it's something that's very dear across my heart,"" Kabui said. ""To look at people who are from underserved communities who are really beginning to understand food in a very complex way is very interesting to me; to see how people can begin to make very fundamental changes where they understand exactly the big implications of food.""

The big implications of food are not lost on Alisha Pruett.

As a social worker who moved to Charlotte from New York City in 2012, Pruett worked to find housing for homeless veterans. She quickly recognized the issues surrounding food accessibility in certain communities around the city.

""I would house [clients] and I would realize they were away from food access or food resources and even referring them to food pantries was a haul for them,"" Pruett said.

Furthermore, when she would go to the food pantries herself to pick up food for her clients, she realized that all of the food was processed.

""Even though that was a great resource, it was just not healthy food for the people I was serving. Diabetes was rampant in my caseload,"" Pruett said. ""I didn't feel comfortable with that, so I started going to farmer's markets and gleaning off of what they couldn't sell.""

Little did she know that her efforts to feed a family or two with the leftovers from farmers market vendors would turn into The Bulb, an organization she founded that now hands out an average of 800 pounds of fresh food per day to 30 underserved communities in and around Charlotte.

Pruett partners with local farmers, local organizations like Friendship Gardens, farmers markets and corporations like Trader Joe's to provide residents in food insecure neighborhoods with healthy food. Since launching in October 2016, The Bulb has provided nearly 10,000 pounds of free, fresh food to the communities that need it the most.

On a recent Thursday afternoon, I met Caroline Miller, a volunteer with The Bulb, at the Charlotte Transportation Center for a free market she helps organize there between 3 and 5 p.m. each week.

click to enlarge Caroline Miller at a recent Bulb market at the Transit Center. (Photo by Ryan Pitkin)

When I arrived, Miller already had a tent and a table set up with piles of fruits and veggies including apples, eggplants, squash, lemons, tomatoes, onions, lettuce, eggs and peppers of all shapes and colors. Some folks knowingly approached and began filling up bags, while it took others some time to realize that the cornucopia of fresh foods in front of them was for the taking.

As Miller worked alongside new Bulb employee Trenisha Birtha, the two were sure to meet each and every customer who approached the table, asking their names even while rushing to replace the rapidly diminishing piles of food on the tables.

Stephen Hayes, a north Charlotte resident who was at the Transit Center to commute between his day job and night job, filled a bag with zucchini, squash and spring onions that he said he would use for a casserole; eggplant for lasagna; and red peppers that he would find a use for in whatever he cooked, he said.

""This means a lot to me,"" Hayes said. ""This saved me 20 bucks. I'm not spending money that I work hard for but I really don't get to see.""

It's a sentiment that Pruett has seen shared again and again from thankful customers, some of whom don't have the ability to work two jobs like Hayes and are on a very fixed income.

""The average people we serve only have $15 in SNAP, and they really are struggling to get food,"" Pruett said. ""The corner store markets or Burger King, they're expensive meal for meal, and a lot of people are saving money and putting their money toward rent. I have seen — especially in the affordable housing units we serve — the eviction rates are going down, because they're saving about $200 a month with us being there weekly.""

Miller, who used to volunteer for Friendship Gardens but now focuses all of her energy on The Bulb, said she's been blown away by the generosity of customers who attend the Transit Center market.

""I've been most amazed at how appreciative people are that we're here for them, how overwhelmed they are that we're actually just giving it to them,"" Miller said. ""And also how much they want to help us. I find now that every time I show up for this market, I have this plethora of people that want to help set up and they ask about how they can get involved and help or volunteer. And these are the people in the community who are so affected by this generosity and what Alisha's created. I think it inspires them to give back as well.""

In fact, that's how Birtha got involved. She met Pruett through the market and volunteered to help. Then, in late July, The Bulb received a grant from the North End Smart District that will fund The Bulb for four months while it served eight North End neighborhoods on a weekly basis.

The grant didn't just help with gas money and other supplies, it also allowed Pruett to make a much-needed expansion, hiring three people from inside the neighborhoods she serves.

One of them was Birtha, who now works as an outreach coordinator with the organization. She said her goal is to one day start her own nonprofit, and her new job as put her on that path.

click to enlarge Trenisha Birtha (left) chats with customers at a recent Bulb market while Stephen Hayes picks out ingredients for a lasagna he planned on making. (Photo by Ryan Pitkin)

""Alisha needed help, and this is something that's perfect for me,"" Birtha said. ""I'm dealing with people that I'm comfortable with. I'm giving back. I can bring my kids. This is just always something that I wanted to do. I feel like it's a blessing because I didn't know where to start, and I got my start.""

While tents and tables like the one at the Transit Center used to be the norm, Pruett was able to take her market on the road this past June after completing a Feeding Innovation seed-starter program and receiving a grant from the SC Community Loan Fund.

The grant made it possible for her to buy a trailer. She's now able to drive around and set up shop much more comfortably in the communities she serves. Quicker set ups and takedowns allow her to hit more spots in a day, as well.

Once she arrives at a new location, she said, that's when the magic happens. That was evident on a recent morning in the Druid Hills neighborhood in north Charlotte, when two women got to talking while filling bags with veggies. The women were neighbors but had never met. Soon they were swapping stories and recipes.

""When you bring that nourishment to every community, you see people actually feeling better, communing around our truck or tables, and a lot of people start talking about recipes and what they're going to cook this Sunday, like we just heard,"" Pruett said. ""So I do think that it's a lot more than just distributing food, like other programs might. We know everyone's name and we try to initiate a conversation on how we get better as a community.""

click to enlarge Alisha Pruett prepares her mobile market.

Pruett often hosts cooking demonstrations wherever she sets up shop, similar to what Chef Kabui does at the Rosa Parks Farmers Market. Within the next year, she hopes to introduce a new type of community building by hosting art workshops out of the trailer while she's serving food.

She wants to allow folks to sell their art out of the trailer, giving them an opportunity to profit as creatives.

But in the immediate future, she'll be unveiling a new kind of art, as the Charlotte-based design firm The Plaid Penguin is currently working on a wrap for the new trailer, which is currently a plain white. She plans to show off the newly decked-out trailer at the Rosa Parks Farmers Market on Tuesday, August 28.

Pruett tries to be a vendor at the market as often as possible.

""That market is quintessential,"" Pruett said when I brought up the Rosa Parks market. ""It's not just a market, it's servicing the neighborhood, and seeing all these organizations come together and farmers and cooks and chefs, that's basically an ideal thing for us. That's the pinnacle example. We want to do that on the road.""

click to enlarge Njathi Kabui

Also at the market that day, you can expect to see Chef Kabui teaching folks how to make great food, all the while tying it in with the one thing he finds most important: empowering communities.

Kabui doesn't drive down from his home in Apex on a weekly basis just to throw some things in a pot and call it a day. He — like Stuart, like Pruett, like Royal, like Birtha — has a vision.

""The reason why the market is here is because of the very foundational unsustainability of the cultural and business practices that we have in this country, in the South and globally,"" he said. ""We do things without thinking long-term. We do things that are for market reasons, just on the bottom line, 'How much money am I making?' Obviously, now we are thinking slightly different. We have come to the realization that that's not always the smartest thing to do.

""As we reinvigorate this market, I hope that the message can be driven home that we have to make very, very fundamental changes, and among those are the way that we eat, the way we think about food and the relationship that we have with food, as a foundation for creating more just and more equitable societies.""

Get a daily rundown of the top stories on Urban Milwaukee

The city of Milwaukee continues to look for ways to bring healthy foods to all of its residents.

Although tackling the problem of food deserts and food swamps, the proliferation of unhealthy options in low-income neighborhoods, is proving to be a difficult task for the city to wrap its arms around.

Aldermen and alderwomen asked the Milwaukee Department of Community Development to develop a fresh food access strategy three years ago. On Tuesday, a city panel was presented with a report showing 21 percent of Milwaukee’s population, or 124,000 people, live further than 1 mile from a grocery store.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture defines a food desert as a low-income area where access to a full-service grocery store is 1 mile away. But Vanessa Koster, city planning manager, pointed out half a mile is a more reasonable distance to measure, since many residents don’t have access to vehicles.

Thirty-seven percent of Milwaukee residents don’t live within a half mile of a full-service grocery store, according to the report. Milwaukee’s poverty rate is about 25 percent. More than 37 percent of the city’s population is obese, according to the report.

City officials are looking at models that have worked nationwide, including in Baltimore and Philadelphia.

In Baltimore, the Baltimarket is a virtual supermarket program that has increased access to healthy food in neighborhoods with limited access to grocery stores. Pennsylvania subsidized a $30 million program in Philadelphia to increase access to healthy food options. That program included providing money to corner stores to pay for chillers needed for fresh fruit and vegetables.

One thing that has been working in Milwaukee is the Fresh Picks Mobile Market, an initiative between anti-hunger nonprofit Hunger Task Force and the Pick ‘n Save grocery store chain. The truck makes about 34 stops per month in the city’s food deserts.

Launched in October 2015, the mobile market sells produce, dairy and meat products all reduced by 25 percent.

Aldermen and alderwomen suggested trying to expand that program with city financing.

“We would be better off subsidizing a bunch of trucks than a bunch of big box stores,” said Ald. Robert Bauman. “I could see doing a blue-collar version of the Peapod service to bring food to the people.”

The city also has created a number of community garden initiatives and changed its ordinances to allow people to raise chickens.

The report identified several goals the city should be working toward, including attracting grocery stores to underserved neighborhoods, developing other retail outlets as sources of fresh food, increasing the stock of fresh food in corner stores, increasing the amount of locally grown food that is available to consumers, and improving transportation to grocery stores and farmers markets.

What was not clear was who in city government was going to be responsible for implementing these strategies.

“I get the gardens and I get the grocery stores, but we’re in Wisconsin, so the farmers markets and the gardens are great, but they’re not going to keep people fed year-round,” said Ald. Milele Coggs.

The city did not take any action on the report Tuesday.

PROVIDENCE — More than 100 people gathered on a golden September afternoon to celebrate a groundbreaking that’s been years in the making.

Urban Greens, which began as a co-operative buying club, incorporated in 2007, has been working to develop a strategy to open a full-fledged grocery store on the West Side since 2010.

“The work is just getting started, but this is a huge milestone,” said Cassie Tharinger, a longtime member of the Urban Greens cooperative council, as she observed the crowd showing up for the Sept. 14 groundbreaking.

Philip Trevvett, another council member who spoke at the event, noted that, “Co-ops take a lot of people working together, and what we’re building here is something all of Providence and Rhode Island can take pride in.”

The new store, which will serve what many would call a food desert — there are no large-scale grocery stores that serve the West Side — is expected to open next fall and is being built on a remediated brownfield. The site, the former home of Louttit Laundry, will host a grocery store and a multifamily building with six units of affordable housing.

The buildings, designed by Providence-based Truth Box Architects, will incorporate sustainable design features and rooftop solar.

“It’s a great project for the community. It’s the perfect nexus of affordable housing, investment in our neighborhood and investment in our local food economy,” said Providence Mayor Jorge Elorza, who spoke at the recent groundbreaking.

In the true cooperative spirit, when the time came for the official groundbreaking, it wasn’t just the dignitaries and political officials who got to wield shovels, there were shovels for everyone.

Urban Greens operates on a cooperative model and is owned by its members. As of groundbreaking day, membership stood at 815.",[]
https://www.deseret.com/indepth/2019/8/23/20830148/united-nations-salt-lake-city-united-national-civil-society-conference-inclusion-youth,['Salt Lake City'],United Nations looks to Salt Lake City for a ‘global conversation on inclusion and sustainability’,"SALT LAKE CITY — Almost half of the 6,000 attendees to a United Nations conference here next week will be young adults from 138 countries. But the large contingent of youth and the meeting’s location in the Mountain West will carry the same gravitas of previous gatherings at U.N. headquarters in Manhattan.

Indeed, the selection of Utah’s capital and heavy involvement of youth in planning and participating in the 68th Annual United Nations Civil Society Conference makes a statement.

“In visiting Salt Lake City I was struck by the rapid growth and innovation there, symbolized by the construction cranes dotting the beautiful mountain landscape, and by the sense of opportunity as young people flock to the region for its educational and job offerings. It is a great setting for a global conversation on inclusion and sustainability in cities and communities of all sizes,” Alison Smale, United Nations under-secretary general for global communications, said in the statement.

The three-day conference marks the first time it has been held outside of New York when the United States has been host. Paris, Mexico City and Melbourne, Australia, are among cities that have hosted the conference in the past.

This year’s event will focus on sustainable cities and communities. The topic is among the 17 sustainable development goals the U.N. General Assembly adopted in 2015. Others include ending hunger and poverty, reducing inequality, and promoting decent work and economic growth — all to be achieved by 2030.

“The Sustainable Development Goals are a global framework for cooperation to tackle the great challenges of our day,” said Maruxa Cardama, conference chairwoman and secretary general of the non-governmental organization Partnership on Sustainable Low Carbon Transport. “Cities are growing so quickly that it is imperative we build them thoughtfully and make extra efforts to ensure that no person or group is left behind.”

More than half (55%) of the world’s population lives in urban areas and that figure is expected to reach 68% by 2050, according to the U.N. The conference is intended to help government and nongovernment leaders find sustainable solutions to poverty, housing, hunger and health, clean water, energy, climate change, infrastructure, transportation, education, migration, violence and gender equality.

More than 90 percent of Utah’s population lives along the densely populated Wasatch Front corridor, with Salt Lake City located near the midpoint of the more than 100-mile stretch of cities and towns connected by roads and transit systems.

Conference organizers were persuaded by Salt Lake City officials that the city’s efforts to tackle many of the issues the conference will address make it an ideal location.

“With everything we are doing to build a sustainable and resilient city, from investing in more equitable transit and housing to becoming a clean energy city — Salt Lake City is the perfect place to have these important conversations,” Mayor Jackie Biskupski said.

It will be one of the largest international events the city has hosted since the 2002 Winter Olympics.

“It’s fitting that the U.N. is holding this here in that Utah is recognized globally as a place with a robust free market economy and civil society,” said Deseret News Opinion Editor Boyd Matheson. He will moderate a panel discussion on how faith groups and other nongovernmental entities can offer people upward mobility, or opportunities to improve their economic situation.

Youth movement

The annual conference used to be heavily focused on the work of non-governmental organizations — nonprofit agencies engaged in humanitarian, educational, health, human rights and environmental endeavors.

But a U.N. reorganization and renaming of departments and sections resulted in changing the name to Civil Society Conference, which better describes the broader group of stakeholders involved, including young adults, said Annie Deng, co-chairwoman for the Outcomes Sub-committee and sub-task lead on the Youth Declaration for the conference.

Biskupski said the city made an intentional effort to recruit youth in the planning and carrying out of the conference. In fact, a record 43 percent of the attendees will be 32 years old or younger, she said.

“We want this younger group to be at the table and having their voices heard because they are living with these issues today.”

“We like 32 years because that is the average age” of the world population, she said. “We want this younger group to be at the table and having their voices heard because they are living with these issues today.”

Vlada Yeramenko, 23, is among the dozens of local college students who got involved in organizing events for the conference. A native of Ukraine who graduated in May from the University of Utah with a bachelor’s degree in international relations, she said her academic interests and her personal experience as an immigrant inspired her to get involved.

Her mother’s marriage brought Yeramenko to the United States when she was 15. She spoke little English, but a welcoming community in Sante Fe, New Mexico, helped her assimilate, develop her skills as a violinist and eventually find her passion in international relations.

“This is a conference for everyone to feel included, and then to work to find solutions to the problems that we’re facing right now,” she said.

The young adults are also injecting an element of fun with their work. Before attendees begin three days of speeches and absorbing information from about 200 workshops, youth planners put together events on Saturday where they will be planting trees, cleaning up a section of the Jordan River, relaxing to yoga and discussing the U.N.’s sustainable development goals.

The conference will include youth-led workshops and unveil a Youth Climate Compact that was drafted with input submitted before the conference from young adults around the world, said Deng.

The lengthy document lists nearly two dozen action items — ranging from recycling and consumption awareness to divesting in fossil fuels businesses and converting to renewable energy sources — that youth pledge to do to “unite in action against the climate crisis.”

Sustainable cities

Biskupski said the city’s negotiated agreement with Rocky Mountain Power in 2016 to provide 100% renewable energy by 2032 was a factor that caught the attention of U.N. officials reaching out to Salt Lake.

“That made news across the country because cities had not been able to get their energy providers to really move the needle on going to 100% renewable,” she said.

The city’s investment in affordable housing, transit development and infrastructure were other components to its proposal that won over the U.N. a year ago this month.

Another factor is the state’s involvement in humanitarian work, said Baldomero Lago, chief international officer for Utah Valley University, who first suggested to U.N. officials that they reach out to Salt Lake, the Deseret News reported in March. He had access to U.N. officials through after his Utah Valley United Nations, a group of humanitarian relief groups, business and faith-based groups, gained U.N. accreditation.

“We talk about sustainability, but it is the humanity that actually makes things happen to sustain the world that we live in,” Lago said in November, when the city announced it was hosting the conference.

Also at that announcement was Ahmad Corbitt, a director in the public affairs Department of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who added that cities are sustained first and foremost by residents’ willingness to give of themselves.

The church is offering that opportunity at the conference. Its U.N.-affiliated Latter-day Saint Charities is partnering with Feeding Children Everywhere, American Airlines, JustServe and conference participants to assemble 375,000 meals for needy children during the three-day event.

Latter-day Saint Charities Director Sister Sharon Eubank will also sit on a conference panel in a Tuesday session titled Civil Society Monitoring. Bishop Gérald Causeé, presiding bishop of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, will offer brief remarks at the conference’s closing plenary session on Wednesday.

https://eu.tennessean.com/story/money/2018/12/06/nashville-economy-income-health-housing-statistics/2139279002/,['Nashville'],"Nashville thrives, but residents struggle with health, housing, traffic","State of Nashville: As economy thrives, residents struggle with health, housing, prosperity

Median income gains in Nashville lag peer cities, prenatal care is declining in nearly all Middle Tennessee counties, health insurance coverage has dropped and the percentage of residents living below the poverty line is on the rise.

New data released by the Nashville Area Chamber of Commerce in its annual Vital Signs report comes in stark contrast to the steady stream of economic wins the city has experienced in the past year: record low unemployment rates, expanded GDP and the recruitment of big name companies and organizations including Amazon, Alliance Bernstein, Ernst & Young and Major League Soccer.

While business headlines point to prosperity, many residents are not feeling the gains, based on data gathered over the past decade. Both the Nashville and Clarksville areas face increasing challenges in housing, health, education and infrastructure, in spite of — or because of — their rapid growth.

""A lot of the challenge has to do with not keeping up with critical infrastructure,"" Ralph Schulz, CEO of the chamber, said. ""In a lot of ways, we are now bumping up on what those challenges can mean to our future prosperity.""

Income, education

Across all levels of education in the Nashville area, the percentage of those below the poverty line has increased between 2007 and 2016, even as unemployment rates have dropped across the board. More than 22 percent of Davidson County children live in poverty and more than half of the region's counties saw an increase in the percentage of students participating in a free or reduced lunch plan in the past decade.

More recent data shows an improved trajectory. From 2014 to 2017, Nashville poverty rates have declined each year, dropping from about 15 percent to 11 percent, according to chamber officials.

Education is strongly linked to poverty rates and income levels, with 24 percent of those in the Nashville area who lack a high school diploma living in poverty, compared to 11 percent for those who graduated.

Compared to the nation, Nashville has a greater percentage of individuals without a high school diploma — 9.6 percent to 4.5 percent — but it also has a greater percentage of those with a bachelors, graduate or professional degree.

In-migration, which contributed to 70 percent of the region's growth in 2017, is contributing to gains in educational obtainment. Among those moving to the Nashville area from other states, nearly half have a bachelor's degree or higher. Of those moving from another country, about 58 percent have those credentials. That compares to between 33 percent to 36 percent among those already in the Nashville area.

Tennessee has sought to boost education levels in recent years with initiatives such as Tennessee Promise, Drive to 55, Labor Education Alignment Program and Tennessee Reconnect Act.

Cost of living

In 2009, Nashville ranked below peer cities in cost of living, but by 2017 the area jumped above Columbus, Indianapolis, Charlotte and Raleigh. Meanwhile, median income gains are lagging. Median household income increased 5.3 percent, or by $3,042, between 2006 and 2016, but Nashville lagged many of its peer cities in income gains. Clarksville's median income declined in that period.

""The change in wage growth, salary growth coming out of the Great Recession was a relatively modest change compared to previous business cycles,"" Garrett Harper, vice president of research for the chamber, said.

Health

While Nashville is known for its health care expertise, the city exceeds the national average in the percentage of those lacking health insurance. In Nashville, 9.5 percent of residents lack health insurance, compared to 8.7 percent nationally.

In 2016, 46 percent of employers offered health insurance, down from 69 percent in 2006. Other than Charlotte, Nashville had the most dramatic decline among peer cities in the percentage of employers dropping coverage.

From 2012 to 2016, the percentage of expectant mothers with adequate prenatal care, defined by the number of doctor visits during pregnancy, dropped in every Middle Tennessee county except Dickson and Montgomery. In Sumner and Cannon counties, the percentage fell by close to 11 percent.

""Good health starts with prenatal care and only about half of the infants born in the Nashville region have received adequate prenatal care,"" the report said.

After birth, many Nashville-area children lack health care. Nashville has had significantly higher numbers of children without health insurance compared to peer cities in recent years. About 13,000 Nashville children lacked health insurance in 2016, compared to fewer than 5,000 in Raleigh, Austin, Cleveland and Seattle.

State lawmakers have rejected efforts to expand Medicaid in recent years, even as Gov. Bill Haslam proposed expansion plans. During his campaign, Gov.-elect Bill Lee said he would oppose Medicaid expansion and described the existing program as ""fundamentally flawed.""

In Davidson County, more than 35 percent of students in public schools are obese. In Hickman, Smith, Maury, Robertson, Rutherford and Cannon, the percentage exceeds 40. The long-term costs of obesity include hospitalization, pharmaceutical expenses and work productivity losses, according to the report.

""It's impacting our employers' ability to get employees who can be there and be fully present,"" Jennifer Carlat, the chamber's chief policy officer said. ""The labor market is tight enough that we are looking at all of these issues because they are important to all of our members.""

Housing, transportation costs

Nashville-area residents are increasingly cost-burdened, spending more than half their income on housing and transportation.

In Nashville, the median cost of housing increased by 54 percent from 2008 to 2018, climbing to $246,500 from $159,800. While Nashville offers competitive wages compared to the national average, residents are increasingly spending a majority of their earnings on housing and transportation, according to the report.

At issue is the available inventory, which has not caught up with demand, chamber officials said.

""The overall cost of living in the region remains lower than the national average,"" Schulz said. ""The increased cost of living, especially as it relates to housing, due to increased demand outpacing supply, is one of the most common challenges attributed to our growth.""

The cost of infrastructure needs in Davidson County alone totaled $5.7 billion for nearly 690 projects, including those related to education, transportation and health. Tennessee received ""C"" or lower grades on its inland waterways, school facilities, transit, drinking water and wastewater infrastructure.

In recent years, the chamber has featured costs of commuting and congestion in its Vital Signs report. The chamber-backed Let's Move Nashville initiative to fund $5 billion in public transportation upgrades under a plan called nMotion failed to gather Davidson County voter support in May 2018. Chamber officials said the next proposal could be created between 2022 and 2024.

""The referendum, when it failed, it said Davidson County wasn't ready to put dedicated funding to this,"" Carlat said. ""The nMotion plan is still the plan, but now they know they have a constrained budget they have to implement that plan through. The next few years are going to be about, what are all the ways we can squeeze more efficiency from the system we have?""

As infrastructure projects pile up, the region's population is growing. From 2007 to 2017, the Nashville area's population grew by 25 percent, or 400,000 people, to 1.9 million people. In 2017, the area grew by 94 people a day, the chamber reported, citing U.S. Census data.

Nashville's growth rate was ranked behind Charlotte, Austin and Raleigh.

""Our population growth exceeded what we were anticipating in the mid-2000s,"" Harper said. ""(We've) seen a resurgence of migration in the period since the Great Recession nationally and particularly here it has contributed to the population growth.""

Although most local households saw their incomes grow last year, Greater Memphis reclaimed its distinction as having the highest poverty rate of any metro area in the nation populated by at least 1 million people, new census estimates show.

The percentage of residents in the nine-county area living below the poverty level rose from 18.4 to 19.4 as Memphis traded spots with the Tucson, Arizona, as the most impoverished of the 53 largest metro areas in the U.S., according to 2016 estimates from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey.

The increase came even as the median household income for the metro area rose 2.6 percent to $49,809 last year.

""I think our poverty is a structural problem. It's not going to be resolved by changes in the economy,"" said John Gnuschke, director of the Sparks Bureau of Business and Economic Research at the University of Memphis.

Gnuschke said the modest rise in incomes, although welcome, does little to counteract the barriers to employment -- such as criminal records, drug problems and lack of transportation -- that keep a sizable portion of the local population locked in poverty.

With its rising poverty, Memphis diverged from national and statewide trends. Across the U.S., 14 percent of residents were living below the poverty level in 2016, compared to 14.7 percent the year before, while Tennessee's poverty rate fell from 16.7 to 15.8 percent last year.

Incomes also were on the upswing on the state and national levels, as well as locally. In Tennessee, the median household income rose 2.7 percent to $48,547 in 2016, while the nation as a whole saw a 3.3 percent gain to $58,617.

Across Tennessee, Nashville was the only metro area whose median household income ($60,030) topped the national figure. It also had the lowest poverty rate, at 11.6 percent, of any metro area in the state.

Despite the income growth, the number of people in the Memphis area living below the poverty level of $24,250 for a family of four grew to more than 256,000 last year, an increase of more than 13,000 from 2015. The poverty rate declined slightly among white and Hispanic residents, the census figures show, but it increased among African-Americans.

The percentage of Memphis-area children in poverty rose from 28.8 to 30.8. High school-dropouts were six times more likely to live below the poverty line than college graduates.

All major ethnic groups in metro Memphis enjoyed gains in median household income. But black households still were taking in just $35,542, barely half the $67,781 median for white households.

The census figures also documented the continued decline in the number of people with no health insurance -- trend that could end if Congress doesn't bolster exchanges operating under the Affordable Care Act.

Statewide, 9 percent of the population had no health insurance last year, down from 10.3 percent in 2015. In metro Memphis, the percentage of residents without coverage fell from 12 to 10.1.

A look at figures for other metro areas in Tennessee

Chattanooga: Poverty rate, 14.3 percent; median household income, $46,537; percentage with no health insurance, 8.5.

Clarksville: Poverty rate, 15.5 percent; median household income, $51,373; percentage with no health insurance, 8.5.

Jackson: Poverty rate, 17.8 percent; median household income, $42,373; percentage with no health insurance, 8.9.;

Johnson City: Poverty rate, 17.2; median household income, $40,943; percentage with no health insurance, 8.4.

Kingsport-Bristol: Poverty rate, 18.2; median household income, $40,811; percentage with no health insurance, 8.7.

Knoxville: Poverty rate, 14.4; median household income, $49,862; percentage with no health insurance, 8.1.

Nashville: Poverty rate, 11.6; median household income, $60,030; percentage with no health insurance, 8.7.

https://wtvr.com/2019/10/01/virginia-high-eviction-rates-cns/,"['Richmond, VA']",What’s behind Richmond’s higher than normal eviction rates,"RICHMOND, Va. — Scholars, lawyers, and lawmakers are still grappling with high eviction rates in Virginia and how to enact solutions. A panel Thursday at Virginia Commonwealth University addressed the Eviction Lab at Princeton University’s findings that five cities in Virginia ranked in the top 10 for national eviction rates, including Richmond, Hampton, Newport News, Norfolk and Chesapeake.

The local eviction rates ranged from 11.4% in Richmond to 7.9% in Chesapeake. The rate represents the number of evictions per 100 rental homes in an area.

About 150 people attended the event, which included three panelists: Six Points Innovation Center director Jackie Washington, Virginia Poverty Law Center attorney Phil Storey, and Sen. Jennifer McClellan (D-Richmond).

McClellan highlighted seven bills that passed the recent General Assembly session and were signed into law. The legislation included bills that made written leases required, reduced the number of eviction cases a landlord could file, created the opportunity for tenants to submit unpaid rent and fees prior to eviction, and allow tenants to recover their possessions.

“This is not really a partisan issue,” McClellan said. “Where there is disagreement, it’s really sort of the landlords versus tenants, and I don’t mean to say that all landlords are bad or all landlords are predatory.”

Of the seven housing laws signed by the governor last session, four were introduced by Democrats and three by Republicans.

McClellan also said in a phone interview after the event that more bills to address eviction, including a bill to address the habitability of a rental property, are in the drafting and planning stages now.

Though legislators passed a flurry of bills last session to reform landlord and tenant laws, Storey said “way too many people are on the knife’s edge because of the way the system is designed.”

Much of the discussion at the panel held at VCU’s W.E. Singleton Center for the Performing Arts centered around how tenants fall behind on rent payments.

“Two-thirds of the people who call our hotline are behind on rent, with the average caller being around two and a half months back,” Storey said.

Storey also said that on average their clients are paying 58% of their monthly gross income to rent, with some paying as much as 70%.

Panelists also discussed the link between discriminatory housing policies and the eviction rate today, which according to the RVA Eviction Lab increases as the share of the African-American population in a neighborhood increases. Washington highlighted historic redlining in Richmond’s Jackson Ward neighborhood, where banks would avoid making real estate investments based on neighborhood demographics, as “an intentionally racist housing policy.”

“If we don’t connect the dots from historic housing policy, then we just might miss it,” Washington said. “But those who experience it will never miss it. Folks of color will always know that it’s racist.”

Storey agreed, saying that “things that seem sort of natural and immutable are often not and are based in some pretty ugly root causes.”

The panel was sponsored by VCU’s L. Douglas Wilder School of Government and Public Affairs, VCU University College and Virginia’s home for Public Media. The panelists were introduced by Benjamin Teresa and Kathryn Howell, co-directors of the RVA Eviction Lab at VCU, which opened this year and provides eviction data and research.

“One of the goals of the lab is to do research that is relevant to Richmond and other cities in Virginia, as well as outside of the state,” Teresa said.

The panel was connected to this year’s VCU Common Book, a program that selects a new book each year for incoming freshmen. The initiative is intended to foster awareness and engagement around important issues.

Incoming freshmen received a copy of “Evicted,” a book by Matthew Desmond, the founder of the Eviction Lab at Princeton University. Freshman-level courses incorporate the book into coursework and discussion. Desmond is scheduled to visit VCU on Oct. 16.

Candidates from many Virginia House and Senate districts will have a chance to weigh in on evictions at a forum on Oct. 10. Candidates from 11 House districts and from six Senate districts have been invited to participate, though the list of confirmed attendees has not yet been released.

The event will be moderated by VPM and held at the Virginia Museum of History & Culture.

Let’s Finish the Job.,"The New Orleans City Council took a step towards making history last week. By voting in support of the dismissal of municipal and traffic warrants, fines and fees, the Council created an opening for more than forty-thousand New Orleanians to escape a vicious cycle of poverty and incarceration. With council members, judges, community advocates, and directly impacted city residents coming together to imagine a more just criminal legal system, our city is positioned to jump from being the target of civil rights lawsuits to being a leader in reform.

Dismissing existing fines, fees and warrants is only the beginning. Lifting the shadow currently hanging over the heads of tens of thousands of New Orleanians will help many escape the cycle of poverty and criminalization, but every day that the current system exists, more will get sucked in. We need a whole new system, focused on accountability and restorative justice.

”This is not a justice system. This is a wealth extraction system that has criminalized poor people of color, trapped us in a cycle of poverty, and used the profits to fund itself.”

Tina Weary struggles to make ends meet as a preloader for UPS. She could more than double her income by getting promoted to being a driver, but her license is suspended. Six years ago, she was pulled over and fined $792 for driving uninsured and with brake tags the police officer thought were fake. She couldn’t pay the fine and was put on a payment plan that she couldn’t afford either. She slowly fell behind until a letter arrived one day notifying her her license had been suspended.

She’s been unable to drive ever since and she feels trapped. A bicycle doesn’t get her very far in New Orleans East and her wages as a preloader don’t get her any closer to paying off her traffic debt. It’s a catch-22 with no obvious escape.

Tina is not alone. A staggering one in seven adult New Orleanians has a warrant out for their arrest. As we found in our recent report, NOLA Shakedown: How Criminalizing Municipal Fines & Fees Traps Poor & Working Class Black New Orleanians in Poverty, more than 56,000 outstanding warrants are in the Municipal and Traffic Court, and the vast majority of these warrants are for minor offenses that cause little to no harm to society, including thousands for crimes of homelessness and poverty. Given that New Orleans has the highest poverty rate of any major American city, it’s no surprise that tens of thousands of New Orleanians have been swept up into this cycle.

It’s also no coincidence that the burden falls disproportionately on Black New Orleanians. Louisiana has the highest race and gender wage gap in the nation, with Black women earning 47 cents for every dollar earned by a white man. The median household income for Black residents in Orleans Parish in 2017 was $24,418, compared to $63,482 for white residents. As a result, sixty-nine percent of people with warrants are Black, further entrenching racial inequality in the criminal legal system.

This is not a justice system. This is a wealth extraction system that has criminalized poor people of color, trapped us in a cycle of poverty, and used the profits to fund itself. Historically, the city’s court system has been funded by fines and fees, tying court budgets to the number of people who walk through the door and the dollar amount they are charged. Perversely, when factoring in the cost of jailing people for nonpayment, these fines and fees are a financial drain on the city.

After years of advocacy and a series of lawsuits, however, things are beginning to change. City Council’s vote calling for the Municipal Court to wipe outstanding fines, fees and warrants is a crucial step in the right direction and a display of the type of leadership we should expect from our elected officials. The openness to reform and creative solutions that Municipal Court judges like Judge Paul Sens have shown is incredibly heartening too. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of New Orleanians like Tina want to get back on the right side of the law if they only had the means to do so. If we all work together, nothing is stopping the city from not only addressing past harms, but ending the criminalization of poverty going forward, too.

For years, opponents of reform have argued that there are no viable alternatives to regressive and punitive fines and fees with the threat of incarceration for those who cannot pay. But around the world, other systems have been tested and proven. Courts in Latin America and Europe have used day fines—fines set based on the defendant’s daily personal income—for decades to promote accountability and equity. By adjusting fines based on ability to pay in this way, these courts ensure that no one is punished because they’re poor and that no one escapes meaningful accountability because they’re rich. This system also maintains overall revenue without resorting to a regressive mechanism that exacerbates income inequality.

For those who are unable to pay even a small fine, we know that humane, dignified community service is possible. This does not need to look like anyone being subjected to humiliating or hazardous work that paid workers refuse to do. Instead, restorative justice practices that are gaining traction in courts around the country show us that non-monetary alternatives can not only provide accountability, but also open up opportunities for rehabilitation and restitution.

These are models that we can and must adopt. Every New Orleanian deserves to open their mailbox without fear that they will have to choose between paying their electric bill and paying a traffic ticket. Every New Orleanian deserves to drive down the street without fear of being arrested for driving while poor. Every New Orleanian deserves to walk down the street without fear that the color of their skin or the emptiness of their wallet will land them in a jail cell. We can’t shy away from imagining a just future. With last week’s city council vote, and with the support of the Court, the Mayor and the people of New Orleans, that future is within reach.

https://indyweek.com/news/wake/will-raleigh-go-big-on-affordable-housing-2019/,['Raleigh'],Will Raleigh Follow Durham’s Lead and Go Big on Affordable Housing This Year?,"If affordable housing’s a game, Raleigh is losing.

Every year, the city loses far more affordable units than it can replace; a 2016 study found that Raleigh needs to add another thirty-two thousand to keep up. Home values that have doubled over the last decade have turned the housing market into a pressure cooker. Meanwhile, gentrification runs wild in Southeast Raleigh, with historically black neighborhoods being devoured by white buyers building luxurious homes on tiny lots, as The New York Times recently noted.

In Durham, which is facing similar issues, Mayor Steve Schewel has proposed a $95 million housing bond, the largest ever in North Carolina—further fueling perceptions that Raleigh isn’t doing enough. With an election looming and affordable housing topping the list of voters’ concerns, the Raleigh City Council is under pressure to do something meaningful to address this burgeoning crisis.

But it’s not clear what that something will be.

The council will hear a presentation from staff Tuesday—after the INDY goes to print—that includes options for what an affordable housing bond referendum might look like. To get the bond on the October ballot, the council needs to make a decision by June 18, according to housing and neighborhood director Larry Jarvis.

To match Durham’s $95 million bond, Raleigh would need to raise its property tax rate—currently 43.82 cents per $100 of assessed value—by 1.25 cents, or about $25 a year for a $200,000 home.

Complicating matters, on Monday night Wake County’s manager recommended that the Board of Commissioners increase property taxes by 10 percent, mostly to account for $1 billion in school construction, parks, and Wake Tech bonds voters passed last year, but also to bump school funding by $36 million and county operating expenses by slightly less than that. If commissioners approve the manager’s recommendation, the owner of a $200,000 property in Wake County will add $128 to their tax bill.

For Raleigh homeowners, these hikes would be cumulative.

Jarvis wouldn’t say how big a bond the staff would recommend, though he plans to give the council three options. The money could be used in several ways, including building new affordable rental units, down payment assistance for first-time buyers, and rehabbing properties in low-income neighborhoods.

Ideally, Jarvis says, a $100 million bond could produce about three thousand units, though that depends on the kind of tax credits used for specific projects. Even that scenario, though, would only begin to put a dent in the problem.

“We shouldn’t be looking at just this one tool,” Jarvis says. “It really is, across the board, what can we do to increase all housing types, housing choices?”

A majority on the council, however, has seemed reluctant to increase density in neighborhoods, which advocates say would increase the supply of housing and thus help keep prices in check. Instead, the majority is looking to voluntary inclusionary zoning—in other words, asking developers to include affordable units in projects for which they’re seeking more intense zonings—as a way to address the problem.

Another complication is the timing of the bond, Jarvis says. A bond this year would be the only referendum on the ballot. But next year, Raleigh voters could see another school bond or a bond to fund Dix Park, or both, and they might get gun shy; then again, a presidential election draws more people to the polls, likely giving the bonds a better chance of passing.

Council members Russ Stephenson and Stef Mendell say they want a bond on the ballot this year for somewhere between $50 million and $100 million. Mendell says she hopes the council can be “bold and ambitious,” while remaining sensitive to the city’s increasing tax burden.

“While we’re trying to build five hundred to six hundred [affordable units] a year, we’re losing about a thousand a year,” Mendell says. “The hole keeps getting bigger, and we have to do as much as we can to fix that. At the same time, obviously, we have to be careful because there are a lot of people who, with gentrification, their property values have increased and their property taxes have increased.”

No one’s district has been more affected by gentrification than Corey Branch’s, who represents Southeast Raleigh. He wants a $120 million bond.

“The very people we’re trying to help and give opportunity to, we want to make sure we don’t negatively impact,” Branch says. “So it’s finding that balance.”

https://wfpl.org/study-as-louisvilles-economic-gap-shrinks-racial-disparities-remain/,['Louisville'],"As Louisville’s Economic Gap Shrinks, Racial Disparities Remain","A new analysis from a national nonprofit research organization finds Louisville has gained some ground over the past three decades when it comes to shrinking inequality between the richest and poorest city residents. But sizable gaps still remain between white residents and those of color.

The report, released Wednesday morning by the Urban Institute, ranks 274 of the country’s largest cities on economic health, economic inclusion and racial inclusion.

The study looks at four years: 1980, 1990, 2000 and 2013. In Louisville’s case, the city-county merger happened during that period. Because of that, the study tried to maintain consistency by looking mostly at data from inside the former Louisville city limits.

“So, when we’re looking at the concept of an inclusive recovery, we’re saying in the period of time when a city is improving its economic health, we’re asking the question are they also improving the conditions and the outcomes for people of color and lower income residents in that community,” said Urban Institute Vice President and Chief Innovation Officer Erika Poethig.

“And so we’re seeing how those changes are happening and whether their outcomes are improving at the same time other people that have more advantages are improving.”

Urban Institute

The city improved 58 rankings on overall inclusion — from being ranked 252 in the nation in 1980 to 194 in 2013. When economic and racial inclusion are separated out, the city’s gains for economic inclusion are even more dramatic: from 230 in the nation in 1980 to 118 in 2013.

But when it comes to racial inclusion, the city’s progress has been relatively static.

The report breaks down the individual metrics that go into the rankings. Louisville became less segregated over the study period, and also made gains in shrinking the education gap between whites and people of color. Some of that is attributed to Jefferson County’s school assignment program — which integrated public schools here — while programs like 15,000 Degrees get a shout out, too.

Urban Institute

But in some aspects, racial inequality is starker now than it was in 1980. Take homeownership.

In 1980’s Louisville, there was a 15 percentage point difference between people of color and whites who owned their own homes. By 2013, that divide had widened to a 32 percentage point difference: a much larger divide than seen in the country as a whole.

“The gap is both growing and accelerating at a rate that is a cause of concern,” Poethig said. “The leadership in the city should be focusing on what’s driving that gap, but also thinking about strategies to ensure that access to capital is provided to people of color in the Metro area. Or if there are other issues that are impeding people’s ability who want to become homeowners to become homeowners, to really unpack what those barriers or challenges are.”

Urban Institute

Overall, Poethig said Louisville is an example of a city that’s making gains in shrinking both income and racial gaps. And just in terms of overall economic health, the city rocketed from being ranked 252 in the nation in 1980 to 4th in the nation in 2013. That’s largely due to jumps in employment and a rising overall median income — though the study noted that was helped by the merger.

But economic health isn’t sustainable unless it includes people all over the city, Poethig said.

“Unless you’re also thinking about how that health is shared across different groups, the sustainability is going to be challenged,” she said. “And so, we’re hoping that people will look at this and say ‘what are the intentional actions we can take to ensure that as we grow and we recover from economic challenges, that we can make decisions that are to the benefit of as many people as possible?’”

https://gothamist.com/news/nyc-poverty-level-drops-record-lows-income-inequality-persists,['New York'],"NYC Poverty Level Drops To Record Lows, But Income Inequality Persists","New York City’s poverty rate has declined to historic lows, amid increases in both median household income and jobs , according to new census data.

On Tuesday, the de Blasio administration said the city’s poverty rate fell to 17.3 percent in 2018, a drop of 3.5 percent since 2013. The poverty rate is the lowest rate for the city since the American Community Survey began releasing annual data in 2006, according to the mayor’s press release. City Hall also said that based on its analysis of decennial census data, the poverty level is also the lowest since the 1970s.

In 2016, the city's poverty threshold for a household consisting of two adults and two children was measured as $32,402.

Between 2013 and 2018, median household income grew by 13 percent, to $63,799 from $56,298. During that same period, jobs increased by about 500,000. The city's unemployment rate in 2018 was 4.1 percent, the lowest since the data was made available.

The declines in poverty and unemployment in New York City follow a national trend, according to the most recent census numbers. Across the U.S., the number of Americans with income below the poverty level is 13.1%, down from 13.4% in 2017. Nationally, the number of Americans with income below the poverty level is 13.1%, down from 13.4% in 2017, while the unemployment rate fell to 3.9 percent, roughly the lowest it has been since 2000, when it was at 4 percent.

Other cities, including Los Angeles, Chicago and Washington D.C. also experienced a drop in poverty rates.

Mayor de Blasio this week trumpeted the milestone, saying he had fulfilled his pledge to “end the Tale of Two Cities,” a reference to his 2013 campaign slogan.

Fewer New Yorkers are living in poverty.

But since coming into office in 2014, income equality has been relatively unchanged in New York City, according to a report last month by the Manhattan Institute. The report also relied on census data, specifically the Gini coefficient, a measure of income inequality, from 2014 to 2017. The mayor's office responded to the report by saying that the indicator does not capture the full picture of economic gains made by lower-income New Yorkers.",[]
https://observer.com/2018/06/new-york-city-public-school-segregation/,['New York'],NYC Has the Most Segregated Schools in the Country. How Do We Fix That?,"Earlier this month, Mayor Bill de Blasio rolled out a plan to revamp the admissions process at eight of New York City’s specialized high schools in an effort to expand diversity at the schools.

It was the closest the second-term mayor—who has been reluctant to use the word “segregation” when discussing public schools—has come to pushing for integration of the most segregated public school system in the United States. He first vowed to change the specialized high school admissions process during his first mayoral campaign in 2013.

The plan, which the mayor and New York City Schools Chancellor Richard Carranza—who has taken a more aggressive stance on school segregation, even declaring that no ethnic group “owns admission to these schools”—involves phasing out the Specialized High School Admissions Test (SHSAT). Seats would be given to the top seven percent of students from each of the city’s 600 middle schools.

Black and Latino students make up nine percent of SHS offers but 68 percent of all high school students, according to the de Blasio administration. In 2016, 21 middle schools—or 4 percent of all middle schools—constituted 50 percent of SHS offers.

When the test is phased out, 45 percent of offers would go to black and Latino students, compared to nine percent at the moment. Sixty-two percent of offers would go to female students, compared to 44 percent currently. The plan also revives the Discovery program, which seeks to expand enrollment of low-income students, in the city’s specialized high schools.

Although the state Assembly’s education committee passed the bill that would eliminate the test, state Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie announced that he would take up the issue next session. Gov. Andrew Cuomo has yet to take a position on the plan, saying that integration is a “legitimate issue” and that it should be revisited as part of the debate on mayoral control of city schools next year.

Alumni groups, leaders and elected officials in the Asian-American community expressed opposition to the plan on the grounds that it would take away seats from Asian students, who make up 62 percent of students at specialized high schools.

The controversial plan has reignited conversations about the longstanding segregation that has plagued the city’s public school system—which has 1.1 million students in more than 1,800 schools—and the right approach to achieve integration.

NYC Takes on Diversity

In June 2017, the city’s Department of Education (DOE), which operates the public school system, released its first citywide school diversity plan.

Since the release of the plan, Manhattan’s District 1—the Lower East Side and East Village—implemented the city’s first district-wide school diversity plan, according to the DOE. And Manhattan’s District 3 and Brooklyn’s District 15 are working on district-wide plans.

The department told Observer the plan goes hand in hand with the city’s Equity in Excellence for All agenda, referring to the mayor’s universal prekindergarten initiative and “3K for All,” which is free, fully-day early childhood education for all 3-year-old children. The department also referred to Universal Literacy, which has the goal of making sure every student is reading on grade level by the end of second grade; Algebra for All, which seeks to improve elementary and middle school math instruction; and College Access for All.

“We’re committed to equity and excellence for all students—that means high-quality, diverse schools across the city, and we are working closely with communities to make that vision a reality,” Will Mantell, a DOE spokesman, said in a statement.

David Bloomfield, professor of educational leadership, law and policy at Brooklyn College, told Observer the plan was “far and away the closest [de Blasio] has come” to a citywide integration plan and that it is unclear “how serious he is about this.” Bloomfield also wondered why the mayor did not scrap the test at the five schools that do not require state approval.

De Blasio said his predecessor, Michael Bloomberg, “ignored and exacerbated the problem,” referring to how school choice under Bloomberg’s tenure “rather than mixing kids, promoted enclaves.” He said people expect more from a “self-described progressive mayor.”

He also noted that the city’s School Diversity Advisory Group—which is responsible for assessing the city’s school diversity plan—is still deliberating.

Bloomfield said, “I don’t think you can have it both ways: use commission members to endorse a proposal while he also has them supposedly debating the proposal. And so I think in many ways de Blasio’s approach to issues of segregation has been weighted toward the political rather than the educational or social justice.”

He called on the mayor to call school segregation what it is—once and for all.

“He needs to stop blaming residential segregation for the segregation of schools,” Bloomfield continued. “That would be a huge step forward. And to use clearer language. Segregation is segregation, and diversity waters down the message.”

Time for Change

Taylor McGraw, adult facilitator for Teens Take Charge, a student-led movement for educational equity in the city, who grew up in Mississippi, said New York schools are still segregated because “they were always segregated.” After the landmark 1954 Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court ruling that declared segregation in public schools unlawful, the city’s 1956 integration plan fell apart due to “massive white resistance.”

“Every time the city promotes some small integration effort, there is immediate backlash and this is—people have talked about the specialized high schools—it’s a very dramatic example of the segregation that exists here,” McGraw said.

The Hecht-Calandra bill of 1971 established the city’s first four specialized high schools—Stuyvesant High School, Brooklyn Technical High Schoo, Bronx High School of Science, and Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Performing Arts—and required the former three schools to only use SHSAT for admission.

That test, McGraw explained, was put in place to combat discrimination and ensure that only merit is considered.

“From a policy perspective, I think it is an excellent strategy, and it’s worked in higher education,” he continued, referring to the mayor’s plan. “It has the support of the research community in New York City.”

Brooklyn Assemblywoman Rodneyse Bichotte—the first Haitian-American woman elected into office in the city and a graduate of LaGuardia—told Observer that before the de Blasio administration came in, certain middle schools in the black and Latino communities were stripped of their gifted programs.

She contended that there is room for improvement and that she likes the mayor’s “radical plan,” arguing that restoring the Discovery program will benefit students who are not aware of the schools.

Bichotte also praised de Blasio for extending seats to all middle schools because it reflects the “true top performers.” She had a 98 percent average but chose not to take the SHSAT because the tests were “culturally biased,” referring to her struggles with English that she said “would have been a factor of me not doing well on the test.”

“When I was in middle school back in the late 80s, I ranked number three in my school, number three, and if this program was in place, I would have had a seat waiting for me,” Bichotte said.

Naomi Peña, a parent who serves on the Community Education Council (CEC) in District 1—which serves the Lower East Side and East Village of Manhattan—stressed the importance of the city taking initiative on the issue.

“I think on the K through 8 level, there is some sort of push on, ‘Let it be community-led,’ but it’s harder to do that on the high school level because high schools are a very different animal altogether… It’s harder to control aspects of a school community when you can have students that cover all five boroughs,” Peña said.

Lilah Mejia, a single mother who is also in the District 1 CEC, said five of her six kids are in public school. One of her sons excelled in his classes but she skipped the SHSAT because it was a competitive and lengthy process.

“To hear the mayor wanted to tackle that diversity and start off with the testing, I’m excited. I think those testings are ridiculous,” Mejia said. “I couldn’t pay for prep testing If I wanted to. Does that mean by son doesn’t deserve it?’

Janay Daniel, a graduate student at New York University’s Graduate School of Public Service who has been working in the public and charter school systems for nearly 10 years, grew up in a low-income community in Brooklyn and took the SHSAT but did not get in because her test score was not high enough.

She attended Bard High School Early College, a four-year public school that provides students with a two-year tuition-free college course of study.

“I was very privileged to be able to have a quality education that allowed me to go to a great university that really launched my career, but there are a lot of students in New York City who do not have the same privilege of getting into a quality high school if they do not get into a specialized high school,” Daniel said.

It’s the Wrong Approach

Former Bronx Assemblyman Michael Benjamin, a member of the editorial board of the New York Post who attended Bronx Science, blasted the mayor’s plan.

“I don’t understand why he rolled it out so late in the legislative session,” Benjamin said. “He didn’t—in my mind—acknowledge, engage the various…communities about this plan.”

David Lee, education committee chair of the Chinese American Citizens Alliance of Greater New York, graduated from Brooklyn Tech in 1978. He told Observer that before his class, the school was majority white but in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s, it was majority black and Hispanic because there were honors classes in elementary and middle schools. Despite the fact that the current test was codified into law in 1971, a test has been in use for the last 90 years, he explained.

“In the absence of the ‘Special Progress’ classes and honors classes, the Asian community—they found a replacement for it, they found a solution for the lack of these rigorous classes, and that was the enrichment classes, after-school weekend classes,” he said.

He opposes the mayor’s plan, pointing to a study conducted by Sean Corcoran, associate professor of economics and education policy at NYU, that shows that any method other than the test would bring down the schools’ academic rigor.

DOE told Observer the average GPA of a student in the top seven percent of their class, at 94 percent—the same as students who received an SHS offer this year. The average state test score of a student in the top 7 percent of their class is 3.9, about the same as students who got an SHS offer this year, at 4.1 on a 1 to 4.5 scale.

State Assemblywoman Yuh-Line Niou, who represents Lower Manhattan, said that while the school system is “very, very segregated,” specialized high schools are majority-minority because most of the students are Asian.

She referred to DOE’s plan to increase diversity in Community School District 1 that involves a school choice system. And she noted that it is hard to get into specialized high schools if students do not attend the “feeder” middle schools that guarantee admission to them.

“That’s like over half of the specialized seats go to… 20 middle schools, and if you go to an elementary [school] that can’t get you into those, then your chances are greatly reduced,” Niou noted.

Parent advocate Mona Davids, president of the New York City Parents Union—whose daughter graduated from LaGuardia two years ago—called the mayor’s plan an “avoidance scheme” and accused him of refusing to address the root of the problem, which she says is K-8 education.

“The fact of the matter is that the majority of students, especially black and Latino students in the public school system are not reading, writing and doing math at grade-level, and this does not start in the eighth grade,” Davids said. “This starts in the elementary schools, both elementary and middle schools.”

And she noted there are other “great” public high schools that do not require a test that are segregated, pointing to schools like Bard High School Early College, Hunter College High School, Townsend Harris High School, and Beacon High School.

Brooklyn Councilman Mark Treyger, chairman of the Council’s Committee on Education and a former public school teacher, believes segregation is a “very serious problem” but that it has to be addressed and fixed in an “inclusive and meaningful way.”

“Integration should start sooner than the ninth grade in a few schools that make up under two percent of our entire student body,” Treyger said. “So with all due respect to the mayor, this was more of a two percent-plan at the 11th hour because there were only 11 days left in session in Albany.”

The current plan, he noted, does not include enrichment programs and expansion of Gifted & Talented (G&T) programs—which supports exceptional students in kindergarten through fifth grade—in communities of color. DOE said the administration added G&T classes so there is an option in every district.

So how do we end segregation?

The debate over the admissions process for specialized high schools exposed the myriad views—and widespread division—on how the city should achieve integration of the public school system. For McGraw, the process of integration starts with “something pretty simple”: aiming to amplify integration as much as possible.

“You have to adopt the philosophy that our guiding principle when we think about school policy is going to be to maximize integration in every possible way at every possible level, and we have not seen that at all,” he said.

Under the previous chancellor, Carmen Fariña, he said, the policy was to let integration happen organically, noting that in areas such as District 1 and District 15, parent advocates and school leaders “have made some headway.”

Integration, McGraw said, could come in the form of redrawing school zone lines or getting rid of them as well as bussing.

Jorge Morales, 18, a senior at New Heights Academy Charter School in Harlem and a Teens Take Charge leader, told Observer his school is 96 percent Latino and about three percent black. He is part of Teens Take Charge’s policy team.

“We focus a lot on high school admissions and how we can develop a proposal to ensure that our high schools are diverse… High schoolers are able to travel in different places all over the city,” Morales said.

Peña similarly called for a change in mindset—she urged people to put aside their privilege and show empathy toward other families and students.

“This work requires ownership of your personal feelings and your biases, and that’s messy, that’s very messy work,” she said, adding that parents are often fixated on what they want “versus what’s right.”

She also said people have to change their mindsets as far as what constitutes a good school, noting that just because alumni attended Ivy League schools does not mean that other high schools “aren’t as capable of doing the same.” As to DOE, she said the department has struggled with transparency and communication.

Mejia said teachers need to become aware of different students’ circumstances.

“It’s having more training for teachers who come into these black and brown neighborhoods who are not aware of the culture, the struggle,” she said, giving the example of ensuring kids who live in shelters get meals.

Others called for zoning reform. Bloomfield said the community school districts were set up along racial and ethnic lines. He also called for greater curricular opportunities at low-performing schools.

“There needs to be a citywide effort… that citywide effort has to entail both a technical approach to zoning and other issues as well as community outreach,” he said.

Indeed, Daniel called for the entire high school process to be an open enrollment process in which students can pick schools based on location and career interests, for example. But she conceded it would be a tough endeavor, referring to parents on the Upper West Side who were “infuriated” over a plan first reported by NY1 that seeks to integrate middle schools in the neighborhood.

Her own parents did not want her to go to her zoned middle and high schools due to the quality of the education.

“I think the zoning process is honestly one of the most dated systems in our city, and I think it has allowed segregation to persist in New York City public high schools,” Daniel said.

Others were skeptical of the push for a citywide integration plan. While Lee supports integration, he wondered whether it is what parents in the city want. He says he does not support “forced integration.”

“They really want to attend schools in their communities, but they want the quality, they want the quality,” he said. “So a parent will send their kid to another district to attend a school because of the quality. But you have to imagine that if they had a choice, a quality school in their own neighborhood, they would like to stay in their neighborhood.”

Benjamin says the solution is improving middle schools as well as education overall in neighborhoods that are majority black and Latino. And he added that screened schools—schools that have discretion over who is admitted—have low proportions of black and Hispanic kids.

“Integration at this point in time is a red herring,” Benjamin said, calling the screened schools the real problem. “In school districts where you can show where black and Hispanic kids are being sort of screened out, then that needs to be overcome.”

He pointed to a study by The New School’s Center for New York City Affairs that found that 40 percent of black parents are opting their children out of their neighborhood school. He also noted parents are opting their children out of public schools and that a number of black and Hispanic kids are going into Prep for Prep, a leadership development program that gives students of color access to private school education.

“Carranza and de Blasio don’t seem to get that,” Benjamin maintained. “They’d rather focus on phony social justice issues rather than the core mission of educating children well and attracting their parents to want to be a part of the city school system.”",[]
https://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-rothstein-segregated-housing-20170820-story.html,['Los Angeles'],Op-Ed: Why Los Angeles is still a segregated city after all these years,"Every metropolitan area in the nation is racially segregated, and Los Angeles is no exception. We tolerate residential segregation because we’re convinced that it happened informally — because of personal choices and private discrimination. But what cemented our separate neighborhoods is something most of us have forgotten — government’s unconstitutional and systematic insistence on segregated housing in the mid-20th century, establishing patterns that persist to this day.

The 2010 census data show that 60% of Los Angeles’s African Americans live in neighborhoods where few whites are present. The exposure of blacks to whites is as minimal as it is in Chicago or Newark; concentrated African American poverty is as common in L.A. as in New York or Pittsburgh.

The New Deal created the nation’s first civilian public housing in the 1930s, segregated not only in the South, but nationwide. In his autobiography, the African American poet Langston Hughes recounted his adolescence in World War I Cleveland, where he dated a Jewish girl and his best friend was Polish. But during the Depression, the Public Works Administration demolished a part of that mixed neighborhood and built separate white and black projects, creating segregation where it hadn’t previously existed.

During World War II, more than 10,000 African American families moved to Los Angeles for jobs in military production, and government-mandated segregation moved west. Desperate for labor, companies were hiring black workers for the first time, yet unless these migrants could find housing, war mobilization would stall. Although the city’s public housing authority had vacancies in white neighborhoods, it denied them to African Americans. The federal government had to intervene.

Douglas Aircraft in Santa Monica employed 44,000 workers. When Washington proposed a Venice housing project, white residents objected to African Americans living nearby. When one was planned in Compton, also then all-white, there were more protests. The government relocated both projects to Watts. Before the war, Watts had been integrated, with about equal numbers of whites, blacks and Latinos. By 1958, it was 95% black. Public housing policy was largely responsible for this segregation.

White homeowners gained, over succeeding generations, hundreds of thousands of dollars from rising equity; African American renters did not.

Suburban expansion financed by the Federal Housing Administration, another New Deal agency, was also discriminatory. In the Los Angeles area, Panorama City, developed by Henry J. Kaiser in the late 1940s, and Lakewood, developed by Mark Taper and his partners, were FHA-supported on explicit condition that African Americans be barred. FHA rules stated that “incompatible racial elements” would disqualify builders from essential federally backed loans. The FHA also frequently required that property deeds prohibit resale to African Americans.

Other federal programs reinforced segregation. The IRS should have denied tax-exempt status to nonprofit institutions that discriminated on the basis of race, yet it systematically did the opposite in Los Angeles and elsewhere. The pastor of the Wilshire Presbyterian Church led a campaign to bar African Americans from his congregation’s neighborhood, and he personally sued to evict a black war veteran who had moved there in violation of a racial deed restriction. Whittier College, historically a Quaker school, participated in a neighborhood compact in which homeowners agreed not to sell property to African Americans. Both church and college kept their tax exemptions.

In smaller ways, local government contributed. In 1943, Culver City convened a meeting of air raid wardens whose job was to ensure that families dimmed evening lights to prevent Japanese bombers from finding targets. The city attorney instructed the wardens also to press homeowners to sign pledges never to sell to African Americans.

In 1948, a black family moved to all-white Eagle Rock. A police officer led a mob that included Chamber of Commerce members and the local Kiwanis president to burn a cross on an adjacent lot. The officer was in uniform, confident that his superiors approved. From 1950 to the 1965 Watts riots, more than 100 bombing and vandalism incidents attempted to eject African Americans from white L.A. neighborhoods, but just one arrest and prosecution resulted, and that happened only because the California attorney general intervened when local prosecutors claimed police could not identify the perpetrators.

In 1968, Congress adopted the Fair Housing Act, prohibiting discrimination in the sale and rental of housing; it added enforcement procedures 20 years later. But the law only affected future discrimination; it did nothing to undo the segregation that government had spent the previous 35 years imposing.

Nationally, homes in FHA subdivisions built in the mid-20th century typically sold for about $100,000 in today’s currency; they would have been affordable to black working-class families. But, denied the opportunity to buy them, most African Americans were forced to rent, often in cities from which jobs subsequently disappeared. White homeowners gained, over succeeding generations, hundreds of thousands of dollars from rising equity; African American renters did not. Today, average national black income is 60% of whites’ but average black wealth is only 7% of whites’, a disparity mostly resulting from unconstitutional federal housing policy. (Those mid-century FHA homes, which today sell for $300,000 and often much more, are now out of reach for working-class families of any race.)

Our entrenched residential segregation exacerbates serious political, social and economic problems. It traps the most disadvantaged young African American men in high-poverty neighborhoods, with inadequate access to good jobs or education, where police function as an occupying force. It impedes upward mobility: Low-income African American children in segregated neighborhoods are more likely to remain poor as adults than similarly low-income African American children raised in more diverse neighborhoods.

And segregation defeats efforts to close the black-white academic gap. Teachers can devote special attention to a few children who are in poor health, or stressed because of family economic instability, or who have had inadequate early childhood learning experiences. But in schools where most pupils suffer from such challenges, instruction becomes mostly remedial and behavioral problems erode teaching time.

To overturn these patterns requires measures designed specifically to remedy government’s earlier imposition of segregation. For example, municipalities should repeal zoning laws that use criteria such as density level and lot size to prohibit apartments and even modest single family homes and townhouses from being built in affluent white neighborhoods. Rental subsidies need to be set on a sliding scale so low-income families can afford to live in middle-class communities.

We should now insist on integration as aggressively as we did segregation in the last century. To achieve that, politically and legally, we have first to acknowledge that our government, to a substantial degree, created our racial inequality. Letting bygones be bygones is not a valid, just or defensible policy.

Homelessness in the city of Los Angeles proper, meanwhile, jumped by 16 percent, according to the latest annual census by the Los Angeles Homeless Service Authority (LAHSA), despite a concerted push by local officials to move more people from the streets into permanent housing.

Overall, the authority counted nearly 59,000 people sleeping on sidewalks, in makeshift tents, in abandoned vehicles or in shelters and government-subsidized “transitional housing” on any given night in Los Angeles County.

That’s the highest number documented since the agency began conducting its “snapshot” survey 10 years ago and follows a 4 percent decline in homelessness the year before.

The number in the city of Los Angeles alone, including the notorious downtown Skid Row district that ranks among the greatest concentrations of homeless in the United States, reached 36,300, the study said.

“Only New York has more people experiencing homelessness on any given night,” LAHSA Executive Director Peter Lynn said in releasing the report.

A major factor cited for the worsening situation was the rising cost of housing, coupled with wage stagnation at the lower end of the income spectrum that has led to a housing affordability crisis across Southern California.

California already has more people living in poverty than any other state, and Los Angeles County has the state’s highest poverty rate, at 24.3 percent, the study said.

“Skyrocketing rents statewide and federal disinvestment in affordable housing, combined with an epidemic of untreated trauma and mental illness, is pushing people into homelessness faster than they can be lifted out,” Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti said.

‘HOMELESS CAPITAL’

Nearly 22,000 people who were without a place to live were moved into permanent housing in 2018, up 23 percent from the year before, through efforts funded by a special voter-approved bond measure. But more than double that number have fallen into homelessness over the same period, LHSA said.

Tenant rights activists blame gentrification and real estate policies favoring high-end commercial and residential developments that are squeezing out low-income housing.

Critics also accuse local officials of doing too little to develop thousands of vacant units that could be reconditioned and turned into affordable apartments.

“L.A.’s homeless crisis is a failure of imagination and will built on a foundation of corruption at City Hall,” said Michael Weinstein, president of the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, the parent nonprofit of the groups Healthy Housing Foundation and Housing is a Human Right.

“It’s not accidental that LA County is the homeless capital of America,” he added.

The homeless authority said one-third of all Los Angeles households are severely rent-burdened, meaning they spend more than half their income on rent.

Still, the 12 percent homelessness rise in Los Angeles County was modest compared with corresponding increases in less populous neighboring counties - up 28 percent in Ventura, 43 percent in Orange and 50 percent in Kern.",[]
https://chicago.curbed.com/2019/10/10/20908479/chicago-teachers-strike-affordable-housing,['Chicago'],Chicago teachers fight for affordable housing in contract negotiations,"Chicago teachers put affordable housing on the bargaining table and Mayor Lori Lightfoot isn’t willing to discuss it. It’s one of the main issues in union negotiations that have led Chicago Public School teachers and support staff to strike on Thursday, October 17.

The Chicago Teachers Union, which represents more than 25,000 teachers and staff, still hasn’t resolved issues involving pay and staffing in addition to more contentious topics like housing and ensuring there’s a librarian in every school.

The union representing Chicago Park District workers were expected to strike along with CTU complicating contingency plans for more than 300,000 students, but earlier on Wednesday they reached an agreement with the city.

The next contract with the city will have to be about more than just pay and benefits—the union wants housing assistance for teachers and students. Lightfoot says affordable housing should be addressed broadly and it isn’t an “appropriate place for the city to legislate its affordable housing policy.”

But leaders and members at CTU disagree. Some of what the union is proposing includes more staff to support families in danger of losing housing and a program that financially helps school employees purchase homes.

About 16,000 Chicago Public School students are homeless, CTU President Jesse Sharkey said during a WTTW interview. Housing is relevant to the negotiation as CPS employees are required to live within city limits, but many can’t afford it, he said. Plus, other city employees like police and firefighters get housing assistance while teachers do not.

After a wave of teachers’ strikes, the cost of living and housing issues aren’t new to contract negotiations. In Oakland, California teachers cited skyrocketing rents as one of their main concerns.

A look into the Chicago rental market shows that the amount of affordable housing in the city is shrinking, even though low-income households represent the largest share of renters.

In Chicago, the union was also critical of massive development projects increasing rents and developers that avoid building required affordable housing by opting to pay a fee. The increased cost of living has led to a decline in student enrollment, especially among black families, CTU said.

""We are in one of the richest cities, one of the richest countries in the whole world, where tax payers have subsidized the development of sky scrappers but can not give black children on the south side a smaller class size"" @stacydavisgates spitting on the @CTULocal1 strike pic.twitter.com/tWhxuToQBb — agitator in chief (@soit_goes) October 16, 2019

Comparing the city’s massive breaks for developers against the stingy deals for Chicago students and teachers continues to be a main argument for CTU.

“The money is always there for places like Lincoln Yards and The 78. The money is always there to build bigger and better cop academies. But the money is never there for the very children that we say need it the very most,” CTU Vice President Stacy Davis Gates told WTTW.

Both these megadevelopments, Lincoln Yards and The 78, received in total $2 billion in tax-increment financing (TIF) earlier this year. CTU argues that developers don’t need that kind of assistance with infrastructure.

“Those TIF dollars belong in our schools, which have been robbed of those public funds for decades,” the union wrote in a July statement after learning that the city had raised an extra $181 million from TIF districts.",[]
https://www.texasmonthly.com/news/houston-aggressive-radical-plan-sell-affordable-housing/,['Houston'],"Houston Has an Aggressive, Radical Plan to Sell Affordable Housing","Houston’s reputation as a relatively affordable big city has taken a battering in recent years. Despite a downturn in oil prices, the real estate market has continued to set price records—to the joy of sellers and brokers, but to the dismay of buyers and renters.

Affordability has long been one of the Bayou City’s prime selling points. Houston may have been polluted, mosquito-infested, traffic-choked, swelteringly humid, subject to frequent biblical deluges, and overrun by gigantic flying cockroaches, but the houses were cheap. On paper at least, there were few better places to achieve the American Dream.

Not so much anymore. According to a Harvard University survey, Greater Houston’s 2017 home-price-to-income ratio of 3.7 is the highest it has ever been, and well above the “golden rule” of home affordability (that your monthly home payment not exceed 28 percent of your income).

The old adage “Drive until you qualify” is increasingly stretched to the point of absurdity when you consider that Houston—the city proper, plus the surrounding towns and the contiguous unincorporated sprawl of strip malls, feeder roads, parking lots, and housing developments—now fills the entirety of the land between the floodplains of the Trinity River to the east and those of Big Brazos to the west. It’s at those fringes, far-flung locales deeper and deeper in the Piney Woods to the north and the storm-wracked coastal prairies to the south, that you can still find three-bedroom, two-bath starter homes under $200,000.

It’s also in select transitional neighborhoods closer to the city center, where more and more often families find themselves beaten to the punch by institutional investors who transform properties into rentals or raze and replace them with townhouses.

Investors have long enjoyed a significant advantage over traditional homebuyers—namely, lots of cash. Now they’ve seized the advantage of time too. High-tech data-mining companies like Houston-based Entera can feed thousands of data points about a property, sight-unseen, into an algorithm in seconds and then market that property to an investor who can, and often does, buy it without so much as a drive-by. According to a recent Houston Chronicle article, Blackstone and American Homes 4 Rent, two of the country’s largest real estate investment trusts, work with Entera. Between them, the companies have purchased at least 5,800 Houston homes in recent years.

How can a traditional homebuyer—who spends hours upon hours poring over listings online, additional hours driving around, and hours more at open houses and showings—compete with that? Most often, they can’t—especially in the case of people on limited incomes in search of a unicorn of a first home. Entera likes it that way. “We hope we’re very hard to compete against,” the company’s co-founder, Robert Salmons, told the Chronicle.

Meanwhile, according to the Kinder Institute, a Rice University–affiliated think tank, nearly 306,000 Harris County households face severe problems (including a lack of kitchen or bathroom facilities, high costs, or overcrowding). Almost 215,000 Houston households spend more than half of their income on housing, and only eighteen affordable housing units exist for every one hundred extremely low-income households in the Greater Houston area, the nation’s third-worst ratio.

Given all that, the famously no-zoning, laissez-faire H-Town is enacting measures that would once have been considered unthinkable. Prominent among them was the formation last year of the Houston Community Land Trust, an independent nonprofit that has partnered with the city government to, in its words, “make affordable homeownership achievable for limited-income households in Houston, Texas.”

Here’s how a CLT works: Qualified homebuyers with an average monthly household income at or below 80 percent of the area’s median income (adjusted for family size) can buy a home from the trust at a below-market price. The homeowner gets a deed to the house and a 99-year, renewable, inheritable lease on the land, over which the trust retains ownership in perpetuity. The buyer must also agree to a cap on the property’s resale value—increasing no more than 1.25 percent annually—so that it remains affordable whenever it hits the market again.

The largest, and perhaps best known, CLT in America today is the Champlain Housing Trust, a Vermont organization founded in 1984 with the vigorous assistance of then-Burlington mayor Bernie Sanders. Texas’s own first community land trust, run through the Guadalupe Neighborhood Development Corporation, formed as a brake on gentrification in historically black and Hispanic East Austin. It built its first land-trust property in 2012, the year after the state enacted a property tax exemption for land-trust homes that made the arrangement even more affordable for potential buyers.

Houston’s plan calls for 1,100 homes to be built and sold before 2024—still just a drop in the bucket when it comes to addressing the city’s affordable housing crunch. The trust’s first offerings—six new three-bedroom, two-bath houses in the northwest Acres Homes neighborhood—are on the market for about $75,000 each. That price would result in monthly payments between $785 and $1,000, depending on the mortgage terms. One of the houses is already under contract, with the sale expected to close by the beginning of June.

HCLT’s executive director, Ashley Allen, was surprised by Houston’s dearth of cheap housing when she relocated from Chicago. “Even with a decent salary, decent credit, still my options were limited by income,” she said. “So that got me to thinking: If this is a struggle for me, what is it like for those who are making a little bit over minimum wage, or even those people who are making a decent salary, something like $35,000 to $40,000? The salaries are not keeping up with the rents.”

Imagine a family forced to move from apartment to apartment because rents go up 3 percent a year while incomes rise just one percent or less. Now picture that same family in an affordable home of its own year after year. Such stability does enormous good.

“When they go to look at homes, they’re wondering ‘What happened to the starter homes of yesteryear?’ In most cases those are now $180,000 to $200,000. So what does that mean for hardworking individuals and families?” Allen asks. “It’s either continue to rent, get a home that needs significant repair—which ends up costing you more money—or you end up getting placed out of your own community, which could mean away from where you work and where your family is. The people who’ve made the communities what they are don’t even have the opportunity to buy [there].”

For children, being forced to move means leaving the neighborhood entirely and having to start over in a new school. City of Houston Housing and Community Development director Tom McCasland says children frequently uprooted and relocated are at a distinct disadvantage from those with more stable homes.

“The education folks tell me that’s the single most important indicator in predicting whether or not someone will graduate from high school,” he says. “Anchoring a family to the community, that provides a benefit to the community, and that anchoring provides a significant benefit to the kids in the household by giving them the stability that they need through their school years.”

In central Houston, these problems aren’t limited to minority-majority neighborhoods like the Wards, but also artsy, predominantly white districts like Montrose and the Heights. Affordable apartment projects have been defeated by NIMBYish uprisings in prime Houston neighborhoods in recent years. The local aversion to such developments, even sparkling new ones for prescreened renters, approaches the level of phobia.

McCasland believes that the HCLT model won’t be met with a similar degree of fear and loathing. “Houston is a city of single-family homes, and we have a lot of them. It’s seen as an American Dream thing, and I haven’t heard the same sort of opposition to this program as we’ve seen regarding affordable apartments coming into certain neighborhoods, even if the residents of those homes are at the same income level,” he says.

In a city as geographically widespread as Houston, with famously lackluster public transit, the working poor can feasibly move only so far from job centers like the Med Center and downtown. So turning every neighborhood inside Loop 610 or Beltway 8 into townhouse-dotted, yoga studio-enhanced yuppie enclaves is not a wise option—not today, nor in the decades to come. Given that, Allen said, why not provide an opportunity for the working poor to stabilize their lives and build equity instead of leaving them at the mercies of the free market and ever-rising rents?

“This is a long-term tool that’s been in use for decades to stop displacement and gentrification,” she said. “Before people make a judgment on it, they need to educate themselves on it, look at the bigger picture, and figure out who it’s helping.”

In Houston, that’s everyone from service industry workers to city employees to first responders and teachers, some of whom are forced to get by on a single income.

“For that working mom who has an income that can carry a $75,000 mortgage on a three-bedroom home, this is a dream come true, if they can get that mortgage,” McCasland said. “They can give their kids that backyard they were looking for and be close to the school where they want their kids to go.”

So the American Dream, Houston version, may not be dead after all—flying cockroaches be damned.",[]

Another new apartment complex recently opened up in central Phoenix. But this project, called First Place-Phoenix, is unlike any other rental development.

The 81,000-square-foot, $15.4 million project was designed to support adults with autism in living more independently.

It combines 55 apartments, a residential training program and a leadership institute for medical professionals and researchers.

Residents ranging from their early 20s to mid 40s began moving into the four-story property at Third Street and Catalina Drive in July.

“It’s the best place,” resident Lauren Harper said. “I love waking up in my new apartment, going downstairs to get my coffee and heading out to work.”

More than half a million children and teens with autism in this country will become adults over the next decade.

First home away

For more than 20 years, Denise Resnik dreamed of a place her son Matt and others with autism could live as adults.

“We traveled everywhere looking for a model, but we were looking for something that didn’t exist,” Resnik, First Place AZ founder and CEO, said. “We realized it wouldn’t exist until we created it.”

First Place includes special security features, a 24/7 staff, sound barriers blocking out street sounds, nontoxic materials and special lighting to mitigate sensory issues.

The stylish, modern apartments also include convenient “grab and go” stations where residents can charge their phones and store keys in an easy-to-remember spot.

The game room with the Arizona Cardinals theme is popular with new residents. The apartments come with their own kitchens with high-end appliances, but the decked-out kitchen on the first floor is another spot many residents hang out.

Matt Resnik, baker and founder of SMILE Biscotti, knows his way around a kitchen. He will move in to First Place next month — his first home away from home.

Firsts at First Place

Denise Resnik said since July, First Place residents have been experiencing many firsts: First friendships, first time cooking on their own, first dates and first jobs.

“After more than two decades of researching and dreaming, it is awe-inspiring to see First Place-Phoenix buzzing with the activities of our first 32 residents and 24 employees,” Resnik said.

Some parents of the residents are also getting some firsts, including their first solo vacations without their kids.

“Before I moved into First Place, my parents were more nervous than me,” said Lindsey Eaton, a First Place resident and a member of its Council of Resident Engagement. “It means independence. It means the ability to do what I want, when I want, where I want and how I want.”

Annual tuition at First Place Transition Academy is $4,000 a month and includes an apartment, 24/7 support, utilities and classes at GateWay Community College. For apartments, rents start at $3,300 per resident for a two bedroom. That includes all the other amenities, except the college classes.

First but not the last

Phoenix was dubbed ‘the most autism-friendly city in the world’ by PBS NewsHour.

Sara Dial, First Place AZ board chair, said the community’s “overwhelming support” has led to First Place “leading the way with a new residential model for people with autism.”

It took decades of planning, research and forging community and financial partnerships to develop First Place.

“I want Phoenix to be the most disability-friendly city in the country,” said Phoenix Mayor Thelda Williams at the community’s opening ceremony last week. “Not only is First Place–Phoenix’s approach innovative, but it also brings hope.”

First Place was designed and developed to be replicated in other cities.

“I have this vision of a multifamily developer in Cincinnati, who sees the First Place blueprint and decides to build one there,” said Adam Goodman, CEO of Phoenix-based Goodmans Interior Structures, who donated furniture to the development. “That’s how First Place scales, by entrepreneurs taking risks.”

There’s definitely demand as 500,000 children with autism become adults in America.

—

In cities such as Boston, New York, and San Francisco, affordable housing is increasingly scarce. Across the United States, most lower-income households spend more than half of what they make each month on housing costs, according to “The State of the Nation’s Housing 2018,” a report from Harvard University’s Joint Center for Housing Studies.

But in Philadelphia, it’s not just a shortage of affordable housing that’s causing the crunch. Instead, poor-quality houses and an unusually high poverty rate — about 400,000 Philadelphians are living in poverty — tilt the equation so that demand far outstrips supply here, making affordable homes hard to obtain and difficult to manage.

To the uninitiated, the data in the Joint Center for Housing Studies’ annual report, released in June, might seem alarming. Among other statistics, the report states that affordable units for low-income renters both nationwide and in the 11-county Philadelphia-Camden-Wilmington region have become 50 percent more scarce over the last 10 years. The data point to a regional deficit of 117,132 affordable rentals.

At the same time, overall for-sale housing inventory in the region — as measured by a standard called months of supply— has dropped to 2.6 months, a historic all-time low, according to the report and data from real estate firm Houwzer LLC. Six months’ supply is considered balanced.

This hot seller’s market has contributed to higher prices. Home values in the city of Philadelphia alone have jumped more than 11 percent in the last year, to a median of just above $147,000, according to real estate search engine Zillow.

Observers intimately acquainted with the local housing market were quick to alleviate concerns the data in the Joint Center’s report might raise. (Most of the data break down only by the 11-county Philadelphia region, not for Philadelphia County specifically.)

Philadelphia is the most affordable city in the Northeast Corridor aside from Baltimore, said Kevin Gillen, a housing expert and economist at Drexel University’s Lindy Institute for Urban Innovation.

For housing to be considered affordable, the level of household income going toward costs such as mortgage payments, utilities, maintenance, and property taxes should be less than 35 percent, Gillen said. In Philadelphia, that figure hovers around 34 percent, just below the moderately unaffordable cut-off. For context, San Francisco and New York are in the 50 to 60 percent, or severely unaffordable, bracket.

How can Philadelphia be so affordable at the same time affordable housing is so scarce in the city?

“There are a large number of relatively affordable neighborhoods across the city… [but] we have a lot of housing that’s not affordable to a lot of poor people because they are in poverty,” said Alan Greenberger, the city’s former deputy mayor and a housing-policy expert at Drexel’s Lindy Institute.

Philadelphia’s poverty rate is 25.7 percent, the highest among the 10 largest U.S. cities, according to the Pew Charitable Trusts. The Joint Center for Housing Studies report defines extremely low-income renters as those making less than 30 percent of the area median income, which is about $26,000 a year in Philadelphia, slightly above the federal poverty line (which is just under $20,000 a year for a family of four). To be considered affordable for extremely low-income Philadelphians, then, average monthly rent should be about or below $650 per month.

Though his statement about unaffordability and poverty may sound like a semantic distinction, Greenberger argued that high poverty makes the problems here different from those of metropolitan areas like New York and Boston.

Affordable is a relative term, Philadelphia’s housing situation suggests.

Timothy Henkel, senior vice president of Pennrose Properties, one of the few private-sector affordable-housing developers active in the Philadelphia market, agreed with Greenberger’s conclusion. High poverty rates are driving changes in the affordable-housing equation across the country, but Philadelphia is feeling the squeeze more acutely than most, Henkel said.

Prospective homeowners need to take into account their savings and credit scores when considering a purchase. Without financial counseling, would-be buyers are often unaware of the types of homes they can reasonably afford, said Maureen Keown, a spokeswoman for the Philadelphia-based nonprofit financial-counseling service Clarifi. Some of the more affordable neighborhoods in the city include Grays Ferry and Port Richmond; Mount Airy, Graduate Hospital, and Fishtown are in the more middle-cost housing range.

The city’s elderly housing stock exacerbates the unaffordability caused by poverty, Gillen said. The median age of a house in Philadelphia is 93 years old — nearly thirty years older than the average median home age across the country, according to data compiled by the National Trust’s Preservation Green Lab. (The median is the middle number; half the houses are older, half newer.) So even if Philadelphians can afford homes, their quality is frequently substandard because the city’s housing stock is old and depreciated, Gillen said.

Many Philadelphia rowhouses were constructed as worker housing and were not intended to last for more than 100 years, Greenberger said — they need new boilers and electric systems, replacement for cornices that have fallen off, insulation, paint jobs, and other repairs.

Such properties are “naturally occurring affordable housing,” Henkel said, because they are privately held and affordable without income or deed restrictions. They need expensive repairs, and “there’s no math that makes sense… to take out a loan… and then turn around and rent [a unit] on the same level,” he said.

“We need to make reinvestments in these properties,” Greenberger said.

The cost of improving and reinvesting in old houses can lead to gentrification and displacement, however. Landlords face pressure either to raise rents or allow homes to continue their decline, Henkel said.

There are policy solutions that can ease the burden of gentrification, improve housing quality, and increase the rate of affordable-housing construction, Greenberger said.

But he added, “We probably need to do a better job as a city to make people aware of those programs.”

Among such initiatives are the Longtime Owner Occupants Program (LOOP) and the Real Estate Tax Deferral Program, according to information provided by Paul Chrystie, deputy director of communications for city’s Department of Planning and Development. Such programs allow homeowners without cash on hand to wait until they can receive the benefits of their property’s higher value before paying the necessary taxes, Greenberger said.

For example, under the Real Estate Tax Deferral Program, if the value of a homeowner’s property increases by more than 15 percent in a year, that homeowner may be able to postpone payment of taxes on the excess amount until the home is sold.

LOOP is an income-based real estate tax abatement for residents who have owned their homes for more than 10 years. If a property’s value increases more than 300 percent in a year, the homeowner may be eligible for the tax abatement, according to the information provided by Chrystie.

To help with housing quality, the city also has a Basic Systems Repair Program, Greenberger said. Under the program, homeowners with a maximum annual income of $37,650 for a family of four are eligible for free boiler and heating repairs, as well as roof replacement in some cases of major interior damage.

Renters are in a more precarious position, Gillen said. Without help from the city and state, it’s much more difficult for renters to avoid the effects of rising property values, Greenberger noted.

That’s where private-sector affordable-housing developers like Pennrose come in: They can build new units to meet the demand, if they take advantage of incentives provided by the state.

Those incentives include 4 percent and 9 percent tax-credit deals, Greenberger said. While 4 percent tax credits are common, they often do not provide enough revenue to be lucrative for private-sector developers. Nine percent deals are more useful but less common, he said. The tax credits allow developers to reduce their federal taxes once affordable units are put into service, and the developers can market the credits to investors, according to the Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency.

Zoning bonuses that encourage developers to allocate certain percentages of their projects to affordable housing are also often successful, but “these zoning bonuses tend to exist downtown… and produce small numbers of units,” Greenberger said.

For private-sector developers, “there are some barriers to entry, some of them real, some of them perceived,” Henkel said, calling Philadelphia a “high-cost environment” with construction costs that can often scare off developers.

Pennsylvania’s state government has done a lot in recent years to create resources for developers, including some increased funding of affordable-housing projects, but that has not meant a dramatic uptick in new players in the Philadelphia market, Henkel said.

“The state is doing better, but there haven’t been huge commitments to gap-fund new construction projects,” he said. “It’s just clearly not viewed as fertile ground.”

At the same time, Henkel is excited about the city’s future. Philadelphia has worked to create overlay zoning that allows upzoning with affordable housing, which creates more inclusionary projects. “Those will increase affordable-housing supply, and it will also increase it in places that might not have gotten any at all,” he said.

A hub of affordable housing, public green space, and a nonprofit justice center will spring up over several blocks in Chinatown in the coming years, pending approval of a project proposed by Pennrose. The affordable housing and justice center were included thanks to the city’s recent efforts to include social-impact criteria in the Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority’s requests for proposals, which give points to projects that meet those criteria, Henkel said.

“This was the first RFP where we included in our scoring a factor called social impact… and that means the developer has to give us a narrative where they explain what is the project’s social impact,” said Gregory Heller, who leads the Redevelopment Authority.

The Chinatown proposal was selected about a year ago, and Henkel said it could be approved by the Redevelopment Authority in the fall. Pennrose has hosted community meetings to discuss the finer details, and another meeting is scheduled for August.

The project, at 800-30 Vine St., is a small light in a dim sky, though — it exemplifies the mixed-use, community-focused affordable-housing mentality Henkel espouses, but it will offer just 55 to 65 units of senior affordable housing. It also will offer 160 rental units that are not designated affordable housing and are expected to rent between $1,500 and $2,200 a month.

A number of other planned developments offer similar numbers of units. The city will soon be cutting the ribbon for two new affordable-housing projects— Anthony Wayne Phase III and Centennial Village, Heller said. The projects will provide between 45 and 60 affordable units apiece; the wait list for a unit in Centennial Village is more than three years long.

Last year, the state awarded tax credits to developers for eight different projects across Philadelphia, but those will create only 475 additional units total in a region that, according to the JCHS report, requires an additional 116,000-plus.

The Redevelopment Authority, the Philadelphia Land Bank, and other city development organizations are trying to be conscious of affordable-housing needs when evaluating future development projects, Heller said.

And when the next recession actually hits, San Antonio’s housing sector could be one of the hardest-hit metro markets in the country, a new study indicates.

San Antonio shows up at No. 9 on a ranking by residential real estate brokerage Redfin of the major U.S. metro areas facing the greatest risk of a housing slump during the next recession. By comparison, Houston ranks 20th, Dallas ranks 22nd, and Austin ranks 25th.

In its study, Redfin looked at seven recession-related factors for each of the country’s 50 largest metro areas. They included volatility of home prices, share of homes that are “flipped” for investment purposes, and diversity of employers.

Each factor was assigned a different weight, and Redfin then calculated those percentages to determine a risk score for each metro. San Antonio’s was 63.2; the lower the number, the less risk there is.

“San Antonio’s housing market is at a high risk [in a] recession because home prices in San Antonio are quite volatile, and a high number of sales in San Antonio are flips,” Daryl Fairweather, chief economist at Redfin, tells CultureMap.

“Home price volatility puts a metro at risk because any downturn in home prices would be more extreme in a more volatile market,” Fairweather adds. “A high number of home flips puts a metro at risk because flippers would be the first to slash prices when the market turns down, unlike homes that are owner-occupied and can stay in place and weather an economic downturn.”

Grant Lopez, chairman of the San Antonio Board of Realtors, say he’s surprised by San Antonio’s appearance in the top 10, given that the region’s housing market stayed in good shape during the last recession, and the area’s population and economy are surging.

Still, Lopez says the Redfin ranking is no cause for alarm. During the Great Recession, which stretched from 2007 to 2009, the San Antonio home market saw the pace of home sales decline and the value of homes remain steady, he points out. Lopez expects the same pattern during the next recession.

“I always call San Antonio a very healthy market,” Lopez tells CultureMap. “I strategically use that word ‘healthy,’ because I don’t think we’re a volatile market like some of the other metros in Texas where they go dramatically high and dramatically low. We’re not a rollercoaster city.”

Lopez notes that San Antonio’s small inventory of million-dollar-plus homes — whose sales tend to lag during an economic downturn — helps shield it from wild swings in the housing market. In August, 93.7 percent of the homes sold in the area were priced below $500,000, according to SABOR.

Overall, San Antonio’s home market posted solid numbers in August, with the median home price rising three percent to $238,400 versus a year earlier and total sales jumping seven percent to 3,440, says SABOR.

“In San Antonio’s market, a recession does not mean panic mode,” Lopez says.

Redfin’s Fairweather encourages buyers and sellers of homes in the San Antonio area to approach housing decisions carefully during the next U.S. recession, which many economists predict will arrive in 2020 or 2021.

“If you’re a homeowner who doesn’t sweat mortgage payments and feels secure in your job, then a recession isn’t worth losing sleep over,” Fairweather says. “If you’re already looking to buy or sell, I wouldn’t recommend waiting for any major market changes. Buy or sell when you’re ready, but consult a San Antonio agent for crucial market insights.”",[]

SAN DIEGO (KUSI)- Like many big cities in California, San Diego is struggling with a severe housing shortage. In his”State of the City” speech on Tuesday night, Mayor Kevin Faulconer outlined his plans to spur the development of more housing.

“I want to radically overhaul the system itself,” Faulconer said.

In his address, the mayor presented a host of proposals. He called for eliminating height restrictions except in the coastal areas, to allow developers to build projects with more units.

Another proposal would remove parking requirements for properties located near bus and transit routes. Mayor Faulconer also suggested giving developers permission to build bigger projects with unlimited density as long as there are units set aside for homeless or low income housing.

The head of the industry group that represents San Diego developers said the mayor’s ideas may help ease the shortage, but in a city where the housing deficit is so deep, these measures may not be enough.

Borre Winckel, the president and CEO of the Building Industry Association said excessive state and local regulations have imposed prohibitive costs on developers, making it too expensive to build.

“Our regulations make up nearly one half of the total construction cost of the unit. California, has in essence, destroyed middle income housing by its zeal to regulate and regulate and put in more impact fees, thereby restricting the opportunity to build,” Winckel said.

The mayor also vowed to increase the number of affordable housing units in San Diego.

Ken Sauder, the president and CEO of Wakeland Housing, which has developed dozens of affordable housing projects in Southern California said the biggest obstacle is finding the money to build them.

“If we really want to tackle the problem in a real big way, we’re going to need to bring in more resources, especially locally,” Sauder said.

The mayor wants to make it easier for more projects to be green-lighted, without facing roadblocks from local planning groups. Even if housing developments do not need local approval, Sauder said developers will still need to meet with neighbors to help separate facts from fears.

“What we would do is we’ll sit down and talk with the neighbors anyway and hear their concerns and try to address them and go from there,” Sauder said.

According to estimates from the Building Industry Association, the city needs to build a minimum of 12,000 housing units every year to meet the current demand. At present, San Diego is building less than half of that total.

If the city doesn’t build more housing, Winckle had this forecast, “Unless we pay attention, we’ll be a city dominated by old folks.It will be a city that will ‘gray out’, a city that has sent away our young, our productive, our millennials, who on account of high housing costs say, ‘Adios, San Diego’.”",[]
https://www.dmagazine.com/frontburner/2018/06/why-dallas-lags-behind-the-new-urban-renaissance/,['Dallas'],Why Dallas Lags Behind the New Urban Renaissance,"This is the second in a two-part series in conjunction with D Magazine’s urbanism special issue that looks at how thinking around urban planning has created the city Dallas is today. The first can be found here.

By the mid-twentieth century, observers of the rapid changes that were unfolding in American cities began to recognize that the places that were being created did not reflect the ideals promised by the authors of the City Beautiful, Garden City, and Radiant City visions. For all their virtues and flaws, these imaginations of city life were supposed to enrich the quality of life of its inhabitants, allow greater access to nature and leisure, and introduce a higher standard of aesthetic pleasure in urban form. But many 20th century “urban renewal” programs only created urban blight, transforming cities that were once full of life into empty, dull, and dangerous places.

One of the most outspoken critics of “urban renewal” was Jane Jacobs, a writer and activist who, after helping defeat a planned highway project that would have demolished her neighborhood in New York’s West Village, published a landmark treatise on city life called The Death and Life of Great American Cities (1961). Drawing on close observations on how life in her neighborhood functioned, Jacobs argued that cities thrived when their communities were home to many uses that were shared by people who sought in them a variety of opportunities and services. Jacobs embraced the messy intermingling of people, places, and economic functions that modern planners had spent a half-century attempting to root-out. Crucially, Jacobs understood that the mid-century deterioration of cities was no accident.

“There is nothing economically or socially inevitable about either the decay of old cities or the fresh minted decadence of the new unurban urbanization,” Jacobs wrote. “On the contrary, no other aspect of our economy and society has been more purposefully manipulated for a full quarter of a century to achieve precisely what we are getting. Extraordinary governmental financial incentives have been required to achieve this degree of monotony, sterility, and vulgarity. Decades of preaching, writing, and exhorting by experts have gone into convincing us and our legislators that mush like this must be good for us, as long it comes bedded with grass.”

Jacobs was not alone. Other urban observers, such as writer William Whyte and planner Kevin Lynch, began conducting careful observations of day-to-day life in vibrant city neighborhoods and came to many of the same conclusions. But by the time that these critics began sounding the alarm, this new approach to city planning had already been enshrined in many codes, policies, governmental programs, and the attitudes and assumptions of city, regional, and federal planners.

In the 1970s and 1980s, riots, fires, surmounting crime, deepening segregation, expanding poverty, and general urban dereliction came to define the very loci of supposed “urban renewal” projects. Planners and bureaucrats saw this not as a failure of policy, but as its insufficient implementation.

Sun Belt cities proved effective at hiding the costs of the success of “unurban urbanization,” and in the 1970s and 1980s, Dallas emerged as a model of the kind of economic success government-subsidized suburban sprawl could generate. However, Dallas’ model of growth created its own problems. While residents migrated into the region’s northern suburbs in pursuit of bigger homes and better educational opportunities, those who remained behind struggled with degrading schools, rising crime, and entrenching poverty.

By the late 20th century, this pattern of expiration and neglect began to migrate outside of Dallas and into its inner-ring suburbs. The communities that were the first beneficiaries of decentralization were eclipsed by newer and more attractive suburbs.

The Counterproductive Decentralized City

This cycle is one of the peculiar, paradoxical characteristics of the decentralized city. On the one hand, the decentralized city seems to treat neighborhoods like the consumer economy treats commodified goods. Neighborhoods have a shelf-life. As they age and their initial appeal fades, they are discarded in favor of a newer “neighborhood-products.” Unlike neighborhoods in centralized cities, which become more desirable as they mature and stabilize over time, in the decentralized city, older neighborhoods are discarded as a kind of urban consumer waste.

David Halloran

But in other ways, the decentralized city doesn’t appear to follow the logic of a consumer market at all. As the tremendous rebound of urban real estate values in walkable cities like New York and San Francisco attest, the kinds of neighborhoods Jacobs, Whyte, Lynch, and others championed are highly desirable to many people. But if there is consumer demand for these kinds of communities, why haven’t developers met that demand by building new urban neighborhoods?

Over the past two decades in Dallas-Fort Worth, some developers have attempted to build more walkable, urban neighborhoods. But too often, developers seeking to build new urban neighborhoods are met with the complicated tangle of codes, policies, and financial regulations developed in the 20th century to support the growth of sprawl. These bureaucratic and political rules and assumptions have been sublimated into the inner-logic and administration of the decentralized city, making the production of a single, monolithic urban form the normative operative procedure of regional governance. Put simply, myriad administrative obstacles make it all but impossible to build good urban neighborhoods in Dallas.

And so today we have a situation in which, in the fourth largest metropolitan region in the country, there are hardly any neighborhoods that function like the kind of urban neighborhoods Jacobs and her cohorts championed. In fact, if you have lived in Dallas-Fort Worth your entire life and never left the region, you would have no real frame of reference to understand what kind of environment these writers evoke when they use the word “city.”

But most of us know what it feels like to be in these cities because they are the places we seek out in our travels. They are cities in which streets are filled with people; cities that can be explored and discovered by foot; cities that foster interaction, not separation; variation, not monotony; human connection and community, not dissociation and isolation.

And it is that disconnect between the cities we seek out and the urban region Dallas-Fort Worth has become that should provoke the greatest consternation among regional leaders. Despite Dallas’ long-held dreams of civic grandeur, the region has evolved into a place defined and entrapped by what architect and urban planner Andrés Duany describes as “the gravity of mediocrity.”

The Rebirth of the Great 21st Century American City

After witnessing the urban devastation of the latter half of the 20th century, architects, planners, politicians, and municipal bureaucrats revisited the writings of Jacobs and the other critics of urban renewal and began to rethink assumptions about what successful urban neighborhoods look like. At the same time, as the century drew to a close, new images of American life began reshaping public opinion, in part through television shows like Seinfeld and Friends. The allure of the suburban utopia was replaced in the popular imagination with idealized feelings of possibility and energy conveyed by images of life in urban neighborhoods. And the cities that still possessed these kinds of older, messier, multi-functional, pedestrian-driven, human scaled places began to thrive again.

But there was a problem.

Twentieth-century urban renewal had left many cities with few well-functioning urban neighborhoods, and in regions like Dallas-Fort Worth, hardly any at all. A rise in demand, coupled with limited supply, drove the real estate values of attractive urban neighborhoods through the roof. Along with increased financial speculation, the hyper-financialization of the real estate, and other pressures of an increasingly globalized economy, urban neighborhoods in cities like New York and San Francisco became economically unattainable for all but a few. Urban life, once associated with crime, drugs, and dereliction, emerged as synonymous with economic elitism. Gentrification and the economically driven displacement of residents from established neighborhoods proved nearly as disruptive and destructive as urban renewal.

But just as the suburban sprawl is not a deterministic outcome of the invention of the automobile, gentrification is not a necessary result of the desirability of urban neighborhoods. Rather, it is partly a symptom of a political and economic system that has largely eliminated choice from the neighborhood market. Even though studies have shown that upwards of 60 percent of Americans would like to live in neighborhoods that are walkable, where basic services are accessible without the use of a car, and which foster a greater sense of community, only a small percentage of the built environment in the United States provide this kind of urban experience.

Planners and developers hoping to reintroduce desirable urban spaces found it easier to accomplish in some cities more than others. The Danish architect and urban designer Jan Gehl helped to radically transform Copenhagen into a hyper desirable bike-and-pedestrian-centric urban playland in a little over a decade by redesigning streets and public ways that supported pedestrian and bicycle use. In New York, projects like the renovation of Bryant Park demonstrated how applying Jacobs’ and Whyte’s principals of scale and dynamic, cross-pollinating human interactions could turn what was once a crime and drug ridden no man’s land into one of the most beloved and well-used parks in the country.

But too often, planners seeking to return cities to human-oriented scale ran into opposition from entrenched bureaucrats, politicians, and stakeholders alike. The principles of the 20th century urban experiment had become established dogma, and many held tight to a belief that easily accessible free parking, fast-moving highways and streets, segregated commercial and residential districts, and limited density were essential ingredients to urban success. Zoning, building, traffic codes, and other policies restricted the kinds of building forms, densities, and streets designs developers and cities could provide. It became clear that, in order to change urban form, the rules of urban governance would have to be rewritten.

One such effort came in 1993, when a handful of architects and planners came together to form the Congress for the New Urbanism, which made one of its central prerogatives to draft a new building code that would simply allow cities to create the kinds of urban places people wanted but cities no longer had. The “Smart Code,” as the Congress for the New Urbanism called, was not a set of aesthetic ideals. Instead, it attempted to distill Jacobs’ and Whyte’s observations about how cities functioned into the language of governmental code.

It emphasized attributes like “walkability,” defined as having access to shops, restaurants, workplaces, and services within a 10-minute stroll from one’s front door. Neighborhoods were to be connected by a clearly defined hierarchy of narrow streets, boulevards, and alleys, all accented with high-quality pedestrian amenities.

A New Vision for the “Multi-Nodal’ Metropolitan Region

As Jacobs argued, good streets incorporate a mix of uses and diversity of functions, with blocks that contained shops, offices, apartment, and homes, and districts that included housing suitable for a variety of ages, income levels, cultures, and races.

Quality architecture is important to the success of urban neighborhoods but it shouldn’t be employed to justify the creation of largescale, monolithic superblock developments or uniform, monofunctional districts. Rather, buildings should offer a range of styles and prices, be situated in close proximity to each other, and older structures should be preserved alongside more contemporary forms. Density is vital to allow for walkability and economic vitality, but the planning of neighborhoods, districts, and towns should also carefully consider their overall structure. Highest densities are encouraged toward the center, with the entire district defined by an overall range of densities, ample public space, and discernable edges.

These principles of urban neighborhoods are not necessarily reserved for urban centers alone. Heavy government subsidization of sprawling super regions has created metropolitan areas that are expensive to maintain, inefficiently distribute economic opportunity, rely exclusively on automotive transportation, and contribute to environmental degradation and pollution. One way to overcome some of these shortcomings is to plan a greater diversity of mixed-density, mixed-use neighborhoods throughout the sprawl of massive super regions—a “multi-nodal” metropolitan region, a region defined by an interconnected network of dense urban areas.

City centers like Dallas, as well as many suburban towns and cities, could take advantage of the desirability and enhancing qualities of urban neighborhoods by reconfiguring their layout around clusters of urbanity that sit amid the wider expanse of suburb and exurban communities.

It is a vision of a region that would develop into a multi-nodal network of urban, suburban, and ‘edge’ communities, a decentralized city that is not defined and determined by a monolithic sprawl but is home to a multiplicity of smaller urban centers, each of which enhanced by the possibilities of strengthened community, stabilized economic value, and enhanced environmental sustainability. We have already begun to see what these new successful cities will look like: they are the places that reconnect with the fundamental qualities and efficiencies that are intrinsic to dense urban communities.

For 5,000 years, limitations in transportation and communication retrained the geographical shape and scope of cities. Today, technology has advanced to the point where human societies and economies can transcend most geographical limitations. The railroad and car began this process by accelerating mobility. Continuing advancements in communication networks, automated transport, and mediated and artificial intelligence will only expand the capacity to imagine new forms of urbanized society. In light of this, the urban experiments – and failures – of 20th century should provide a warning. The best cities are not designed by prioritizing the possibilities of technology, but rather by responding to human needs.

Today, urban planners and policy shapers who are inspired by Jacobs and her ilk are attempting to accomplish something that has never been attempted in human history: they are trying to shape urban environments that forgo the possibilities of technological potential in favor of focusing on more humanistic design considerations. Here too the urban experiments of the 20th century offer a lesson. The rapid upheaval in the geography of urban space was brought about by a wholesale rearranging of urban polices. The reversal of this system of development could be accomplished by a similar broad-based application of new ideas and principles.",[]

The council’s unanimous decision — sealed with celebratory hugs and applause from dozens of residents and environmental activists in council chambers — culminates more than three decades of development battles over one of Silicon Valley’s most desirable landscapes.

“Today we’ve announced a gift to future generations — a gift in the preservation of Coyote Valley for their delight and their inspiration,” Mayor Sam Liccardo said.

Coyote Valley has been considered by numerous big tech companies as a prime location for their headquarters over the years, including Apple in the 1980s and Cisco Systems in the 1990s. The land in North Coyote Valley, which is currently zoned for light industrial development, can accommodate 35,000 jobs, according to the city’s general plan.

But in both cases, environmental groups came out in droves to protest the projects and adamantly argued that the area — currently used by farmers and wildlife — should be left in its natural state.

The undeveloped land, which runs down the western edge of Highway 101 and abuts Bailey Avenue, contains the South Bay’s largest remaining freshwater wetland, offers natural flood protection for the city and forms a key connection that will allow wildlife — from mountain lions to deer — to move from the Diablo Range to the Santa Cruz Mountains, scientists say. It’s also home to numerous rare and endangered species, including the jewel flower, bay checkerspot butterfly, red-legged frog, western burrowing owl and tiger salamander.

The purchase, which is expected to be finalized at the end of the month, will not only protect the land from future development but also provide valuable flood protection for residents so that when Coyote Creek floods, water can fan out over the open area instead of deluging surrounding neighborhoods, as it did in 2017.

Walter Moore, president of the Peninsula Open Space Trust, said the council’s support for protecting the last undeveloped, flat valley in San Jose reflects “modern, smart growth”.

“San Jose is putting jobs and housing where today’s workforce wants to be rather than encouraging further sprawl, which leads to traffic, congestion and expensive city infrastructure,” Moore said.

But at least one resident in the audience Tuesday voiced concern over the potential loss of jobs in the area due to the deal.

Ken Saso, a 75-year-old Coyote Valley native, said he supported the land preservation in North Coyote Valley but wants the council to promise to keep the thousands of anticipated jobs in the southern section of the neighborhood.

“By not allowing development in Coyote Valley, all you’ve done is push people further and further south, forcing them to commute two to three hours a day,” Saso said in an interview after the meeting. “We need jobs where we are so we can reverse commute the traffic. ”

Under the deal, the city will pay $46 million, and the Peninsula Open Space Trust, a non-profit group based in Palo Alto, will pay $42 million to buy the property from leading Silicon Valley developers Brandenburg Properties and the Sobrato Organization. The Santa Clara Valley Open Space Authority also will contribute $5 million.

The city’s share for the purchase will be funded by Measure T, a $650 million bond measure approved by San Jose voters last November to upgrade emergency services, pave roads, build bridges and improve flood control. That measure, which was passed by 71 percent of voters, earmarked up to $50 million to preserve Coyote Valley.

When the purchase is completed, San Jose will retain ownership of 296 acres, and the remaining land will go to the Santa Clara Valley Open Space Authority, which will be responsible for managing and opening the land to the public.

Andrea MacKenzie, the authority’s general manager, said the council’s vote was just the first step toward realizing the full vision for the land.

The agency plans to begin offering docent-led tours for the residents in the next month, according to MacKenzie. Although the property currently doesn’t have trails, the tours will be held on the roads on the property, giving the public a chance to see the land up close and also offer their own visions for the site.

Once the land purchase is completed, the authority will lead a three- to five-year planning effort with public meetings to develop more detailed plans for the land, including trails for both hikers and bikers, areas for sustainable agriculture opportunities, restoration of creeks and wildlife tunnels and corridors under Monterey Highway.

“We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to protect and preserve one of the Bay Area’s most significant natural landscapes to benefit nature and people and to be a model for other municipalities and the state to follow using nature-based solutions to build resilience to a changing climate,” MacKenzie said.

Councilmember Sergio Jimenez, whose concept of open space while growing up in East San Jose was limited to the patio outside of his affordable housing complex, called this purchase ‘monumental and vital’ for the next generation.

“This is truly monumental and important,” said Jimenez, who represents the Coyote Valley area. “It represents another opportunity for kids that maybe can’t afford to go to places like Yosemite to have something nearby that they can visit and appreciate and begin to learn to love nature.”

Despite the region’s growing housing crisis, Liccardo said the preservation of the land played a key in the city’s effort to build affordable housing efficiently and effectively.

“We got into this mess of traffic congestion and inaccessible housing because we’ve been a sprawling valley for the last half-century,” Liccardo said. “This is our moment to change that dynamic by protecting our hillsides and open spaces from urban sprawl and focusing housing and development in the downtown core.”",[]
https://austin.towers.net/central-austin-development-roundup-new-views-and-new-towers/,['Austin'],Central Austin Development Roundup: New Views and New Towers,"Like almost every week, it was a good week for towers in downtown Austin. This time around, we got a look at an all-new development in the Rainey Street District, plus progress updates for a few other projects — not to mention some extremely fresh new renderings. As they say in the old country, “bada bing, bada boom:”

90 Rainey Street

Local developer and Urbanspace CEO Kevin Burns brought the Austin Business Journal a scoop yesterday afternoon outlining his plans to develop a 51-story mixed-use tower containing apartments (290 units) and hotel space (293 rooms) on a tract spanning 90-92 Rainey Street — properties currently home to Container Bar and Bungalow.

As seen in renderings of the building from architects Nelsen Partners, the project takes the unique step of integrating both of these bars into its design, wrapping around Container Bar and elevating Bungalow to a sort of niche on the second floor. It’s admittedly a little weird, but that’s a thing I’ve heard we’re supposed to keep Austin — plus, that Bungalow building is historic.

Joining the 44 East Avenue condo tower also planned with 51 floors on the opposite side of this district, it appears these projects — along with the Travis tower development destined for the former Villas site at 80 Red River Street, alleged to potentially be around 50 stories in height — are setting the new standard for height in the neighborhood, and we’ll be excited to keep track of them all as they move towards reality.

Speaking of the neighborhood — though we’re still getting used to the name, The Quincy apartment and office tower going up right next door to the 90 Rainey Street project is moving along, with fences up and excavation appearing imminent any day now. You can actually see a partially-transparent massing of the Quincy project in the renderings of this new tower:

There’s one more eyebrow-raising detail from the ABJ story on this project, related to the oft-speculated future of the Waller Park Place site a block away — emphasis ours:

Burns said he doesn’t expect construction to start until at least 2021. He said he wants his project to deliver near the same time as WeWork’s forthcoming office tower at Red River and East Cesar Chavez streets a stone’s throw away. Burns said WeWork is planning a tower of nearly 1 million square feet, though WeWork hasn’t released any details on its plans yet. — Austin Business Journal

Insert the googly-eye emoji here — that’s a lot of square feet, and implies that WeWork might be pursuing a development with similar scale to the massive three-tower complex previously considered for this site.

6 X Guadalupe

Though the timing of its actual construction still remains to be seen, we’ve got some impressively snazzy renderings we haven’t seen before of the 6 X Guadalupe tower from the architects at Gensler Austin. They’re probably the nicest ones yet.

Nothing new to report beyond that, except we’d really like to see this thing get moving. Bookings for the Extended Stay America hotel currently atop the future tower’s 600 Guadalupe Street property are still available through at least August, so we might need to keep being patient for a while.

Texas Capitol Complex

Though we’ve already covered the ins and outs of the Texas Facilities Commission’s ongoing project to transform the north side of the Capitol into a pedestrian mall with some shiny new state office buildings and thousands of underground parking spaces also in the mix, some new renderings out of the architects at Page give us an even better look at how this side of downtown will transform:

RiverSouth Financing

We learned yesterday that Austin developer Stream Realty Partners has secured $122.9 million in construction financing from the New York Life Insurance Company for its upcoming 15-story RiverSouth project in South Austin.

Though the demise of the Hooters at 425 Riverside Drive has experienced a slight delay, we now know that both the wing shop’s demolition and RiverSouth’s official groundbreaking will arrive next week at an event hosted by Stream on Wednesday, March 13. The building is still on track for completion in 2021.",[]
https://www.news4jax.com/news/2019/10/09/jacksonville-city-council-votes-to-shut-down-adult-arcades/,['Jacksonville'],Jacksonville City Council votes to shut down adult arcades sooner,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. – It was a vote as close as it could possibly get Tuesday night in Jacksonville City Council, and now, it appears adult arcades in Duval County must shut down almost immediately.

Under an ordinance passed by City Council in May, the businesses would have had to close their doors by Feb. 1. That changed Tuesday night, when City Council moved up the deadline.

Council Member Leanna Cumber argued that the businesses are a public nuisance, and that public safety is at risk.

""These are not safe establishments, and what they're doing is pushing out people who actually have businesses,"" Cumber said.

Members who opposed the bill didn't want to go back on their word from May in giving the businesses six months.

Mayor Lenny Curry told News4Jax during an interview on ""The Morning Show"" on Wednesday that he will sign the bill moving the timetable up, saying that the sheriff himself has communicated the public safety issues surrounding the businesses.

Members who balked at changing the timetable said they didn't want to hurt employees of those businesses, who would suddenly lose their jobs.

""How can we say people can have a choice of schools, but we're going to choose where people can spend their time? That's not on us,"" said City Council member Joyce Morgan.

When the council voted, the measure failed with 10 people voting against it. Council members said they were confused and the president had council vote again.

On the second vote, the bill passed 10-9. People who support the adult arcades said they're angry.

""Right before the holidays. You're putting everyone out of work,"" said Sabrina Zinc, who works at an arcade. ""What about Christmas? What about Thanksgiving? How am I going to provide for my family?""

Curry responded to her comment during his interview on"" The Morning Show.""

""You hate to see somebody that doesn't have a job, is not going to have income, but the fact is, these places have been public safety issues,"" he said.

Code enforcement and the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office will figure out how to make sure the businesses close once the bill is signed.",[]
https://www.curbed.com/2019/9/24/20881872/miami-park-underline-technology-civic-tech,['Miami'],The digital future of public space is taking shape in Miami’s new ‘smart park’,"Miami’s Underline, an ongoing $120 million project to transform the underside of a raised rail corridor into a 10-mile linear park, already seeks to be a transformative civic investment. But a new grant by the Knight Foundation may turn this revitalizing transit corridor into something new: a testing ground for civic technology.

Earlier this month, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation announced a $925,000 investment in The Underline’s technology infrastructure, which would include the hiring of a chief operating officer and chief information officer by the end of the year to help “create a technology master plan informed by residents and experts alike.”

“Technology will be the connective tissue that connects the people, places and activities within The Underline’s 120 acres,” said Meg Daly, founder of Friends of the Underline, the nonprofit that helped champion the idea of the new park. “We know technology offers infinite ways to improve this space and bring new ideas to life, but we have to build the foundation based on what’s available today and tomorrow.”

At a time when privacy issues in tech are paramount, and the prospect of a Sidewalk Labs-led smart neighborhood in Toronto is getting blowback, how would a park tech plan work, without raising data security issues?

According to Raul Moas, Knight’s Miami Director, the idea is to figure out, with the community, the best ways to apply technology as a layer on top of the new linear park.

“Security and safety are, of course, vital, but there are applications and use cases here that can drive better health outcomes,” he says. “We can use the park and technology as a canvas. Can you use technology to promote certain activities? That’s the question we have, and no other public space is out there right now asking those questions.”

The Underline seeks to redevelop open space under a span of Metrorail track roughly parallel to the north end of the Miami River. Moas described the projects as “covering up a scar,” replacing underutilized land with a 70- to 170-foot wide mobility corridor and greenspace.

In addition to pathways for cycling and pedestrians, the development, when complete, will feature amenities such as a dog park, outdoor gym and basketball court, waterfalls, butterfly gardens, a 50-foot long communal table, and a gaming table for checkers and chess inspired by similar, ad-hoc tables set up in the city’s Little Havana neighborhood. The first section of the park, Brickell Backyard, will open next summer.

Some might wonder, why ruin a new park—ostensibly a place to escape the digital tether of everyday life—with more technology? Does a park need to have an app?

Moas says that’s not the right way to look at it. This project and grant wants to engage with residents to figure out the best way to embed technology to enhance the park experience. It’s not about creating a digital dashboard measuring data. It’s about creating a civic commons that utilizes technology. Moas says that may mean tech that helps with curbside management and mobility, or ways to increase safety. But that’s low hanging fruit, he says, they want to go further. Perhaps there’s potential for a community fitness app, or a way to book and share public events.

“This funding isn’t meant to buy hardware or software, but to create a design process that brings residents in,” he says. “We should build this civic commons by, of, and for the public. It should look like the priorities of the community. It’s not tech for the sake of technology.”

While the initiative is in its very early stages, including filling the two roles funded by the grant, perhaps it’s best viewed as a promise to create a better process. Tech is ubiquitous today, even in our public spaces, so an effort to make it truly civic tech, designed by residents instead of a tech giant, is worthwhile.

“We think tech will play a bigger and bigger role,” he says. “We want to use this as a lab to experiment with tech and tech enablement. We want to optimize a public space through technology.”",[]

NPS announced the decision Monday, more than a year after the rules were originally floated in August 2018.

More than 140,000 comments about the proposal were submitted. “The National Mall and President’s Park are regarded as premier civic and symbolic spaces in our nation, and the volume and complexity of permit requests has increased dramatically over the years,” NPS points out in a release. “The intent of the proposed revisions was to maintain the public’s opportunity to hold special events and right to demonstrate while outlining clear parameters that protect the iconic landmarks, views and grounds for use and enjoyment of citizens and visitors from around the globe.” In recent years, requests for protest permits have increased.

In response to more than 140,000 comments received, the NPS announced it is withdrawing its August 2018 proposal to revise the First Amendment and Special Use Permit regulations for the National Mall, President’s Park and other DC national parks.

In a statement, Arthur Spitzer, the legal co-director of the ACLU’s D.C. chapter, said NPS “was wise to respond to the massive public objection to its proposed rules and to recognize that its primary responsibility is to the Constitution.” ACLU-DC organized against the idea, arguing it was unconstitutional and getting tens of thousands of people to submit comments.

Now, nothing in the existing regulations will change, per NPS. The federal government had also proposed restricting demonstrations at certain memorials, including the World War II Memorial, the Korean War Veterans Memorial, and the Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial, “to preserve an atmosphere of contemplation.” NPS said the fees would fund security costs.

https://nextcity.org/daily/entry/atlantas-schoolyards-to-become-after-hours-green-space,['Atlanta'],Atlanta’s Schoolyards to Become After-Hours Green Space,"Atlanta is proud of its trees. As of 2014, the city has 47 percent tree coverage, among the highest of major cities.

But Atlanta lacks public green space. Just under 6 percent of the city’s land is parks, and the city ranks 43rd among the nation’s 100 largest cities for its ParkScore, which measures how well cities meet the need for parks, according to the Trust for Public Land.

“Despite the fact that we’re the city in the forest and a very lush, green city, most of that lush greenness is privately held,” says Michael Halicki, executive director of Park Pride, a nonprofit to improve Atlanta parks. He says a third of Atlantans have to walk more than 10 minutes to reach a park.

But a new pilot hopes to change this with a straightforward idea: Opening schools’ green space to the public outside of school hours. Atlanta Public Schools is the largest land and property owner in the city, so there’s a lot of potential green space to be had.

“One of the highest costs for creating a park is land acquisition, and so here you have land that’s already owned by the public,” says George Dusenbury, Georgia state director at the Trust for Public Land. “It just doesn’t make sense — as we continue to get denser and the demand for green space increases — for land that is held by the public not to be available for more than one use.”

The Trust for Public Land, Park Pride, the city of Atlanta, Atlanta Public Schools and the Urban Land Institute Atlanta are working together on this pilot to open up schools as neighborhood green space. The public can use the space when schools are closed — after hours, on weekends and during the summer. But the pilot does more than unlock the gates. Based on ideas from the school communities and surrounding neighborhoods, each schoolyard will get an as-yet-unspecified upgrade.

In order to locate schools that would have the greatest effect on green space accessibility, the Trust for Public Land mapped out people who could walk to a school but not a park within 10 minutes. It then ranked the schools with the highest numbers of these populations, particularly in lower-income neighborhoods.

Earlier this year, Atlanta Public Schools invited 17 of these institutions to participate in the pilot that will open these schoolyards as after-hours parks. Ten schools expressed interest in being part of the pilot, spanning neighborhoods all around Atlanta.

Atlanta Public Schools extended the invitation to schools across the city — with a particular focus on low-income areas below Interstate 20 such as southwest Atlanta, says Rachel Sprecher, executive director of partnerships and development for Atlanta Public Schools.

“Everything we do, we look through an equity lens,” she says. “We like to offer opportunities to all our [schools], but we do have a special lens about maybe the schools in areas that need more resources that don’t usually have the opportunity to seize them.”

The first three pilot schools will be announced in May. Halicki says the schools will be in different geographic areas and have students from different income levels, since the pilot should be a learning opportunity.

After it chooses the three initial schools, Park Pride will further evaluate each site this summer. In the fall, it will hold meetings with the schools, students and surrounding communities about what they want to see in the spaces and how they want to use them.

“There might be ideas that go beyond our price tag, but that could actually be something that is actually written up and documented that gives people an idea of what the community liked and what they would like to see,” Halicki says.

Construction will happen in summer 2020, and the first three schoolyards will open that fall. All 10 schools will open to the public within three years.

For each school that opens to the public, the Trust for Public Land has committed to offering $150,000 of support in order to improve the playlots.

“We’re hoping that with this program and with generous philanthropy and external funding, we can maybe enhance some of the schoolyards, so whether that’s new playgrounds or upgrades or trails or things that maybe our general fund doesn’t cover or at least is not on the docket for renovation,” Sprecher of Atlanta Public Schools says. “We are hoping that these partners can bring some of those resources that can go towards those enhancements and then that will be more attractive and compelling to get the community to use the parks.”

What will be done to improve the parks will depend on community and school input, Sprecher says. But potential projects include an adaptive playground accessible to people with physical disabilities, walking trails, new playgrounds or learning gardens.

Park access is an equity issue, says Sharon Danks, founder and CEO of Green Schoolyards America, a national organization to make schoolyards more natural. Green spaces and parks tend to be in higher-income neighborhoods, so making sure schoolyards are accessible and green can help.

She says all school districts should do the type of work that the initiative in Atlanta will do.

“If we can green schoolyards across the city, then we are democratizing access to greenspace,” Danks says.

The Trust for Public Land has helped convert more than 200 schoolyards around the U.S. to be after-hours parks, including in Oakland, California, where it partners with Green Schoolyards America. If the Atlanta pilot succeeds, Dusenbury wants to replicate it in other Georgia cities. It would likely focus on the four other cities that have joined the organization’s national campaign to place parks within a 10-minute walk: Brookhaven, Clarkston, Decatur and Macon. All but Macon are in metro Atlanta.

Opening schools as green space can affect communities that are park deserts. Halicki says this creates parks for kids who live near a particular school but don’t go there or who don’t have space nearby in the summer.

It could also strengthen the ties between a community and its school. Halicki says perhaps neighbors will even pitch in to clean those schoolyards because it’s no longer just their local school — it’s their local park.

“We spend an awful lot of money on schools, including people who don’t have kids going to those schools,” he says. “This is a way that they actually wind up both getting some use out of those spaces but also a connection with those different schools as an anchor within their community.”

For the better part of the past three decades, Bostonians have forgone getting behind the wheel, opting instead to walk, bike or take public transit.

In a 77-page report released Tuesday, the city's Transportation Department unveiled plans to improve transportation and housing in Boston with a vision for 2030.

Among those goals is to see more people lacing up their sneakers and hitting the pavement.

About 14.5 percent of people who work in Boston walk to the office currently, far less than the 40.6 percent who drive themselves. By 2030, the city would like to see the percentage of people walking to work up by almost 50 percent and the percent of those who drive down by half.

While Boston has been ranked the third most walkable city in America in 2016 - behind only New York and San Francisco - city officials seek to improve their ranking in the coming years.

The North End is rated best neighborhood for pedestrians with a walkability score of 99.6. The neighborhood offers easy access to day-to-day needs, including to public transportation to other areas in the city. The South End, Fenway, Back Bay and Beacon Hill placed second through fifth, respectively, on the walkability ratings.

Neighborhoods further from downtown rely more heavily on public transportation and personal vehicles.

Officials seek to improve the percentage of city residents walking to their destinations -- and decrease the number relying on cars -- by improving access to reliable public transportation.

""Every home in Boston will be within a 10-minute walk of a rail or key bus route, Hubway station and car-share,"" the Department of Transportation report states as an aspiration for Boston in 2030.

About 43 percent of Bostonians currently live within a short walk to bus or train routes.

The city also intends to support mixed use development in neighborhoods as a means to see people walking, instead of driving, to buy groceries and other everyday goods.",[]
https://crosscut.com/2017/05/why-seattle-will-never-be-a-walkable-city-pedestrians-sidewalks,['Seattle'],Why Seattle will never be a walkable city,"People who walk regularly around Seattle are torn between bafflement and dismay at what they traverse on foot. On any given day, they encounter buckled, battered and sometimes closed sidewalks; broken curbs; faded or entirely unpainted crosswalks; and crumbling stairways.

Seattle is one of the richest cities in America. We are in the midst of the biggest boom since the Klondike Gold Rush, with developers pouring money into construction and residents’ property taxes climbing. How have we come to expect and accept so little?

Civic leaders talk about making Seattle a walkable city, but a full-on surge in walking is already upon us, and it's building every year, despite the deplorable conditions. The Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT) notes that walking is by percentage Seattle’s fastest growing share of the transportation modes. The number of people walking to work increased by 60 percent from 2009 to 2015. In Columbia City, some 65 percent of people visiting the business district get there by walking. Daily observation on the streets and sidewalks confirm statistics showing rapid growth in walking downtown.

To accomodate this walking boom, SDOT has written a big Pedestrian Master Plan to replace a largely unconsummated 2009 plan. SDOT advertises its plan, which is under review by the city council, as a 20-year blueprint to make Seattle the nation’s most walkable and accessible city. But help for walkers is not on the way.

The new plan actually sets the city’s course downward and backward. We'll see more years of inadequate maintenance while what we already have continues to fall apart. There is no vision for investing in areas where a combination of denser housing and job growth will further fuel the walking boom. There are no specific timetables for steps to relieve our epidemic of pedestrians being hit by cars.

Those we employ and elect should be, but are not, charting a path to the kind of city that pedestrians deserve.

Here are some of the ways in which the city's new plan mishandles pedestrian needs:

Neglected.

Seattle's network of sidewalks, marked crosswalks, curbs and curb ramps has a replacement value of $5.5 billion — more than a billion dollars above the value of all of SDOT’s bridges. But SDOT’s skimpy spending for ordinary maintenance on the existing pedestrian system hovers well under $2 million annually, or less than the department’s estimated cost to build just seven blocks of new sidewalk.

Shortchanged maintenance is made even worse by having to fork more and more of the maintenance budget into emergency repairs of a decaying system. The Move Seattle levy allocates only enough money to repair perhaps 6 percent of sidewalks over its nine-year course. According to a 2015 review by SDOT, the city might need 10 times what has been built into the levy just to forestall further deterioration of the existing system.

Move Seattle stipulates just $4 million over nine years for re-marking crosswalks. In 2016, SDOT marked 835 of its 5,500 crosswalks — the best in nearly a decade. But that was starting from a catch-up backlog of many hundreds, even thousands, of faded and often vanished crosswalks, many at high traffic intersections. And even if the city keeps up last year’s pace, it won’t come close to the four-year remarking cycle promised in the 2015 campaign for Move Seattle levy.

Forgotten.

Pedestrians’ impression: The system is falling apart beneath their feet. Astonishingly, citizen intuition has been the only measure of exactly how bad the situation has been allowed to get. SDOT has only scanty records, and those a decade old, of any systematic appraisal of actual sidewalk conditions. In its 2015 asset report, SDOT simply demurred that the actual condition of 70 percent of its sidewalks, curb ramps and the like was unknown. That startled even the City Council. So the council last year bestowed $400,000 on SDOT to thoroughly collect block-by-block sidewalk data in 2017.

The data will become available later this year, too late to inform the 20-year blueprint before the council. Today no one has any idea what it would cost to bring even fractions of the system up to snuff. Shouldn’t the council push the pause button so the plan can be connected to the critical data the council itself requested?

Missing.

Why didn't SDOT focus its new plan chiefly on fixing the sorry current state of affairs? That is because there lurks another problem: the big unhappiness in neighborhoods with no sidewalks. That constitutes a much noisier political issue than crumbling sidewalks. A quarter of Seattle’s blocks have no sidewalks. That’s 1,800 blocks on arterials, many with constant pedestrian use, and 10,000 blocks on non-arterials.

But here, too, the plan fails us. It touts a priority of filling in a third of the gap, about 3,700 blocks, for a very rough estimated cost of $600 million or more. Compare that to Move Seattle, which proposes to spend $61 million and build 250 new blocks of sidewalks. The notion that they are going to accelerate the construction so rapidly in the 11 years after Move Seattle is absurd.

The discrepancy isn’t within some margin of rounding error. It’s the utter disconnect between plan and reality. No wonder that SDOT’s plan actually footnotes: “Implementing pedestrian improvements ... in the [plan] will take major funding and many years of construction and will likely extend beyond the Plan’s horizon” of 20 years. In other words, grand blueprints with no expectation of how to pay for the work.

Misdirected.

What about the pedestrian dimensions of Seattle’s exploding growth? Meticulously mapped urban centers (like Downtown and South Lake Union) and two dozen urban villages (like North Beacon Hill and West Seattle Junction), show where the Seattle 2035 comprehensive plan strives to concentrate the city’s new jobs and housing. Over the next 20 years, the city anticipates adding 70,000 new housing units, 59,000 of which will be in these areas.

For urban centers and urban villages, walkability, accessibility and quality pedestrian infrastructure are supposed to be cornerstones of the city’s growth policy. But neither the mapped outlines of urban centers and urban villages, nor the 16 percent of the city’s land area now proposed for upzoning, made it into the plan’s geographic framework for prioritized pedestrian investment. Should there not be, at a minimum, some kind of data projection of where and by how much Seattle’s pedestrian activity will grow over the next five to 20 years?

Unlawful.

The growth outlook is not the only thundering silence in the new plan. It also skips over the city attorneys’s work on settling a federal class action lawsuit over the widespread failures of Seattle’s 27,000 existing curb ramps to meet the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Later this year, the veil will come off. We will learn how many thousands of curb ramps across the city — over how many years and how many tens, maybe hundreds, of millions of dollars — are going to have to be corrected so that Seattle will simply be accessible to all its citizens, in accordance with the law.

No one pretends today that the $30 million proposed spending in the nine-year Move Seattle levy aiming at curb ramps for 750 intersections is going to be nearly enough.

Unsafe.

In the last five years, about 35 pedestrians have been killed by cars in Seattle, another 200 seriously injured. In Belltown, a pedestrian was run down by a pickup truck and killed in a crosswalk last week. The trends are steady, not declining. Moreover, the risk of being a pedestrian-carnage victim is disproportionately high in Seattle for people over age 55.

But the plan offers no hierarchy among opportunities that would likely offer the biggest safety dividends, though that might seem to demand special urgency.

This much is sadly clear: SDOT’s new Pedestrian Master Plan has no serious claim to making Seattle the most walkable, accessible city in the nation. The plan simply reveals, by what it says and does not say, how Seattle’s pedestrians are gripped in deteriorating conditions and unsatisfactory trends.

The great loss is that it would be hugely worthwhile for Seattle to aim at being a much more decently walkable and accessible city than it is today.

That, however, requires earnestly engaging reality and the data. It means linking tangible goals directly to the city’s commendable urban center and urban village growth and housing policies. It means making hard choices to seize and advance strategies that will make the greatest positive differences. It means setting out schedules and responsibilities for action. And it means finding a bigger slice of the transportation dollar to make walking safer, more convenient and more useful for everyone trying to get around our city.",[]
https://hoodline.com/2018/08/san-francisco-s-biggest-walk-score-winners-and-losers,['San Francisco'],San Francisco’s biggest Walk Score winners — and losers,"If you live in San Francisco, you’re used to walking — often uphill.

Given its dense population and small area, San Francisco is America’s second most walkable city, behind New York City.

According to Walk Score, the company that calculates walkability, bikability and transit accessibility across the U.S., 45 of San Francisco’s neighborhoods are “Walker’s Paradises,” which means that daily errands don’t require a vehicle.

But as the city continues to add new bike lanes, transit routes and sidewalks, other neighborhoods are quickly playing catch-up.

We checked in with Walk Score to find out which San Francisco neighborhoods showed the biggest gains for walking, biking, and transit accessibility between 2016 and 2017—and which saw a decline.

Doing the Math

Before we get into which neighborhoods boosted their scores and which slipped, it’s important to understand how Walk Score calculates its ratings. They’re based on walking distance to amenities across seven broad categories — dining and drinking, groceries, shopping, errands, parks, schools, and culture and entertainment.

Each category is weighted differently, and the company also looks at average walk length and intersection density, to calculate pedestrian-friendliness.

The maximum number of points (out of 100) are awarded for destinations within about a quarter-mile — no more than a five-minute walk — of a particular amenity. Fewer points are awarded for amenities farther away, with zero points given for amenities more than a mile and a half away.

All of that information is then put through Walk Score’s proprietary algorithms, which in turn spit out a number value. The sum of those values is the Walk Score.

You can see those elements play out in the real-life scores. With a Walk Score of 99.97, San Francisco’s most walkable neighborhood is Chinatown, which teems with shopping, restaurant and school options. The similarly amenity-filled downtown/Union Square area comes in second, scoring 99.41.

An important factor to any Walk Score is what Walk Score spokesperson Aleisha Jacobson calls “depth of choice.”

“In each category, having more options is better than having fewer,” she said. For example, having two grocery stores is better than having one grocery store, and having five neighborhood restaurants will produce a higher score than three.

Up and Up

What causes a neighborhood’s Walk Score to jump? According to Jacobson, it’s a combination of factors.

“There are definitely neighborhoods that are making bigger jumps because cities are actively working to promote walkability and density,” Jacobson said. “They’re investing in neighborhood revitalization and planning communities around transit areas.”

When it comes to which San Francisco neighborhoods grew this year, the results aren’t surprising: three of the top five are in the city’s southeastern quadrant, where major building developments are underway.

Here are the five San Francisco neighborhoods that saw the biggest Walk Score gains from 2016 to 2017:

1. Hunters Point: 55.83 (+ 9.09)

2. Sunnyside: 78.72 (+5.94)

3. Treasure Island: 36.33 (+ 4.57)

4. Dogpatch: 90.60 (+ 3.91)

5. Presidio: 42.47 (+ 3.66)

Walking It Back

On the flipside, there are neighborhoods that saw a big Walk Score dip. According to Jacobson, this usually isn’t attributable to small factors like one or two businesses closing—although when a school or grocery store closes, that has a larger impact than when, say, a restaurant shutters.

“One or two businesses isn't going to cause the neighborhood score to drop drastically,” Jacobson said. “It tends to be a broader trend in a neighborhood as a whole.”

Here are five San Francisco neighborhoods that saw considerable Walk Score drops from 2016 to 2017:

1. Forest Hill: 59.92 (- 3.49)

2. Fairmount: 79.94 (- 3.00)

3. Crocker Amazon: 70.74 (-2.42)

4. Clarendon Heights: 57.82 (- 2.29)

5. Sherwood Forest: 50.99 (- 2.27)

Moving forward

If your neighborhood saw its score decline, don’t fret. Even though some neighborhoods see a dip in their Walk Scores from one year to the next, Jacobson says that the larger trend across the country is that walkability is on the rise.

“We have broadly seen walkability increasing in most cities and in most neighborhoods across the country,” Jacobson said. “Generally, the trend is for areas to become more walkable.”

https://detroit.curbed.com/2017/9/18/16320184/car-free-detroit-bike-public-transportation,['Detroit'],Everything you need to know about public transit in Detroit,"Welcome to Curbed’s first-ever Transportation Week! From how to improve public transportation in cities, ranking the best car-free neighborhoods across the country, and a friendly competition between NYC, San Francisco, and Los Angeles to determine which has the best public transit, this week is all about how we get around in our favorite cities. All aboard!

The streets of Detroit were built to accommodate a lot of cars. But as the city goes through another renaissance, the opportunity to better plan for public transportation—one of Detroit’s big weaknesses—should be part of a bigger discussion on where the city is headed. Curbed sat down with Trisha White, Detroit Revitalization Fellow and public transit advocate, who’s spent the last two years car free in Detroit and the previous 16 years car free in Washington D.C. We discussed traversing the city on foot, by bike, bus, and train, and what works and what doesn’t when it comes to public transportation in Detroit.

What modes of transit have you used in Detroit?

In my two years in Detroit, I have used every single manner of public transportation available: DDOT, SMART (both buses), Amtrak, QLINE (streetcar), Uber/Lyft (ride-hailing services), cab, People Mover (elevated rail), MoGo (bike share), and Megabus (intercity bus). But I bike or walk most of the time.

Which has been the most effective?

Since I live and work in Detroit, I can only speak for Detroit and not the ‘burbs. If you have deep pockets, of course you can Uber everywhere. It’s effective but it gets expensive. The next most effective has to be DDOT. For all its shortcomings, it’s the only system we have that runs citywide. People Mover and QLINE might run on time but that doesn’t help you if you need to get anywhere in the other 99.9 percent of the city.

Which has been the least reliable?

Sadly, that title also goes to DDOT. It’s getting better but still has a lot of room for improvement. Some days, the transit gods smile on you, the bus shows up, you get a seat and you get to your destination on time. Other days, you wait in freezing rain for 45 minutes, the bus is packed like sardines and you show up wet and late. Stuff happens, but transit shouldn’t be a daily crap shoot.

Stuff happens, but transit shouldn’t be a daily crap shoot.

What could Detroit learn from other cities?

Don’t worry about trains—that train has left the station. Look to other rust belt cities who have worked with what they have to improve mobility. Look no further than Grand Rapids for a great example of a modern, efficient, and reliable bus system. They have a smart card, they connect to the airport, and they integrate with other modes like vanpools and parking lots. AND it's used by all different kinds of people. If they can do it, so can Detroit. Light rail or BRT (Bus Rapid Transit) would be great but what if it doesn’t happen? We don’t need fancy, we just need reliable. Oh, and pay drivers a decent wage.

What have been the major difficulties in using transit in Detroit?

Lack of reliability is the killer. The industry standard is 90 percent on time performance but DDOT’s is between 60-70 percent.

Bus stops are also hit or miss. Some stops have nice shelters and some are just a sign on the side of the road. For my first 18 months, I waited at a bus stop at Eight Mile and Dequindre that was no more than a bent sign on a pile of garbage just three feet from 60 m.p.h. traffic. In winter, these become dangerous icy mounds of garbage just three feet from 60 m.p.h. traffic. This goes from inconvenient to hazardous for people with disabilities.

What do you think of the QLINE so far?

The QLINE is neat but it doesn’t really function like transit. When I think of public transportation, I think of moving people from home to work, shop, school, play, and then back home. Right now, only a handful of people can do all of those on the Q because we don't have the housing density near the line. Maybe over time that will grow, but for now it's just a fancy shuttle for Tigers games

Do you think residents need a car in Detroit?

I’m sure plenty of people have legit reasons to have a car. You do you. But if you live and work in Detroit, give car-free a try. If 26 percent of Detroiters live without a car, maybe you can too. Park your car for a month and get around on foot, bike, and bus. Use ride-hailing services sparingly but when you need to. While you’re waiting for the bus, do some back-of-the-envelope math on how much money you would save if you sold your car. Then make a list of things you would rather do with that money.

This subject is bigger in Detroit because the high rate of poverty runs smack into the prohibitively high cost of owning and insuring a car here. What if more Detroiters had reliable transit and could shift their car spending to investing in homeownership, health, education, or savings?

What do you think of current bike infrastructure in Detroit?

I'm always wowed by the amount of bike lanes—200 miles—in the Motor City. With the flat terrain, cool weather, and light traffic (compared to other cities), Detroit can be a bike paradise. Everyone should check out the new protected lanes on Cass Avenue. Once we teach people to stop parking in them, it’ll be the Cadillac of bike lanes.

Having said that, all the bike lanes in the world can't change how people drive. Even in bike lanes, you have to stay alert and keep your head on a swivel. Drivers aren't looking for you so you have to look for them. With car vs. bike accidents, it doesn't matter who had the right of way because the human on the bike is going to lose every time.

This is true in all cities, but Detroit is going through a weird learning curve with bikes and bike lanes. Drivers may not be familiar with how to share the road and many Detroit riders ride against traffic because they believe it's safer. Sadly, some leaders oppose bike lanes as harbingers of gentrification, only for the spandex crowd.

I'd also love to see more bike racks. I went to the Lions' opener and guards shooed me away from locking my bike on a fence. I spent 40 minutes looking and talked to three managers, none of whom could tell me where to park a bike at Ford Field. So a facility designed for 65,000 people was not designed for even one bike. Weird.

What advice would you give someone who's moving to the city without a car or a resident who wants to get by without one?

Jane Jacobs called it “eyes on the street”—the more people on the street, the safer they become.

Walk and bike! It’s by far the cheapest and most reliable transportation. You’ll also burn calories and get to know the city much better on the ground. And bonus—you’re making everyone safer by being out and about. Jane Jacobs called it “eyes on the street”—the more people on the street, the safer they become.

And just get on the bus. In so many other cities, public transportation is used by people of all ages, abilities and ethnicities, across all socio-economic strata. Everyone. For everything. It’s just how you get around and it’s normal. Here, there’s this ugly stigma and a glaring lack of diversity on DDOT buses. I can count on one hand the number of times I saw another white person on the bus. If you want to use your privilege to make it better, get on the bus.",[]

The pilot is beginning with four locations in north Minneapolis and will continue with additional locations in south and northeast Minneapolis later this year.

The City of Minneapolis has launched a mobility hub pilot programme to increase access to convenient, low- or no-carbon transportation options, including transit, shared scooters and Nice Ride bicycles – the local area’s bike-sharing service.

The three-month pilot programme will inform a long-term plan to implement a larger mobility hub network in Minneapolis. The city has collaborated with Metro Transit, Hennepin County, mobility service providers and neighbourhood organisations on the pilot.

Ambassadors from the city and partner organisations will be at the mobility hubs at select times to collect feedback and provide education on the transportation options. The hubs will be marked with a “Go” sign and feature street furniture, such as benches and wayfinding signs to points of interest, bus stops, and parking for bikes and scooters.

Currently, just 13 per cent of people in the Minneapolis take public transportation to their jobs, according to 2018 data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. About seven per cent walk to work, three per cent ride a bike and two per cent use other means, such as scooters, the survey found.

The city’s mobility hub pilot programme is supported by the city’s participation in the Bloomberg Philanthropies’ American Cities Climate Challenge, a two-year programme that provides cities new resources to tackle carbon reduction goals.

Lessons learned from both pilot programmes will inform work on the Minneapolis Transportation Action Plan, which is a 10-year plan to implement the transportation visions outlined in the Minneapolis 2040 Comprehensive Plan.",[]

Transit leaders appear ready to scrap their dream of building a light rail line connecting Pasco, Hillsborough and Pinellas counties in favor of a bus rapid transit system that would run alongside Interstate 275 from Wesley Chapel to Tampa to St. Petersburg.

Also known as BRT, the plan to bring that form of transit to the bay area is being drawn up by Jacobs Engineering, which was hired to conduct a regional study of premium transit options that can one day become a reality.

TAMPA BAY TIMES REPORT: Tampa Bay has one of the worst public transit systems in America. Here's why. (Feb. 16, 2017)

The plan will be unveiled to the public at the Jan. 19 meeting of the Tampa Bay Transportation Management Area Leadership Group (TMA), a group of political and transportation leaders from the three counties. But the planners said they could not discuss the details before next week's public meeting.

However, they've already started explaining the plan to public officials. Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn, Tampa City Council member Harry Cohen, and St. Petersburg Mayor Rick Kriseman said they were recently briefed on the 40-mile bus route that has emerged as the lead option from that ongoing regional transit study.

""This is a real, live proposal,"" Cohen said. ""This is the first time in a long time that we're going to have a real project with a blue print in front of us that we can sink our teeth into.""

Kriseman said he and other political and business leaders would still like one day to see a light rail system take shape. But the reality, he said, is that BRT is more affordable, easier to build and quicker to get up and running.

""Unless we are willing to ask the public to tax themselves significantly in order to make it happen,"" Kriseman said, ""then realistically light rail is really not going to happen.""

PREVIOUS COVERAGE: Long-awaited Tampa Bay transit study identifies five corridors for future transportation systems (April 22, 2017)

The buses are expected to have a dedicated lane for at least a majority of the route, allowing them to bypass regular traffic. And they might not even look like traditional busses, Cohen said, instead favoring smaller or more agile vehicles.

""I think the idea is to get vehicles that don't look like your standard bus, that have more of a rail feel to them, but the technology is still rubber tire,"" Kriseman said. ""So you're kind of combining the feel of rail with the cost and flexibility of BRT.""

That system would ideally be able to accommodate autonomous vehicle technology in the future. However, those details and many others, including the cost to build and maintain such a system, are still being worked out.

But while the specifics are still unknown, it's becoming more clear that an enhanced bus system, not a rail line, will likely be the first major regional transit project that Tampa Bay leaders pursue.

""The numbers don't lie,"" Buckhorn said. ""When you look at the cost and the ridership numbers and the likelihood of state and federal matches, I think it made a lot of sense.""

Buckhorn has long been a proponent of rail, particularly connecting urban areas, but said he wasn't interested in waiting any longer while people continued to debate the merits of a light rail line.

TAMPA BAY TIMES: TRANSPORTATION

Creating one transportation planning agency for all of Tampa Bay won't be easy (May 12, 2017)

Goodbye Tampa Bay Express, hello Tampa Bay Next; but toll lanes aren't going anywhere (May 22, 2017)

Elected officials and citizens have tried for decades in Tampa Bay to gain enough support for rail, failing most recently in Hillsborough in 2016 and Pinellas in 2014. Rail has also lacked support from local legislators.

""Candidly, I'm tired of talking about it,"" Buckhorn said. ""We need a victory ... I can say with a great deal of certainty if we move toward a BRT model using the existing interstate, we can get this done much more quickly than another prolonged debate in a political referendum about whether or not rail is appropriate for our area or not.""

The Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority has a plan to build a BRT system that would connect downtown St. Petersburg to the beaches, but the 11-mile route depends on federal funds coming through in the next few years.

The Jan. 19 meeting will see the third significant update in the regional premium transit feasibility plan, a cumbersome term for a process to identify specific transit projects that will best serve the region. It's all part of a 2½-year study, paid for with $1.5 million from the Florida Department of Transportation and overseen by the Hillsborough Area Regional Transit Authority.

Neither Buckhorn nor Cohen was surprised by the selection of BRT over light rail, but said they suspect some in the community might be. The last update from Jacobs in September listed a light rail line along that corridor as the leading option.

""I do think there may be people in the public who might be surprised that they didn't land squarely on a light rail project,"" Cohen said. ""They very much think its a good long-term play, as well as something that could be implemented quickly and more affordably than the other options.""

https://www.denverpost.com/2018/09/19/denver-considers-own-transportation-department/,['Denver'],"Looking beyond RTD, Denver considers creating own transportation department","Mayor Michael Hancock’s administration may move to create a new city transportation agency as Denver considers a transit investment that could total billions of dollars.

Denver officials have been talking publicly since 2017 about the idea of creating the new department. Now, the director of Denver Public Works says the decision could go to voters as early as May or November 2019, if elected leaders approve.

In the short term, the change could allow the city to better coordinate its efforts on transportation and mobility. It also could lay the groundwork for larger projects and changes.

The big idea

Currently, the city’s Department of Public Works handles everything from trash collection to automobile traffic and dockless scooters. The potential new department would take over all the city’s transportation-related duties, and it would be led by a new cabinet-level position, which would create new prominence for transportation issues in the city.

The change would have to go first through Denver City Council and then be approved in a local election. The decision comes as the city weighs long-term transportation plans that could cost billions.

The city’s plan for the next 22 years outlines about $1.7 billion worth of potential spending on sidewalks and trails alone. The administration also wants to build up transportation services on major corridors like Colorado Boulevard, whether it’s special bus lanes or new rail lines.

Moving beyond RTD?

Right now, the city relies on the Regional Transportation District for its bus and train service — but the city’s ambitions may exceed RTD’s budget.

Transit lines in Boulder, Golden and Aurora have all faced reduced service recently; RTD said the cuts were a response to low ridership. And a planned rail line to Boulder has been delayed past 2040. That has prompted some cities in the northwestern metro to consider a lawsuit, and Boulder also has looked at the idea of a new local transit authority.

In Denver, the creation of a new department would not necessarily come with new money. And the city is unlikely to replace RTD’s core services.

Still, the city has shown some appetite for transit spending, including for bus-rapid transit on Colfax.

“It’s not just the local governments. Everybody in town is looking at how transportation affects the quality of life of people,” said Kate Williams, executive director of the Denver Regional Mobility & Access Council, who is also an RTD board member. “Transportation has come right up to be on the same level of housing.”

Denver could get some new spending power from Proposition 110, a proposed increase to sales taxes that will be on the statewide ballot this November. If it passes, the city stands to collect $846 million over 20 years, according to projections.

With a new transportation department, Denver also could pay for enhanced RTD services, or to launch its own services, according to a city study.

RTD “seems open” to the idea, the study said, but the district was concerned that Denver could compete against its services.

“Based upon our excellent working relationship with the City of Denver, we do not have any major concerns with the plans we’ve seen and discussed,” wrote RTD spokesperson Scott Reed in an email to the Denver Post.

“While it would not make sense for any municipality to duplicate RTD services, supplementing RTD services with increased service and alternative modes is a very logical approach that can maximize everyone’s mobility options and transit investments.”

What’s next?

DPW Director Eulois Cleckley already has reorganized his department, separating out transportation staffers into a new chain of command.

Cleckley said at a recent meeting that Denver could ask voters to create a separate city department as early as May. November 2019 also is an option. The Denver City Council would decide whether to put the question on the ballot.

Other U.S. cities, including Oakland, Seattle, Charlotte, Pittsburgh, Portland and Washington, D.C., have local transportation departments.",[]
https://www.marketplace.org/2018/02/23/baltimore-subway-closure-snags-commutes/,['Baltimore'],Baltimore subway closure exposes deeper problems,"At the Reisterstown Plaza Metro station in Baltimore, loudspeakers were blasting WTTZ, the Maryland Transportation Channel. Yes, the Baltimore Metro has a radio station. But today, and for another few weeks, there is no subway service. On Feb. 11, the Maryland Transit Administration announced it would shut down the city’s only subway line for a month to make emergency track repairs.

Habib Malik, 64, stood on the curb, waiting for one of the free shuttles the MTA has arranged during the repairs.

“Getting back and forth to work is kind of difficult because we don’t know what time to come out here to catch the bus,” he said. He wasn’t even sure where the shuttle would stop.

Malik gave himself an extra hour for a trip that normally takes seven minutes. That morning, Dayshia Bunting, 20, was a half-hour late to her job at Burger King.

“They were understanding because they know the train is down right now, but I’m missing out on money,” she said.

Transportation headaches are nothing new in Baltimore. Last spring, the city revamped its bus system with new routes designed to be more efficient and reliable.

“We had the same exact problem, where everybody was confused, they didn’t know what bus to catch, and then they’re raising the prices on top of that,” Bunting said.

“What we’re looking at in Baltimore is systematic, gross, underinvestment in the transportation system,” said Samuel Jordan, president of the Baltimore Transit Equity Coalition, an advocacy group.

Even when the Metro is running, research from the Brookings Institution has shown that nearly two out of three jobs in the region can’t be reached by public transportation within 90 minutes. Jordan calls the uncompensated time spent on a bus stuck in traffic or waiting to transfer “transit detention.”

“Our calculations show that at minimum the economy is losing $325 million a year just in transit detention,” he said. “The burden is borne always by people of color, low-income and households that don’t have access to cars.”

The unreliable transit system is costly for workers and businesses, said former restaurant owner Jimmy Rouse.

“I ended up having to fire good employees who wanted to work because they couldn’t get to work on time,” he said.

Rouse helped found the advocacy group Transit Choices to push for a better system. He pointed to a 2015 Harvard study on upward mobility in the United States.

“It showed that the No. 1 obstacle for people rising out of poverty in this country was neither poor education or crime, but poor public transit,” he said.

Rouse said the new bus system will work better for Baltimore when the MTA installs GPS tracking and tackles worker absenteeism. When the subway line is working, it’s one of the more reliable ways to get around.

The agency has added dedicated bus lanes and is working on better enforcement, Maryland Transportation Secretary Pete Rahn said at a meeting with state lawmakers from Baltimore last week. It’s also coordinating service with large employers.

“We are making record investments in transit right now and we will continue to support those improvements,” Rahn said. “We’re very much aware that there are many people who depend upon transit as their mode of getting around.”

But the sudden subway shutdown has left those who rely on it, like Bunting in Northwest Baltimore, feeling neglected.

“This area doesn’t make a lot of money, so I feel like they tend to leave us out of a lot stuff,” she said. “They don’t really care.”

Along with the property, Riverside also will transfer to the transit agency federal restrictions that previously rested with the downtown bus terminal on Fairmount Boulevard.

When Riverside developed the downtown terminal in 1980, it used a $2 million federal grant that required the site to be used for transit. But officials have long planned to shift bus operations to Vine Street. RTA buses left the Fairmount site in January.

The nonprofit, which has been working for several years to develop a network of protected trails on existing city streets, has released a map that shows the general location of the proposed paths. They reach north to Fairground Park and Old North and south to Lafayette Square, Tower Grove and Cherokee Street.

Trailnet CEO Ralph Pfremmer said the trails would connect to a “spine” — the Chouteau Greenway — an east-west path being developed by Great Rivers Greenway that stretches from the Gateway Arch to Forest Park and Washington University. An international design competition is under way for the Chouteau Greenway.

“We intend to take the neighborhoods and connect them into the spine,’’ Pfremmer said. “The connectors are protected bikeways that are actually separated from the cars on the streets. We have a lot of capacity on our streets, and we want to use that capacity to make it safer to walk and bike in St. Louis, connecting everyone to the central city where the jobs are.’’

Determining the specific routes will require input from the public, Pfremmer said.

“And that has a lot to do with public engagement and looking through our lens of racial equity — looking to make sure that this project is equitable for everyone in St. Louis,’’ he said. “We’ll miss the mark if we don’t do that.

The project would also work with the Forest Park Great Streets project and bikeways planned by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, Pfremmer said.

Trailnet has looked at the eight-mile Indianapolis Cultural Trail as a model. That program has reaped economic benefits for Indianapolis, Pfremmer said. He noted that other Midwestern cities are also making strides with their urban trails, and it is important for St. Louis to keep up.

“The real story here is that we have so many people who have become educated on this concept, and they’re looking at these other cities and saying, ‘Oh my gosh, we’ve got to get on board.' Because the dividends are very distinctive. You see economic development. A better focus on public health,’’ Pfremmer said. “And then we look at the equity issues that we have in St. Louis and how we can provide a better method of mobility to the people on the north and south side.''

The Indianapolis Cultural Trail cost about $63 million, but Pfremmer said it is too early to estimate the cost of the St. Louis project. Trailnet is still studying funding options, but he believes it would be through a public-private partnership.

One hundred miles of bicycle lanes extended throughout Las Vegas 10 years ago. Today, there are about 500 miles citywide and an additional 200 miles in other parts of the Valley.

Car culture, funding restrictions on cycling infrastructure and the sprawling nature of the Valley have historically created challenges for urban cycling. But as Southern Nevada grows in population and road biking becomes more normalized, the region’s cities and Clark County are adopting more bike-friendly policies and infrastructure, albeit incrementally.

“We’re building it little by little,” said Marco Velotta, a senior management analyst in the City of Las Vegas’ Planning Department.

The efforts seem to be bringing more cyclists out of the shadows. The number of people carrying bicycles onto Regional Transportation Commission buses has been steadily increasing in the past several years, RTC data shows. In May, the agency counted about 56,000 bicycles on buses, and officials continue to observe “well-utilized” bike racks around the Las Vegas Strip, said Ron Floth, bicycle and community outreach coordinator for the RTC.

Cyclists range from children biking to school (particularly in more residential, higher-income neighborhoods) to millennials to aging baby boomers, Floth said. Some cycle primarily to commute, others for leisure and exercise, and others because bicycles are their primary or most reliable form of transportation.

“People [are] riding from transit to their final destination, which is work. We’re seeing quite a bit of that,” Floth said.

Within the city limits, affluent Summerlin seems to have the largest biking population and the most bike lanes, some of which were created by the Howard Hughes Corporation that owns and manages the master-planned community, according to Velotta. Also-affluent Henderson is similarly known for its high concentration of bike lanes and bike paths.

A major goal in the region now is to make biking as equitable as possible, in part by expanding bike infrastructure into all neighborhoods and communities.

“It’s one thing to make sure an area like Summerlin has facilities, and that’s important, but we want to make sure we hit places like Downtown and Wards 1, 3 and 5 in the center of the city,” Velotta said.

Changing the culture

Despite a growth in bike infrastructure and bike riders, cyclists and planners acknowledge that the region has a long way to go to protect cyclists and instill a share-the-road mentality throughout the Valley, especially among drivers.

“We still need to do more on the encouragement part and the enforcement part,” Velotta said.

Cyclist injuries and fatalities at the hands of drivers remain common; four cyclists have been killed so far this year in Clark County, according to the Nevada Office of Traffic Safety.

To reduce fatalities and collisions, many cyclists would like to see stronger enforcement of a Nevada law requiring drivers to maintain a three-foot distance from cyclists when passing them on the road. Although the three-foot law has been in place for years, drivers who hit cyclists (and therefore have automatically broken the law) still often get off scot-free, said Heather Fisher, president of the Summerlin-based bike shop Las Vegas Cyclery.

Many drivers don’t even know that the law exists, and lax enforcement doesn’t help, Fisher added.

“It just needs to be promoted through the DMV, through signage, or anywhere we can get the word out,” she said.

Fisher has lived and biked in the Valley since 1992 and now lives in Blue Diamond, a more rural and potentially safer enclave for cyclists compared with heavily trafficked areas such as Downtown Las Vegas.

Downtown, for its part, has some of the strongest cycling infrastructure in the area, including highlighted green bike lanes and access to the RTC’s bike center and bike share program. But cyclists often agree that it is still one of the most hostile areas, mostly because of the amount of vehicular traffic it gets.

“When you get into some of the more high-traffic areas closer to Downtown, people seem to be less [bike]-friendly. People are in a hurry, and maybe they don’t expect [cyclists] there,” said biker and North Las Vegas resident Mary Margaret Williams.

It’s a problem no longer unique to Downtown, as population and traffic continue to rise rapidly. Even though there are more cyclists on the road than there were 10 years ago, there are also more drivers, many of whom are more distracted than ever before, said biker Sean Tyrone.

“There are … more close calls, more accidents and more deaths, and 99% of them are because of driver inattention,” said Tyrone, who is also chief operating officer of Las Vegas Cyclery.

Tyrone used to commute for years from east Las Vegas to Green Valley. That bike route is a lot more problematic today, he said.

“I had a lot of close calls [before], but nothing like what I’ve seen and experienced personally in the last five years,” he said.

That’s not to say that growth cannot be accomplished in a way that helps cyclists, Fisher noted. For example, the Southern Nevada Regional Bicycle Coalition is pushing for developers to start including bike lanes whenever they build new housing. The City of Las Vegas’ 2050 Master Plan will also include a greater emphasis on multimodal transit, including cycling.

Funding for cycling infrastructure has always been a challenge when it comes to getting more bike lanes onto the streets. The Las Vegas Planning Department’s budget for bicycle infrastructure is still a tiny fraction of the rest of the budget, but it is becoming more of a priority, Velotta said. Other departments—such as Public Works, Parks and Recreation, and Operations and Maintenance—are also beginning to embrace cycling-friendly policies, he said.

“The fact that we’re including more and more buffer lanes, and that is now kind of the default, it just shows that there’s more of a commitment there to making complete streets possible,” Velotta said.

Pouring money into the issue isn’t a guarantee the region will become more bike-friendly, but if the money goes toward installing cycling infrastructure and signs, it can at least help drivers prepare to see cyclists and understand how to interact with them, Williams said. She acknowledged that cyclists must understand how to interact with drivers safely as well, something the RTC has been promoting through bike safety programs and educational workshops.

As a cyclist, the key to safety is to stay with traffic, utilize hand signals and use a bike light at night, which is required under Nevada law, Floth said. Although biking on sidewalks is permitted in most of Clark County with the exception of North Las Vegas, cyclists are safer when they act like motor vehicles and go with the flow, Floth emphasized.

“One of the things we talk to cyclists about all the time is to ride predictably,” he added. “That way, motorists know what they’re going to do.”

In the coming years, Fisher hopes that the region will recognize not only the health, environmental and recreational benefits of cycling, but also how becoming a cycling city could propel Las Vegas into the future.

“You go to other cities and there’s bike lanes everywhere and bike paths everywhere,” Fisher said. “They do that to attract the newer, younger tech-y job market to their cities, and to diversify. And that’s what we’re going to have to do here.”

Planners seem to have a similar vision.

“We’ve come considerably far over the past decade,” Velotta said. “We really have seen a physical transformation as a result. But we still have a lot of work to do.”

Known for being eco-conscious and independently-minded, Portlanders have historically fought big road-building projects in favour of more local solutions - resulting in an excellent public transport system and world-class cycling infrastructure. That means you can explore everything Portland has to offer ­- from its famously gorgeous parkland to more than 70 local breweries - on two wheels. Keen bikers will love Portland - and Portland will love them.

This summer, discovering Portland by bike is a cinch for Londoners, thanks to the launch of the first ever non-stop air link to the UK. Here are five of Portland’s many cycle-friendly innovations you can now easily experience for yourself.

The people’s bridge

Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines

Tilikum Crossing, known as the bridge of the people, opened in 2015. Closed to private cars, it is for the exclusive use of cyclists, pedestrians and public transport. Use it to get from the west side of the Willamette River to the Eastbank Esplanade, which offers a shore-side cycle with scenic city views.

The SE 17th Avenue Multi-Use Path

This new hiking and biking trail helps cyclists ride easily from the busy inner-city to the more laid-back communities in the south. It connects two existing bike paths - the Springwater Corridor, which heads from south-east Portland to Powell Butte Nature Park, and the Trolley Trail, tracing an old streetcar line between the historic towns of Milwaukie and Gladstone. It’s great for getting off the beaten track.

Downtown cycle lanes

Even cycling in Downtown Portland is painless, thanks to wide, green dedicated bike lanes and road rules that are favourable to pedallers. For this reason, an organised bike tour is a brilliant way to get to know Portland, and operators offer everything from historical rides to beer and food-focused itineraries.

Biketown bike-sharing

You’ll see bright orange bikes parked all over Portland - there are 1,000 of them available at 100 stations dotted about the city, as part of the Biketown bike-sharing scheme. With eight gears, real-time GPS and responsive lighting to keep cyclists visible, the bikes are ideally suited to urban riding and cost as little as $2.50 to rent.

Ride and fly

Portland is so pro-cycling that even the airport caters to pedal power. PDX offers bicycle parking and a dedicated bike assembly and repair station, with tools provided, so people can disassemble and reassemble their bikes pre- and post-flight. There is even a multi-use path that starts at the airport and connects to a regional trail system. Ride, park and fly!

Phil Hardberger Park became a reality after San Antonians in 2007 voted to approve a bond issue allowing the purchase of additional land for public parks.

A new report confirms what many residents have known for years: San Antonio has a parks problem.The Trust for Public Land's annual ParkScore Index ranks San Antonio 72 out of 100 of the nation's biggest cities in terms of its public parks. Last year, it landed at 67 The index ranks cities' parks by accessibility, acreage, investment and amenities. While the Alamo City scored a 75 out of 100 in the acreage category, it earned less than 50 in each of the three other categories.Its worst score, a 15, was in accessibility.According to the Trust for Public Land, just 42% of San Antonio residents live within a 10-minute walk of a park, which is lower than the national average of 54%.Part of the problem, as we have pointed before , is that the city didn't keep up with developers' largely unhindered development of suburban sprawl. So while SA has some enviable public spaces like the River Walk and Brackenridge Park, they're largely centered around downtown.Only recently did big bond issues allow the development of assets like the sprawling, multi-ecosystem Phil Hardberger Park. However, the Trust for Public Land's report suggests we have a lot more catching up to do.",[]

An estimated 14 percent of the San Antonio population lives with a disability, according to census data from 2011-2015.

Meeting and interacting with new people outside one's everyday network can be a struggle for anyone, but is even more trying for individuals with mental or physical disabilities. Limited services and a lack of awareness or understanding widen the opportunity gap.

Socialization of a child, for example, is typically a natural phenomenon, but for kids developing on a different pace, making friends and forming relationships can be challenging.

Employees with disabilities may have a more difficult time adjusting to the workplace. Limited transportation options make it harder to maintain contact with family, friends and support networks.

A nearly year-old plan to dispatch a fleet of electric buses — with comfy seats and wireless internet access — that run down Interstate 5 from Redding to the Sacramento International Airport is moving forward.

But this North State traveler's dream appears to be in for a bumpy ride.

First off, it's not certain that electric vehicles with the battery range needed to complete the two-and-a-half hour trip exist, according to Shasta Regional Transportation Authority Director Dan Little.

""Making that whole 175-mile trip on a single charge is ... putting it right to the limit,"" he said. ""Technology's changing fast, so five years from now, it probably wouldn't be cutting edge, but today it is.""

The $8.6 million grant the agency received is earmarked for only electric vehicles to service the route.

The SRTA's grant is part of $2.6 billion that was awarded last year by the California State Transportation Agency for similar projects across the state. The grants are funded by gas taxes through Senate Bill 1 and proceeds from state cap and trade auctions.

The SRTA received bids from interested bus makers earlier this week and will select the winning bid at its board meeting on April 23.

That's just the beginning of this road trip.

It could still take up to two years for the company that's selected to build and customize the clean tech bus fleet to deliver the vehicles to Shasta County.

With the time frame for electric buses so far away, the agency is considering a back-up plan.

As an alternative, the agency has proposed to run a bus service from Redding to Sacramento International Airport on I-5, with stops in Red Bluff and downtown Sacramento.

That line would use the very diesel-fueled vehicles that now take train passengers from Redding to Sacramento's Amtrak station.

Currently, only train passengers can ride that ""bus bridge"" service. It runs along Highway 99 with stops in Chico and other cities, but not Sacramento's airport — potentially a major transportation draw.

Ridership of the existing ""bus bridge"" service is thin. Only about 20 passengers daily use the current Amtrak bus service, according to SRTA's estimates.

SRTA estimates the new service — which would be open to all riders, not just train passengers, as it is now — would carry more than 58,000 riders each year for its first two years.

If all the various parties currently involved in the existing Amtrak ""bus bridge"" reach an agreement for the SRTA takeover, getting the interim service up and running still wouldn't happen for six months to a year, Little said.

As part of the proposed stop-gap agreement, the SRTA would have to find a private operator to take over the existing portion of the route that connects Chico to the Amtrak station in Sacramento, said Jennifer Pollom, SRTA senior transportation planner.

Once the electric vehicles arrive, the SRTA could then revert to its original plan to link Redding, Red Bluff, Sacramento and the Sacramento airport for all riders with its all-electric bus fleet.

Little remains hopeful the various agencies involved will approve the interim plan to get the Redding–Sacramento International Airport bus line running until the electric vehicles are delivered.

The agency received $8.6 million in 2018 to launch a fleet of seven electric buses linking Redding to Sacramento and connecting some other North State cities to the line.

""We've heard a lot from the public and they really want to see the service happen sooner, not a year from now or two years from now, which might be the case if we're waiting for the electric buses,"" he said.

""We don't think it makes sense to wait that long when we can fix that existing service that's here now,"" said Little. ""We would just focus on the I-5 service, like we've always wanted to do.""

https://www.govtech.com/fs/automation/Orlando-Fla-Sees-the-Launch-of-Its-First-Driverless-Bus.html,['Orlando'],"Orlando, Fla., Sees the Launch of Its First Driverless Bus","(TNS) — With a fitting beep, doors opened and out stepped local elected officials and executives as confetti rained down over them outside the driverless bus.

The battery-powered driverless shuttle — operated by the mobility company Beep — had safely delivered them to the official opening of the free service, which will shuttle daily between the Laureate Park Village Center and Lake Nona Town Center. The route of about a mile will take about 12 minutes, toting 10 people at 15 mph.

“Tomorrow is here,” said Rasesh Thakkar, senior managing director of Tavistock Development, which created Lake Nona.

Jérôme Rigaud, chief operating officer of the French company Navya that built the bus, hopes drivers and passengers grow to find the technology boring and a regular part of life. He pitched its safety to skeptics by asking how quickly drivers pick up their phones when they sit down in a vehicle.

“When they say it’s boring, that’s a done deal,” Rigaud said.

As driverless vehicles begin to take hold in pockets worldwide, concerns have grown about their safety. In Arizona, an Uber autonomous vehicle struck and killed a pedestrian, while a Navya bus was involved in a crash in its first day of testing in Las Vegas.

While the second crash grabbed headlines, the National Transportation Safety Board investigated and determined the truck driver was at fault, the Washington Post reported.

Proponents of autonomous vehicles argue they’re safer than manned vehicles.

The opening of the shuttle, if proven successful, could be crucial toward reaching goals of the region. Central Florida was deemed an autonomous vehicle proving ground by the U.S Department of Transportation.

Orlando Mayor Buddy Dyer has spoken of eventually getting the technology downtown in its LYMMO circulator buses.

“I don’t see that happening in the next year or so, but we’re certainly working toward that,” he said. “We want to embrace technology. We want to be known for that.”

Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings, meanwhile, could see it used to shuttle visitors around International Drive and the Orange County Convention Center.

Over time, Demings said he anticipates the buses will be able to take on more of the region’s transit burden. They’ll grow in size and be able to travel farther and on more advanced routes.

As he pursues a 1-cent sales tax for transportation on the 2020 ballot, he said he suspects autonomous vehicles will play a role.

“As fast as we’re growing, with as many tourist visitors as we have in this area, we have to do a better job of efficiently moving people throughout the community,” he said.

In all, two shuttles will operate from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 6 p.m. to 10 p.m. Tavistock expects to deploy more shuttles and more routes.

The existing route connects residents near the Laureate Park Village Center to a popular downtown restaurant district where Bosphorous Turkish Cuisine, Park Pizza & Brewing Co., Boxi Park and Chroma Modern Bar + Kitchen are located.

The vehicles are air-conditioned and have 10 chairs. They have also an attendant who doesn’t drive the bus but can intervene if need be using an Xbox controller.",[]
https://la.curbed.com/2019/8/15/20807275/los-angeles-commute-times-traffic,['Los Angeles'],Number of LA residents dealing with commute times over 90 minutes surges,"In Los Angeles County, where residents deal with demoralizing congestion and not-so-reliable public transit options, more than 150,000 people now spend 90 minutes or longer commuting to work in each direction.

That’s according to a new report from Apartment List, mined from census data, that focuses on a nationwide increase in so-called “super-commuters,” who spend upwards of 15 hours each week traveling to-and-from work.

Such employees have long been a staple of the East Coast workforce, where the downtown cores of cities like New York and Washington, D.C. draw in commuters from far-flung suburbs every weekday morning. Such long commutes are rarer on the West Coast, though the study suggests that may be changing.

As sprawling as Los Angeles may be, its share of super-commuters—now about 3.6 percent of the total workforce—is only slightly higher than that of the entire nation (2.9 percent). But commute times are growing quickly for many workers.

Between 2009 and 2017, the number of LA County residents with commutes longer than 90 minutes increased by nearly 30,000—a 22 percent spike. Those numbers include trips by car or on public transportation. Neighboring Orange County saw a 29 percent bump in super-commuters over the same time period, and in Riverside County, the number of super-commuters rose 31 percent.

Apartment List analyst Chris Salviati, who authored the report, tells Curbed that many of those facing long commutes in other counties are likely traveling to-and-from Los Angeles for work.

“Both Riverside and San Bernardino counties have super-commuting rates that are among the highest in the nation,” he says. “I think the vast majority are probably commuting [to LA] by vehicle.”

In Riverside, more than 7 percent of workers are now classified as super-commuters. San Bernardino isn’t far behind, with a super-commuter rate just over 6 percent.

Salviati explains that because many of these workers are likely traveling by car, these additional vehicles could worsen traffic congestion, which in turn makes shorter trips take longer.

“Infrastructure plays a big role here,” he says. “As a Metro area grows, if it doesn’t accommodate that growth with appropriate infrastructure, then traffic compounds and commute times are going to increase even for those living [near] the urban core.”

Higher levels of congestion also make it more difficult to get around efficiently using public transportation. In LA, buses that share lanes with private vehicles make up the bulk of the county’s transit system. When traffic is bad, buses are more likely to show up late, and riders transferring to other lines may miss their connections.

In a recent analysis of local bus speeds, UCLA lecturer Juan Matute found that vehicles in Metro’s system traveled 12.6 percent slower in 2017 than they did in 1994.

Salviati suggests that some super-commuters in LA County may not be traveling far distances; they could just be transit-riders faced with multiple transfers and the traffic-producing effects of urban sprawl.

If that’s the case, reducing commute times could be a matter of adding bringing more residents closer to the county’s major job centers.

“I think this really speaks to the need to rethink how we let our metro areas grow,” Salviati says. “When an area’s got a strong economy and is adding a lot of jobs, that’s a good thing. But then when you’re not adding enough housing in the right places to keep pace with that demand, that’s when we get into these issues.”",[]

Online auto parts retailer AutoAccessoriesGarage.com compiled U.S. Census Bureau data from major cities across the country and found that Chicagoans spend 32.4 minutes commuting one way between work and home. Double that, and the average person in Chicago spends more than an hour each work day either behind the wheel or on a crowded CTA train or bus. If you spread that out over the course of a year, Chicagoans who work five days a week spend just over 280 hours commuting to and from work annually.

Compared with other U.S. cities, Chicago finished just ahead of Philadelphia (31.2 minutes) and New York (29.5 minutes). Miami and Los Angeles rounded out the top five with average one-way commute times of 29.5 minutes and 28.9 minutes, respectively. Nationwide, the average commute takes 25.5 minutes, according to the report.

Drivers in the Houston metro area will spend more time commuting to and from work in 2019 than the average American, according to a report from EducatedDriver.org.

In the Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land metro area, drivers spend 29.5 minutes a day on one-way trips and 59 minutes on round trips, the report says. Researchers project Houstonians will spend almost 10 full days (9.95) commuting this year. Meanwhile, the average American will spend only 7.4 days making the same trips.

The report's calculation begins with the average person working a five-day work week, which amounts to 260 days a year. Researchers then subtracted about 17 days for how long the average person spends on vacation per year (based on a 2018 study). Lastly, researchers used average daily commute data from the U.S. Census Bureau for nearly 1,000 cities around the country to make their projections.

Commuters in Texas' other major metros fare better than Houston, but not by much. According to the study, Dallas-Plano-Irving will spend 9.41 days getting to work and back home, whereas Fort Worth-Arlington will spend 9.31 days on the road. Austin-Round Rock residents will spend 8.9 days commuting, and San Antonio-New Braunfels will spend 8.67 days making the same trips.

PITTSBURGH — America’s storied “Steel City” is on the forefront of an energy revolution, transitioning from its long reliance on fossil fuels to renewables and energy efficient homes. In June, Mayor Bill Peduto joined an alliance of over 100 cities committing to solar and wind power. The announcement came only hours after President Trump made known he was ending US involvement in the Paris agreement, a 195-nation pledge to fight climate change by dramatically reducing carbon emissions. Trump said he “represents the citizens of Pittsburgh not Paris.” Mayor Peduto, the same day as Trump’s speech, assured the president that the city “will follow the guides of the Paris Agreement for our people, our economy and future.”

Environmentalists and climate scientists are united: we must take climate change seriously and reduce carbon emissions by diminishing our reliance on fossil fuels. But a pattern is emerging in Pittsburgh as it has elsewhere: neighborhoods depressed by one collapse or another renew themselves, then outsiders come and price out locals. Inequality’s many manifestations—housing biases, segregation, gentrification—has forced low-income people into polluted neighborhoods for decades and, even as we reshape our cities to prepare for the new future of energy, are threatening to do it again.

Going green, staying poor

In downtown Pittsburgh’s Waterfront building, Larry Schweiger, is among those happy to see the Steel City embracing change. Schweiger is welcoming, deep-voiced and, like a kindly professor, given to tangents about his upbringing in Western Pennsylvania and long career in environmentalism. Schweiger is the CEO of PennFuture, one of dozens of local non-profits helping the city transition away from steel and fossil fuel dominance.

“There’s a deficit of jobs in manufacturing and blue collar fields. I really respect people’s frustration over that,” Schweiger says. “But that doesn’t mean we have to reverse our environmental commitments or that we don’t move forward on them. The biggest job creator in Pennsylvania right now is clean energy.”

“Trump’s pulling the plugs out of everything.”

The clean energy industries provides 66,000 jobs in Pennsylvania, according to a 2016 report from BW Research. While solar and wind have both shown historic growth recently, according to the report, 80% of Pennsylvanian clean energy jobs are in energy efficiency, updating and restoring the state’s many historic buildings to make them more sustainable. Pushing businesses and homeowners towards energy efficiency and renewables could boost job growth even further, in addition to putting the city on the path toward its 2030 goal of powering all municipal buildings on 100% renewable energy. But Schweiger explains that, top to bottom, the hurdles are numerous.

Anything boosting clean energy over traditional sources contradicts the Trump administration’s coal-revitalization messaging; the GOP budget calls for eliminating the federal energy efficiency program. (“Trump’s pulling the plugs out of everything,” Schweiger muses.) Municipal support is also precarious, he explains, because legislative hurdles surrounding building codes means energy efficiency isn’t mandatory in the city. Businesses may not want to foot the bill for it.

“We need to look at it from all angles,” Schweiger says. “That’s [not] the way so many decisions have been made and they’ve been made poorly. Because we’re not looking at how it impacts our neighbors, how it impacts future gens, how it impacts the world at large. “

But the problem of saying “we”—either a larger, global “we” or the policy community Schweiger refers to—need to do something is that not everyone can. Because the final burden, the one for most residents, is the simplest: money. In most cases, residents need to own their home before doing invasive work like re-figuring insulation or having panels installed, if they can even afford it. And in a city still recovering from the fallout of steel’s decline, those who would benefit the most from energy efficiency and cheaper energy bills from solar can’t afford it. Even in an energy transition, being poor is still expensive.

A 2016 report from the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy found that low income Americans typically spend more of their annual income on energy bills than higher earning households. This only becomes more pronounced if the household is predominantly Black/Latino or if the house itself is rented instead of owned. In Pittsburgh, half of low-income households spend twice as much of their income on energy bills as higher earning households.

Sighing, Schweiger recalls one woman in such a home, poorly insulated, sweltering in hundred degree heat, plugging her AC into extension cords overnight.

“It overheated, caught fire and she lost two children in the house as it burned to the ground... It really brought it home for me,” he says. “Here’s a person that’s trying to keep her home cool in an overheated world. And she doesn’t have the resources to make that house less expensive to operate. I think those are the kinds of problems we’re gonna see more of down the road if we don’t address these equity issues.”

Transitioning to renewable energy has clear potential to reduce pollution and even save lives, but what does it matter when those who need it the most can’t afford it?

Greenification, gentrification

20 minutes away, Millvale is the city’s most public clean energy success story. A series of floods nearly ruined the former mill town, first in 2004 following Hurricane Ivan and twice following heavy rains in 2007. Already struggling with high unemployment and, despite requests, little financial support from officials in Pittsburgh, local residents rebuilt the area. With a series of grants from sustainability foundations, they converted an abandoned electronics repair shop into the local library, now equipped with solar panels and a fully functional garden. Restaurants and coffee shops sprung up, sourced from food grown just around the corner and staffed by Millvale residents. Now, the borough receives regular national acclaim from city planners, clean energy companies, universities and sustainability orgs.

It’s a feel good story and one that Millvale’s sustainability coordinator, Zaheen Hussain, repeats often. By building a new sustainability system that harnesses the excitement for clean energy, but centers on equity, locals remained in control as it bounced back from the floods. Born in Bangladesh before immigrating to the US as a child, Hussain is a spokesperson both for Millvale proper and the need for a “fair” clean energy transition.

“Another tour?” a local smirked as we pass a local diner.

“It’s a place where you can be young and make a mark,” Hussain explains. “In my field, if I were to try and go work [in Boston or New York], I’d get plugged into a system that was built ahead of my time.”

Millvale’s development followed the highly regarded Ecodistrict Pivot Plan. The plan sets dozens of guidelines, from setting caps on housing prices to ranking prospective businesses on sustainability and prospects for hiring locally, and building community land trusts, which prioritizes building new communal spaces, like a garden to ease the stressors of being a food desert or a community center for job training.

Key to Millvale’s success, Hussain says, is making equity a pillar of its Ecodistrict plan. The borough’s rising profile has attracted multiple moneyed sustainability stakeholders. But without what Hussain called a “shared vocabulary,” residents aren’t on equal footing with the would be developers trying to transform their community. As a dark mirror to Millvale’s efforts, in nearby Lawrenceville, similar green-centered efforts are instead uprooting longtime residents.

“Lawrenceville is like Pittsburgh’s Williamsburg,” he begins. “10, 15 years ago, you’re walking down the street, you’re seeing active drug deals. Today, the housing market—some houses are probably worth 500 times what they were back then. I’m not even joking. Really great for the economy of the town. Also, pushed out a lot of people.”

According to statistics taken from the Allegheny County Department of Human Services, there were 1,502 arrests in Lawrenceville in 2005 and only 502 arrests in 2015. Crime is largely a function of poverty. And while it’s decrease is remarkable, the city hasn’t eased stressors on the poor, but displaced them. A local report on the neighborhood’s growth says it now “has almost nothing left that’s affordable for the middle class, either to rent or buy.” In the same report, the city’s real estate and planning manager said nearly one-third of residential properties since 2012 have been bought by outside companies, not Lawrenceville citizens.

As locals complained, Pittsburgh’s overall affordable housing and world-class technical breakthroughs from Carnegie Mellon and U Pittsburgh drew the attention of tech magnates like Google, focusing on machine learning and engineering, Uber, testing out driving-cars on local roads and Amazon, all with offices in the area. As was the case in Detroit, New Orleans, Brooklyn, etc., with this nascent tech boom came new developers pushing a version of sustainable neighborhood transformation that rose rents and pushed out longtime residents.

“People sometimes come over here and see what’s happening [and say] ‘Oh, Millvale. It’s the next Lawrenceville.’ And it’s like curse words. People in town do not want to hear that. That is not what we want.”

The dynamics between gentrification, displacement and sustainability are subtle and shifting, but in an industrial city like Pittsburgh, which the American Lung Association ranked among the nation’s worst in air quality, neighborhoods making strides in air or water quality are pushing low income people out of their own neighborhoods and nearer to highways crossing the city, where diesel trucks spew black carbon and near industrial plants where housing is cheapest.

A 1983 report from the Government Accounting Office found that minorities were more likely to live near pollutants like landfills. So did a 1987 report. And a 2007 report. And one last year. An inequitable clean energy transition is not only oxymoronic, it defeats its own purpose and functions the same as any form of inequality. If the clean energy transition isn’t fair or equitable, if it actually forces poor people into areas with worse environmental quality, then what really transitioned?

Rural problems

Sharing an office with Hussain in Millville, a former social hall called the Moose Lodge turned sustainability headquarters, Dr. Kirk Jalbert is a data visualization expert with FracTracker Alliance, a research group tracking fracking and pipeline development. Jalbert spent years studying citizen science and environmental justice movements, particularly around water monitoring in rural areas. Having seen both the power of grassroots environmental campaigns and the skepticism they draw from institutionalized scientists, he sees the power imbalances within well-intentioned environmental spaces. The rural people who make up most of the state get left behind.

“If we were to do a wholesale shift to renewables, how does that disrupt areas that are already very poor and already impacted by fossil fuel industries?” he asks. “If a coal mine shuts down, then people are impacted. And then, does that exacerbate crime issues? Does that exacerbate drug issues? Does that exacerbate domestic violence issues?”

“If we were to do a wholesale shift to renewables, how does that disrupt areas that are already very poor and already impacted by fossil fuel industries?”

In much of rural western Pennsylvania, coal mining communities are what Jalbert calls “mono-economies.” Coal jobs are the only jobs. Shifting to renewables without a plan for what will happen to people in these economies could be disastrous. Retraining them for clean energy jobs, should they choose them, is expensive and would likely require relocating. But coal mining is a largely generational occupation: most miner’s fathers were miners. That would mean families are essentially forced to leave communities they’ve been in for decades, yet another green-powered displacement. But because coal country backed Trump overwhelmingly in the election and generally support the GOP narrative that Obama-era regulations killed steel and coal, their pushback to a hasty transition out of coal is read as regressive climate denial. It’s complicated.

“We’re not being forward thinking about how do we also alter our social and political relationships as we think about economic transitions away from industries we thought were injustice-making,” he says. “These are just as injustice-making.”

Transitioning off fossil fuels will always be a collective effort, but Millvale’s success came from demanding equal footing with new stakeholders. Resolving the imbalances embedded into the fossil fuel system is paramount to a genuine transition. There are no easy solutions, neither energy nor home ownership have ever been equitable in this country. But, a neighborhood under transition should educate and encourage neighborhood education, demand communities well as commercial investment, and think longterm about affordability and efficiency.

An inequitable transition shifts alternate power sources—wind and the sun for coal or gas—but maintain the imbalances that trap people in cycles of unemployment, environmental harm and a lower quality of life. It hurts both the rural and urban poor. While Jalbert supports championing renewables in the city, he thinks the transition isn’t extensive enough to reverse damaging social inequities embedded in the fossil-fuel based economy.

“This isn’t just a matter of shifting the needle a bit left or a little bit to the right,” he says, “we need to completely rethink our institutions [if] we want to actually take these issues seriously.”

Otherwise, the transition to reduce carbon emissions will accelerate inequality.

https://observer.com/2018/02/los-angeles-atlanta-miami-and-san-francisco-are-running-out-of-water/,[],These American Cities Are Running Out of Water,"Capetown, South Africa, is running out of water. Sometime in April, it will face “Day Zero,” which means that the city’s taps will be turned off and its four million residents will have no access to water. Civil unrest, riots or worse aren’t just a possibility—they are inevitable unless there is a very quick fix.

The country is rushing the construction of water treatment plants and of desalination plants to harvest drinkable water from the ocean, but these solutions should have been implemented years—even decades—ago.

Other Cities Are Drying Up

Capetown isn’t alone in racing toward an uncertain fate. All across the world, major cities are seeing their water resources shrink at an alarming rate. Tokyo, London, Cairo, Sao Paulo, Beijing and Mexico City are facing the prospect of an arid future. Each is from a different climate and on a different continent, but they all may share the same fate.

Cairo has been plagued by desertification and instability in irrigation, but now it has to do so with more mouths to feed and water. Sao Paulo gets even more rain than the U.S. Pacific Northwest, but the water isn’t drinkable, thanks to pollution. Beijing can no longer sustain its water supply as glaciers in Tibet are receding even faster than expected. Mexico City was once built on a lake, but there’s no place for the water to go thanks to construction on water recharge zones. Such activity also makes the area unstable and worsens the destruction from deadly earthquakes. Despite all of its rain, London’s problems stem from a growing population. Tokyo gets as much rain as Seattle, but a lot of it comes during the brief monsoon period, and a weaker rainy season due to climate change could leave the Japanese city high and dry.

Which Cities in America Could Face a Similar Fate

These water problems are not just struggles experienced by non-Americans in a distant land. They are concerns that U.S. citizens will face here at home, with just as much intensity as South Africans, Egyptians, Brazilians, Japanese or English. It will be Texans, Floridians, Georgians, Californians and residents of Utah who will face a dry future without immediate action.

5) Texas Cities: El Paso, San Antonio and Houston

Six years ago, I stood in the Rio Grande, on the border of Texas and New Mexico, just outside of El Paso. It was completely dry, but leftover bones of a few fresh water creatures eerily indicated there had been a river. It was nothing like the river I had grown up with in the 1970s and 1980s that formed the famous border between the U.S. and Mexico.

Roughly 100 years ago, a congressionally approved project known as the Elephant Butte Reservoir was completed in Southern New Mexico that allowed water to be diverted from the Rio Grande for agriculture. In the 1930s, Colorado, New Mexico and Texas worked out a deal, with Congress’ blessing, to share the water. But with the Rio Grande running dry, Texas recently sued New Mexico, claiming that the state is violating the deal by draining additional water before it ever gets to El Paso. Oral arguments were heard by the U.S. Supreme Court last month on this subject. Meanwhile, the Rio Grande isn’t so grand, thanks to such water diversions.

Two other large Texas towns are in trouble. San Antonio has relied upon the Edwards Aquifer, but the growth in population and a lack of recharge could use up this valuable resource. And sure Hurricane Harvey flooded Houston, but that’s not drinkable water, thanks to the region’s dependence on petrochemicals and related industries. Even though Houston was built on a swamp, overpopulation and building on watershed areas could make this city another dry and dusty Texas town.

4) Salt Lake City

The capital of Utah is fast becoming a victim of climate change. As NOAA’s Cooperative Institute for Research in the Environmental Sciences put it, “For every degree Fahrenheit of warming in the SLC region, a 1.8 to 6.5 percent drop in annual water flow of local streams could occur.” And for a Western city dependent upon cool temperatures to generate snow and fresh water, those elevated temperatures are bad news.

3) Atlanta

Ten years ago, Georgia faced a crippling drought. West Point Lake was nearly classified as a “dead pool.” Many Atlanta lakes nearly suffered the same fate. The rains eventually came, but the city has never fully recovered from those days, though Mayor Shirley Franklin helped the city upgrade its sewage system. Its water supply is tied up in courts, as the result of a water dispute between Georgia, Alabama and Florida. A bad decision in the courts could make this Southeastern city resemble the Atlantis of old.

2) California Cities: Los Angeles and San Francisco

California is facing its worst drought in recorded history. Los Angeles is struggling with the the depletion of the Colorado River by several states for agricultural purposes. San Francisco is dealing with historically low rainfalls. But overall, the state’s population boom is creating a crisis for the state. But the main problem both cities face is that California is too reliant upon weather to provide water, and there too many water districts to create a coherent policy.

1) Miami

You would think a city by the coast like Miami would be flush with water, but saltwater can’t be consumed. Moreover, those rising sea levels are seeping into the city’s aquifer. As the waves lap over city streets, the city’s freshwater supply could disappear as fast as a hurricane headed to Florida.

Which U.S. Cities Are Solving Their Water Crisis

The news is not all bad. A number of U.S. cities had the foresight to realize that unlimited supplies of water do not exist and that America’s population is growing rapidly. These cities can provide lessons for those municipalities that are struggling to provide enough water for their citizens.

The city that has done the best is right in the middle of the desert. Years ago, Las Vegas instituted a rigorous water conservation system that’s becoming a model for other U.S. urban areas. Dallas and Austin have engaged in similar ways of preserving water that other Texas cities like El Paso, Houston and San Antonio need to follow. And Boston and New York City haven’t waited for problems to emerge before taking action.

Water is like an economic entity in that there is supply and demand. But unless problems are addressed with both, people will pay a heavy price for inaction. Whether it is boosting supply by utilizing creative technologies and protecting wetlands and watersheds or reducing demand by engaging in conservation methods, all need to be employed to avoid a “Day Zero” like Capetown might soon experience.",[]
https://www.wcpo.com/news/insider/why-no-large-scale-recycling-of-food-waste-in-cincinnati,['Cincinnati'],Why no large-scale recycling of food waste in Cincinnati?,"CINCINNATI -- It's enough to make you think twice before you put those moldy strawberries in your garbage can.

According to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, more than 38 million tons of food waste were created in the United States in 2014, with only 5 percent of it diverted from landfills or incinerators. More food reaches them than any single material in everyday trash -- food comprises about 22 percent of discarded municipal waste.

With so much benefit to be gained from diverting organic waste from landfills, local environmentalists are looking at ways to make that happen in Cincinnati.

Perhaps the Queen City could learn something from Seattle, Washington.

Eat in the food court of the popular Seattle Center Armory there, right next to the Space Needle, and you'll find three bins to fill when you're done eating: one for your trash, one for your recyclables and one for your food scraps.

A few years ago, the city banned putting food scraps in garbage, said Susan Fife-Ferris, the director of solid waste planning and program management for Seattle Public Utilities.

Table scraps and other organics like yard waste are trucked to two composting facilities, where private contractors process them into compost they sell as a soil supplement.

The city generates about 97,000 tons of organics every year, Fife-Ferris said. That's 97,000 tons of waste it doesn't have to compact and haul to Oregon for disposal in a landfill, which she said makes for substantial savings.

Why doesn't Cincinnati have a similar program for handling food scraps?

The simple answer is that there's nowhere to process them.

""If you're not willing to invest in some kind of facility, it's hard to get an organics program going,"" Fife-Ferris said.

One reason why Cincinnati doesn't have a processing facility is because of its recent history with Compost Cincy, said Kristin Weiss, executive director of Green Umbrella, a nonprofit that works to create a more sustainable region.

Environmental advocates had high hopes for Compost Cincy, a business that in August 2012 opened a commercial food waste composting facility in Winton Hills.

But within a few months of its opening, residents began complaining of odor, birds, insects and other vermin. The city of Cincinnati closed the operation in February 2014 and recently agreed on a plan for its cleanup with the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.

That costly experience convinced city officials that composting should be done indoors, preferably in an anaerobic digester that would produce both compost and natural gas. Discussions are ongoing about building such a digester, but city officials have said it's not likely the city would be an active partner in building one.

Along with the Greater Cincinnati Green Business Council, Green Umbrella is facilitating those discussions, Weiss said. There's no reason the city can't learn from its experience with Compost Cincy and have well-operating facilities, she added.

Ideally, such a facility would be located within 20 minutes of downtown to minimize the environmental impact of trucking materials long distances, she said. The problem is, given the city's experience with Compost Cincy, few residents would be willing to have one located in their backyard.

Local laws and regulations can also inhibit efforts to compost food scraps. For example, in Cincinnati there are zoning restrictions that prohibit moving food waste from one site to another for composting, said Michaela Oldfield, director of Green Umbrella's Food Policy Council.

Her group is looking at ways the city can adjust its ordinances to encourage neighbors who share community gardens to do collective composting.

Growing interest in salvaging food

Although no one wants to have a large-scale composting operation like Cincy Compost in their backyard, there seems to be a good deal of interest in backyard composting.

Every spring, the Hamilton County Recycling and Solid Waste District offers a half-dozen seminars on backyard composting that always sell out, said spokeswoman Joy Landry. The smallest venue attracts about 40 people and the largest draws 80 to 90, she said.

A free brochure on how to do backyard composting is available here.

Meanwhile, local environmentalists are looking at ways other than composting to deal with surplus food.

""Our focus is really on how we can educate people and businesses to start addressing food waste, and prevent it from happening in the first place,"" Lauren Campbell, a member of Green Umbrella's Waste Reduction Team, said.

Her team is working on a plan on how to best get that word out. One tactic is to talk with restaurateurs about how they can reuse food or send unused food to a local food bank such as FreeStore Foodbank. It accepts donations of food from canned food drives, government agencies, wholesalers, retailers and produce farmers.

Another option is the restaurant-turned-nonprofit La Soupe, which uses grocery store produce from Kroger, Jungle Jim's and local organic farms that would otherwise be tossed out to make soup for hungry people.

Last fall, the Hamilton County Solid Waste District ran a Facebook campaign to spread the word about how to make food last longer in the refrigerator, Landry said. The campaign used free ads supplied by Save the Food, a project of the Ad Council and the Natural Resources Defense Council.

At Amity Elementary School in Deer Park, a food sharing table has been set up where students can put foods they don't want for other students to eat, Landry said. Whatever's not eaten at the end of the lunch period is collected by a volunteer cafeteria worker and taken to a local food pantry.

On average, the food rescue program, which began during the 2014-15 school year, rescues 27 food items a day from the landfill. Those interested in setting up a food rescue program of their own may contact Cher Mohring, program specialist at the solid waste district, at 513-946-7737.

It's an idea that's catching on nationwide -- and that has the endorsement of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

The government mandates that children be served a certain amount of fruits and vegetables, but children don't always eat them, Oldfield said.

""If the food is unopened and properly controlled, there's no reason it should go in the garbage,"" she added.",[]

""It's something that you should be able to rely on as happening everyday at the same time when it's supposed to happen. That has not been happening in the Northland,"" Councilman Dan Fowler said.

His colleague, Councilwoman Heather Hall, came armed with a pile of papers.

""This is my stack of everybody who's complaining just recently about their trash not being picked up,"" she said.

Council members, the city manager, the solid waste department and trash contractors were all present at Tuesday's meeting.

""It's not acceptable what's occurring,"" KCMO Manager of Solid Waste Michael Shaw said.

Jim's Disposal is the subcontractor serving 55,000 homes north of the river each week. The owner told 41 Action News employee retention is partially to blame for the problems.

""It's not so much we don't have enough staff. It's the new drivers that we brought on,"" Charles Byrd explained.

He said drivers are struggling to keep up with growth in the Northland, leading to new neighborhoods and streets. As a short-term fix, Byrd is using GPS and staff to track trucks and make sure they're going to the right places.

The city's primary trash contractor, WCA, is also pitching in to fix the issue by sending four trucks up north each week. The company isn't happy about the problems.

Indianapolis is at risk of becoming the most wasteful big city in America.

It already wastes the greatest portion of its recyclable trash among any of the 20 biggest cities, and many recycle far, far more.

How bad is it? In San Francisco, the top recycling city, 80 percent of the trash is reused. In Seattle, almost all residents participate in the program, reusing nearly 60 percent of the waste. The national average is 35 percent.

And in Indianapolis? Only 7 percent is recycled.

IndyStar gathered and analyzed recycling rates — the percentage of waste that is kept from the landfill or incinerator — for the 50 most populous cities in the country. Urban areas from New York City to Houston, Portland to Milwaukee and Phoenix to Columbus typically recycle as much as 20 or 30 percent of their waste, and some much more.

Indy — the nation's 14th largest city — is the biggest municipality without a curbside recycling program serving every household. And only two of the top 50 cities — Detroit and New Orleans — recycle slightly less than Indianapolis.

Unlike Indianapolis, however, those cities are notorious for their financial struggles. In Indianapolis, the situation has been a matter of policy.

Instead of creating an incentive to recycle, the city's trash hauler charges residents for the privilege. And lurking behind that decision is politicians' reluctance to pay for a robust system, and their long commitment to burning a huge portion of the city's trash that could be recycled.

“Absolutely, Indianapolis is behind,” said Ron Gonen, co-founder and CEO of the Closed Loop Fund, a national organization that funds efforts to build and expand recycling infrastructure. “If I was an Indy resident, I would be scratching my head and asking the city: 'What are we missing in Indy? Why aren’t we able to take advantage of this?'”

And, in fact, many are.

Newcomers are often caught off guard. David Johnson moved here nearly two years ago from Seattle, where recycling is a way of life — if not a “hobby,” as he describes it. He was disappointed to find out recycling was ""like a foreign language"" in Indianapolis.

“It implies the city is not vibrant, behind the times, and not a leader in conservation or clean environment efforts,” Johnson said.

Longtime residents also say they want universal recycling. City officials say they receive weekly phone calls and emails from people asking about recycling. Responding to a 2016 survey by the city's Office of Sustainability, 91 percent of residents asked agreed that recycling is important.

Recycling is no longer considered an amenity for the best cities, said Allyson Mitchell, executive director of the Indiana Recycling Coalition. It’s an expectation. Any city without it is at a disadvantage when trying to attract progressive companies.

Mayor Joe Hogsett’s administration has now promised to expand the program.

""We have an unsustainable model for trash disposal that is the legacy system that has grown up over time,"" Indianapolis Deputy Mayor Jeff Bennett said. ""The future of solid waste has to change, so we are looking at how do you include universal curbside recycling in that future.""

But, for decades, mayor after mayor in Indianapolis — Republican and Democrat — has made similar promises that went nowhere. Residents and advocates wonder if this time will be different.

“It’s a sad, sad story in Indianapolis,” Mitchell said. “It’s a saga.”

Penalized for recycling

The city’s recycling problems date back to decisions made more than 40 years ago, when a country enormously dependent on fossil fuels was hit by rising oil prices and diminishing landfill space.

As early as 1975, city officials created a task force to find ways to reduce the amount of trash going into landfills because the city was ""running out of options,"" according to Dave Arland, who was press secretary to former Mayor William Hudnut. By 1981, they landed on the idea of building an incinerator to create energy, a path they would doggedly stick to over the next 38 years.

What was then Ogden Martin Systems came to town in 1985 and struck up a deal with the city to build and operate an incinerator. The city issued $109 million in bonds to finance the project, which Ogden was on the hook to pay — so the city needed Ogden to succeed. In 1988 the incinerator on Harding Street on the southwest side burned its first load of trash.

It was billed as a form of recycling. And indeed it put trash to use. The city bought steam energy produced by the incinerator to heat and cool its downtown buildings.

Strictly speaking, however, it was not a recycling program. The plastics, paper, aluminum and other materials heaped into the incinerator were reused only once. A curbside recycling program not only reduces the need for landfill space, but also reuses the materials again and again.

What’s more, an incinerator is not as clean. Five months after its launch, the incinerator violated its air quality permit for the first time. And it has done so repeatedly: In its first few years of operating, the incinerator exceeded its pollution limits as many as six to 10 times a month. The facility violated its permit as recently as 2018 when equipment malfunctions caused it to spew too much carbon monoxide into the air.

Even when it operates within federal limits, the incinerator produces more greenhouse gases than recycling does. And the ash and other detritus the incinerator generates are still sent to the landfill.

Many cities were already abandoning their incinerator plans or closing their facilities by the mid-1990s. Instead, cities from coast-to-coast and throughout Indiana were launching curbside recycling.

Indianapolis officials, however, showed only a faint interest in joining what was swiftly becoming standard operating procedure. Officials at the New Jersey-based company now called Covanta insisted that the incinerator did not create a disincentive for curbside recycling — a position they maintain today.

“In the vast majority of the communities where we operate, curbside has been very successful,” company spokesman James Regan told IndyStar. “We have always been supportive of increasing recycling in the city … and we remain supportive.” Arland agreed, and emphasized that incineration and recycling are not mutually exclusive.

But, in practice, the contract with Covanta created hurdles.

As part of the contract, Indianapolis received a break on the steam energy costs based on how much trash it sent to the incinerator — if it sent less, it paid more for energy.

The incinerator had such a hunger for fuel that the city passed an ordinance that forbade trash haulers operating in the city from disposing of their refuse anywhere else because the facility ""needed a guaranteed method of revenue,"" Arland told IndyStar. Such ordinances were later struck down as unconstitutional for discriminating against interstate and international trade.

Still, it made clear how adamant the city was about burning as much trash as possible.

Another contract clause also encouraged incineration. It required the city to deliver more than 300,000 tons of waste per year to the incinerator, or pay a penalty.

Again and again, the wisdom of that penalty was debated as mayor after mayor promised to expand recycling. Yet the penalty created by Mayor William Hudnut was sustained through the administrations of Steve Goldsmith, Bart Peterson and Greg Ballard.

“It is inexplicable to me that over the course of many administrations that the contract was renewed again and again, and someone didn’t say we need to take this out of there,” said state Rep. Carey Hamilton, who now represents Marion County but previously led the Indiana Recycling Coalition.

The penalty survived until Hogsett removed it early in his term.

“Without a doubt that was a deterrent because it was a disincentive to try to capture the most,” Mitchell said. “But now we can institute recycling without fear of penalty.”

Lack of political will

In the early 1990s Indiana's legislature adopted sweeping changes to how solid waste is managed, creating an explosion of recycling programs — everywhere but in Marion County.

The law created county solid waste management districts to serve as dedicated, independent experts to develop recycling programs and set the rates necessary to run them. But it exempted Marion County, largely because of Covanta’s incinerator.

Observers say those districts effectively removed the politics from recycling decisions — and more than 100 cities and towns across the state pursued recycling. Indiana’s recycling rate rose to 17 percent, even without a comprehensive program in the state’s largest city.

But in Marion County, politicians still held the reins. And they were loath to raise money to pay for recycling. Arland said it feels good to say the city has universal recycling, but it comes with a price tag.

""It requires political will to make it happen and a City-County Council willing to put its neck on the line if taxes needed to go up to support it,"" he said. ""That may have changed now, but at the end of the day it just was not possible in the late '70s and early '80s.""

In fact, the taboo on raising rates was so strong city politicians not only failed to launch a viable recycling program, they also declined to raise the solid waste fee for more than 30 years.

Today's solid waste fee does not even cover the true cost of trash disposal. To cover the shortfall — a number that continues to grow — the city has been drawing down a fund that is expected to be depleted in a few years. When that happens, rates will need to rise or the city will need to rob funds used for other city services.

“It was a very unpopular thing as mayor to increase rates,” Mitchell said. “Recycling inherently became political, and the problem just continued to compound over the years.”

Even as far back as 1991, for example, Goldsmith stumped on increasing recycling options. In the end, however, he proved reluctant to invest in a program that a local trash hauler at the time said the city considered a “necessary nuisance.”

Still, Goldsmith takes credit for creating the city's curbside leaf collection program and for conducting studies that looked at increasing curbside pick-up. In a statement to the Star, the former mayor said his administration did not want to add charges to make recycling mandatory. Peterson did not respond to requests for comment.

Not everyone thought of it that way, however. Residents increasingly asked for a program. And at least one Indianapolis glass recycling company said it teetered on the edge of closure. Strategic Materials blamed the city for the company's inability to operate at full capacity. Company officials said they would not have located here if the city had no intention of establishing a comprehensive program.

“I thought the city would implement curbside (recycling) countywide; everybody led me to believe that,” Ed McMahon told the Indianapolis Star in an April 1996 article. He was the vice president for the northern region of Strategic Materials, which still operates — below capacity — in the city.

“I would think sooner or later they’ll have to recycle,” McMahon said more than 20 years ago, “the rest of the world is.”

Employing their ""necessary nuisance"" philosophy, city officials did reluctantly back into a subscription recycling program. Many cities that embraced recycling achieved recycling rates of 40 percent or more by charging residents more to throw away trash, less to recycle. But Indianapolis did the opposite: residents have to pay as much as $99 a year for the privilege of recycling.

And the results, critics say, were predictable. Only 10 percent of residents have opted into the program. The city acknowledges both its participation and recycling rates are low, Bennett said, ""even among participants in a voluntary program.""

Ballard tried, but flopped

As advances in oil and gas drilling, wind and solar power, and electric vehicles caught on — revolutionizing America’s energy mix and making it an exporter of fossil fuels — Indianapolis stuck with its 1970s Energy Crisis-era waste management strategy.

The incinerator contract was up for renewal in 2008, yet the city didn't recognize a need for change, and stayed its course.

By 2014, a group funded by companies including Procter & Gamble, PepsiCo and Coca-Cola sent a letter to the city offering interest-free financing “to support the deployment of a curbside recycling program.” Other cities had received between $3 million and $7 million.

The Closed Loop Fund, as the industry group is called, had its eyes trained on Indianapolis, which is surrounded by the companies' plants and facilities across the state and region.

The city, however, left that offer on the table.

“The city was offered significant resources to get a program started, and they declined that opportunity,” Hamilton said. “It was incredibly frustrating to me as a leader trying to bring curbside to all.""

Instead, then-Mayor Ballard, who was widely seen as a champion of green causes, signed a $112 million deal with Covanta to combine its waste incinerator operations with a recycling program, a move whose shortcomings were later revealed on an international stage.

Under that set-up, all waste — including trash and recyclables — would still be tossed together in one bin at the end of Indianapolis driveways. Then, machines at Covanta’s facility would pluck the recyclable goods out from all that garbage. Those materials would go on to a recycling facility, while the trash would make its way to the incinerator.

Ballard, who declined requests for comment for this story, said at the time that the deal would finally bring recycling to the city.

“The mayor and city were looking for a one-stop-shop solution by keeping it all under Covanta,” said John Barth, a former Democratic city-county councilman during Ballard’s time in office. “But that was more a good sell than good recycling.”

Critics likened Covanta's proposed process to “dirty recycling.” They argued the recyclable materials would be contaminated by garbage and rendered unusable — that was the case when recyclers rejected materials from a similar plant in Alabama. It also would have left other recyclables, such as glass and some plastics, destined for the inferno.

A lawsuit challenged the contract, saying it was forged behind closed doors without public input or a competitive bidding process. After a prolonged battle, the Indiana Court of Appeals ultimately nixed the deal in 2016.

“If that deal had gone through,” Mitchell said, “it would have literally killed the ability to do a world class recycling program in this city.”

The impracticality of Ballard’s plan was revealed in 2017 when China announced it was tired of sorting through America’s trash.

For years, China had accepted as much as half of the world's trash. But then it said the recyclables the U.S. and other countries were sending over were too contaminated — either with the wrong items, such as garden hoses, or the right items in the wrong way, such as dirty containers.

Had Ballard's deal gone through, Indianapolis would have committed to a $112 million combined trash and recycling program just as other cities were scrambling to keep garbage and recyclables separate.

It was well-intentioned, Mitchell and Barth acknowledge, but misguided. Not taking into account the recycling industry’s needs, Indianapolis’ one attempt failed.

The defeat of Ballard's decision, however, cleared the way for a new program.

“The city emerged from what many saw as an impending disaster to one with tremendous potential,” said Scott Mouw, the senior director for strategy and research at The Recycling Partnership.

Opportunity for the future

Some wonder if Indianapolis will repeat some of its old mistakes.

Many major cities have set their sights on growing the amount they recycle by 2020 and to reaching zero waste by 2030 or 2035.

Indianapolis has promised to create a universal curbside recycling program, but its launch won't be complete until 2025, although some preliminary work to deploy the blue recycling carts may begin before then.

City officials say the 2025 target is necessary to ensure residents are educated and ready to recycle. Recycling advocates are not convinced.

That target date coincides with the expiration of the city’s contract with its trash hauler, Republic Services. Like the Covanta contract, the Republic contract has been continually renewed, most recently in 2015.

Mitchell said she thinks the program could and would be in place sooner if not for the contract. And Johnson said residents shouldn’t have to wait six more years.

Cost also remains a question. Some cities charge more than Indianapolis to provide their recycling and waste disposal services, Bennett said. And Indianapolis officials — anticipating the day the city's waste disposal fund runs dry — are closely examining fees.

""Our focus is really on the future of solid waste as a whole, knowing that the funding model we now have doesn’t work this way forever,"" Bennett said.

It is unclear if the city will have to raise the solid waste fee to expand recycling, said Katie Robinson, director of the Indianapolis Office of Sustainability. The city will explore creating a solid waste management district, she added, and look to partner with the Closed Loop Fund and Recycling Partnership to offset costs.

Still, Mouw, Mitchell and others are hopeful it will be different this time.

Recycling advocates say it's hard to overstate the impact — or the opportunity — the China announcement represents.

It sent shock waves through the industry. U.S. programs are now wondering how they can produce cleaner recyclables and where they will send them.

The Recycling Partnership, Closed Loop and others say the absence of a comprehensive recycling program gives Indianapolis a unique opportunity to build a new system set up to succeed.

""Given everything that's been going on internationally,"" Robinson said, ""I actually think Indianapolis is best positioned to develop a pretty extraordinary program and develop it correctly.""

The city can educate residents on how to use it. It can enhance facilities with technology to better sort the materials. It can learn from other cities. And it can work with manufacturers around the state to put the recyclables to use.

""The more close-to-home we can keep the materials ... the more we can generate the jobs, economic benefits and environmental benefits,"" Bennett said. ""And that’s how the future is different from the past this time.""

Mitchell and others feel hopeful. She said a universal recycling program is a prerequisite before Indianapolis can consider itself a world class city — and it has a lot of work to get there.

“We are a unique situation because it is so broken here that it means we get to start from scratch,” she said. “But my biggest fear in this whole situation, with the China ban and starting our own program, is that the state and Indianapolis don’t squeeze every last drop out of this opportunity.”

According to The Columbus Dispatch, materials recycled in Columbus travel only about 250 miles to various sites, while some items don’t leave the state. The Dispatch spoke with Steve Sargent, director of Cincinnati-headquartered Rumpke Recycling, who said Rumpke is not really dependent on foreign markets.

“Only 2 percent of the materials Rumpke recycles is exported,” Sargent told The Dispatch. “That only applies to baled cardboard, which is shipped to Taiwan and South America.”

The Columbus Dispatch has more information:

For years, cities across the country have indoctrinated residents to rinse, sort and recycle glass and plastic containers. Unsoiled cardboard boxes are to be broken down for pickup.

But now many cities can’t afford to keep up their recycling programs since China’s national policy put a stop to importing plastic and paper products from the West.

MOMOS/WIKIMEDIA

New York City spends more on arts and culture than any other city in the United States—and more than any single state. The budget of the city’s Department of Cultural Affairs exceeds that of the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. The city has been funding the arts since the 19th century, but until now City Hall has never embarked on a comprehensive review of where all that money goes and what it does.

The result of that effort is a 180-page report released today called “CREATENYC: A Cultural Plan for All New Yorkers,” which aims to reorient the city’s cultural life toward neglected corners of the five boroughs by bringing the arts to previously ignored neighborhoods and pushing some of the jewels in the city’s cultural crown to make a greater effort towards getting residents of those neighborhoods through their doors.

“We are clear: there are no cultural deserts in New York City,” Tom Finkelpearl, the commissioner of the city’s Department of Cultural Affairs, said in an interview. “There are arts organizations and artists in every part of the city, but there are not necessarily well-resourced artists and arts organizations in every part of the city. There are parts of the city and communities that remain underserved.”

The plan calls for the agency to begin immediately increasing its support for arts organizations in those neighborhoods, including those on city-owned property, which already receive significant funding from the city in exchange for having a free or reduced-cost admissions policy. Known as the Cultural Institutions Group (CIG), these city-affiliated museums include the Met and the Museum of Natural History, but also Wave Hill in the Bronx, the Jamaica Center for Arts and Learning, El Museo del Barrio, and other institutions farther from the city’s core.

The new plan advocates for translations services for arts organizations, new funding to support cultural workers with disabilities, and a professional development program aiming to help people of color ascend the ranks of leadership at the city’s museums and art spaces. Under the plan, the city would also help arts organizations lower their carbon footprint and increase direct support to artists, particularly those working with and in historically disenfranchised communities. In addition, at a press conference today unveiling the plan, officials said that they would continue to survey organizations on the diversity of their boards and staffs, with results potentially influencing funding decisions.

“We need to look at culture in terms of all the benefits that New Yorkers receive from being residents of this really great city,” said Arnold Lehman, a former head of the Brooklyn Museum and a member of the advisory committee that authored the report. “The challenge is that not everyone shares equally in it, in part because some people are not interested, but mostly because over many, many decades a kind of elitism has come to be associated with culture and it hasn’t had an all-city approach.”

City officials embarked on a massive outreach effort to put the cultural plan together, meeting by their own account with almost 200,000 New Yorkers in workshops across the five boroughs over the course of the past year. But they did so only at the prodding of the City Council, which passed a bill two years ago mandating that New York follow cities like Chicago, Denver, and Houston in systematically plotting its cultural strategy.

City Hall initially resisted the effort.

“Some folks would argue that in a city as rich as ours is in cultural attractions, and so full of artists, why do you need to do a cultural plan?” said Councilman Jimmy Van Bramer, who sponsored the legislation. “And if we have a plan, then we have to follow through on that plan and actually do stuff, and some folks don’t want to be tied down to such a firm commitment.”

But, Van Bramer added, “there are many people in the city of New York who for whatever reason felt that all of those attractions and all of those institutions weren’t for them, or they have a hesitation about accessing them, or inability to go to them. We have an obligation to tear down those barriers and find out where the gaps and inequities were. We are doing a lot. We are the cultural capital of the world. It’s about being self-reflective and acknowledging that we are doing it as well as we want to.”

Officials were unwilling to put a price tag on how much all of these initiatives will cost. The city already spends half a billion dollars a year on culture when the DCA’s budget ($188.1 million for fiscal year 2018), capital costs, and education programs are counted, according to Van Bramer. Finkelpearl said that the initiative to green the city’s arts institutions would cost $25 million, and that the effort to increase access for the disabled would cost around $10 million, with an additional $1 million being sent to CIG institutions that increase access for disenfranchised communities. Mayor Bill de Blasio and the City Council have also been upping their funding for the DCA in recent years.

“We allocated significant funding already, but clearly the report is challenging us to do even more, and I anticipate and welcome that,” Van Bramer said.

A sample IDNYC card. COURTESY CITY OF NEW YORK

Despite those funding increases, many in the art world do not see New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio as a champion of the arts in the way that his predecessor, Mike Bloomberg, was. Bloomberg is a collector of Old Masters, and helped bring to the city major public projects like Olafur Eliasson’s The New York City Waterfalls (2008), Paul Ramirez Jonas’s Key to the City (2010), and most famously, The Gates (1979–2005) of Christo and Jeanne-Claude. Asked what would be the paradigmatic de Blasio cultural initiative on that scale, Finkelpearl said the IDNYC program, which created a municipal identification card for all city residents who wanted one, regardless of citizenship status, and permitted holders free membership at several city arts institutions.

There had been concern among officials affiliated with some of the city’s major institutions that the cultural plan would mean less funding for them. The Met, for instance, is already dealing with a budget shortfall and earlier this year drafted a plan to institute a mandatory admission fee for visitors from outside New York State, a proposal that the city is currently considering. But funding for such institutions will hold steady for now, according to the plan released today.

As the city embarked on its effort to put the plan together, it also faced criticism from some who feared that it would not do enough to address the affordability crisis that artists face in a city of rising rents and disappearing studio, rehearsal, and performance spaces. “The People’s Cultural Plan,” an alternative put forward by a trio of artists earlier this summer, pointed out that real-estate companies with ties to the de Blasio administration were contracted to work on blueprint. The PCP, as it is known, calls for fair wages for artists, commercial rent control, and community land trusts for artist housing.

Artists, said Jenny Dubnau, who is one of the authors of the alternative plan, need to reckon with how they are often used by real-estate interests to increase gentrification, as well as the overall expense of working in the city.

“Our biggest issue is with what the plan doesn’t do,” said Dubnau, “It doesn’t make recommendations to address gentrification and displacement, which is affecting poor communities and communities of color and harshly affecting artists and art organization. We need to speak out against the ways that the branding of the arts is being used to raise property values in poor neighborhoods.”

The Center for an Urban Future, a think tank, has issued two reports in the past decade detailing the difficulties New York has in providing a welcoming home for artists and arts organizations. However, a recent CUF study noted that there are more artists in New York than there were a decade ago, proof that the long-rumored exodus of city artists to midsize cities eager to poach them has not actually occurred. At least not yet.

“We believe there are cracks,” Finkelpearl said. “And if enough people are talking about how the city is too expensive to be an artist in, then there will be a breaking point.”

“But it is not happening,” he added. “Artists are still moving here.”",[]

According to the “landmark” agreement, the city will pay what will eventually amount to hundreds of millions of dollars to enhance handicap accessibility for residents living in its low-income housing.

The exact sum will depend on how long it takes the city to complete the requirements spelled out in the agreement, which states that the value will average a minimum of $20 million per year.

The work includes the development of 10,000 units of new affordable housing over the next 10 years, including 1,500 accessible units for the disabilities – a number that exceeds current state and federal requirements.

The city will also retrofit existing housing developments that do not meet accessibility standards to create an additional 3,100 housing units for individuals with disabilities. And, it will participate in program with HUD that will explore innovative ways to enhance accessibility in affordable housing developments.

“As a result of this settlement, thousands of individuals with disabilities, including those experiencing homelessness in the City of Los Angeles, will have equal access to affordable housing and access to cutting-edge features that will enable them to live independently,” said HUD Secretary Ben Carson. “I’m pleased we can now turn a page and begin the real work of providing affordable housing to the people who need it most and have gone without it for too long.”

Importantly, the terms of the settlement note that the City of Los Angeles is not admitting any wrongdoing or violation of federal law.

This will officially close the civil rights investigation against the city brought by the Department of Justice in 2017, which alleged that it misappropriated hundreds of millions of dollars from HUD that were earmarked for the express purpose of creating accessible housing.

HUD said the DOJ filed the suit after the department was unable to achieve a successful resolution with the city, but that all changed once the authorities got involved, with the city expressing “renewed interest in achieving resolution of this matter through a voluntary compliance agreement with HUD.”

The DOJ then kicked the case back to HUD in the hopes that a resolution be reached outside of the courtroom. Friday’s announcement brings the matter to an end.

HUD’s General Counsel Paul Compton Jr. warned HUD grantees to pay attention to this agreement.

“HUD expects its grantees to comply with the requirements of fair housing and civil rights laws,” Compton said in a release. “We will use the legal tools at our disposal to protect the rights of individuals with disabilities to live in affordable, accessible housing.”

This is not the first time the City of Los Angeles has been forced to cough up cash for its failure to comply with HUD’s accessibility guidelines.

In 2016, the city agreed to pay more than $200 million over the course of a decade to settle a 2012 lawsuit brought by three fair housing groups. The terms of the agreement required the city to ensure that 4,000 units will be built or retrofitted to accommodate disabled residents living in low-income housing.

And now, the settlement announced Friday will bring even more accessible housing to the city.

Anna Maria Farias, HUD’s assistant secretary for Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity, said the department is pleased with the substantial commitment to accessible housing laid out in the agreement.

“The scope and scale of this agreement is unprecedented, and we are unaware of an accessibility commitment of this magnitude,” Farias said. “I’m happy that the city will finally deliver accessible housing to Angelinos with disabilities and will be working with HUD to fulfill the promises of this in the years to come.”",[]
https://www.chicagobusiness.com/lightfoot-100/can-transportation-equity-happen-chicago,['Chicago'],Can transportation equity happen in Chicago?,"Chicago has the second-largest transit network among U.S. cities, but depending on where you live, it can feel like a transit desert.

Consistent with the Metropolitan Planning Council’s ""Cost of Segregation"" findings, further analysis found Chicago’s black and brown communities are disproportionately affected by longer commute times. A resident of Chicago’s South Shore neighborhood who looks forward to benefiting from the jobs juggernaut of the O’Hare terminal modernization would have to stomach a 90-minute transit commute each way.

At the same time, gridlock in the Loop is getting worse. While ride-share companies like Uber and Lyft generated about 2 million trips locally each month back in 2015, that number grew to 9 million trips each month in 2018. And almost half of those solo riders are taking short trips between the Loop and North Side where transit is often plentiful, adding to hassles and delays for walkers, bikers and drivers.

There are no easy fixes to increasing transportation mobility, accessibility and equity. But there are promising steps Mayor Lightfoot can take, even in her first 100 days. Many are detailed in three bold transportation blueprints, including one issued just this March. Two ideas that can be championed immediately by the Lightfoot administration: rewarding businesses that encourage transit use and helping transit commuters who need it most.

First up, fairer fares. CTA offers discounted rides for children, students, the elderly and people with disabilities. There are no price breaks for low-income individuals. Last year, MPC released ""Our Equitable Future,"" a policy road map to increase equity and inclusion.

One recommendation, a 50 percent transit fare subsidy for adults living below the federal poverty line (10 to 15 percent of transit riders), would cost $25 million to $50 million annually, but the return on investment to our regional economy could be even bigger. By lowering the financial burden of transportation, residents will have easier access to employment, education, health care, and more, leading to more stable families and neighborhoods.",[]
https://www.stripes.com/news/advocates-virginia-beach-failing-military-families-with-special-needs-children-1.463366,['Virginia Beach'],Advocates: Virginia Beach failing military families with special-needs children,"Marisa Norman, center, a special education student who lives in Virginia Beach, Va., cheers with her hand up just ahead of a regional cheerleading competition on Feb. 26 in Norfolk. Marisa's parents fought the school district to place her in a private school where they say she is flourishing.

VIRGINIA BEACH, Va. — With more than a quarter of its 67,214 students coming from military families, the school district in Virginia Beach is one of the most military-connected divisions in the country.

The region is home to six aircraft carriers, dozens of ships and hundreds of aircraft. It hosts the largest U.S. naval base in the world, half the Navy SEAL population, a nuclear shipyard, and thousands of military families and defense contractors who anchor the economy.

The Virginia Beach City Public School district has many programs supporting military families that are often recognized for excellence.

But when it comes to special education, some military families say Virginia Beach is failing their children. Half a dozen military families who spoke with Stars and Stripes said their special-needs children fell through the cracks, and experts working with them said the children were denied services they need to learn.

“I felt like we were a burden, like we were expendable,” said Christine Kemper, wife of a retired Navy SEAL. Kemper said her older children breezed through the school district. But when their youngest started having trouble, school officials denied that he needed help and asked her if she was sure she wanted to “label” her child. After battling the district for months — with the help of the charity SEALkids, Inc. and an advocate that the nonprofit provided — the couple put their child in an expensive private school, where the only accommodation he needed was to sit in the front of the class.

“He went from failing reading to being an accelerated reader,” she said.

Jan Price said she and her husband, a retired admiral, fought the school district to have their daughter’s learning disability acknowledged. The Prices got their daughter tested privately and said that only then did she get the accommodation she needed to go from failing math to getting an A in calculus.

“The system doesn’t work for them,” Price said. “It makes them feel broken.”

Their advocate, Amy Courtney, said she has seen dozens of similar cases in the district. She worked for 15 years as a school child psychologist and behavior specialist in the nearby Chesapeake School District. After retiring in 1995, she has worked as a paid advocate for parents of special-needs children — working privately and for SEALkids.

“If I am needed on behalf of an admiral, what does that tell you about other families?” she said.

The school district disputes the characterization by these families. Deputy City Attorney for Public Education Kamala Lannetti said Virginia Beach receives a disproportionate number of military children with special needs and is “generally considered a division of choice.” Because of the large concentration of military families and medical services, Virginia Beach is one of just five locations where the Navy assigns severe special-needs families.

She said special education is complex and often fraught with different interpretations of the law, which provides for every student to receive a “free and appropriate public education.” She noted that out of the district’s 10,000 kids with disabilities, there are “a handful” who claimed they have had issues.

Lannetti stressed the school district’s dedication to all military families: “We have probably the best transition program for (military) children in the country.”

Division spokeswoman Heather Allen, addressing concerns of the special-needs parents, highlighted the district’s record of serving all military families: from successful counselors on staff and peer support programs aimed at increasing military awareness to awards for excellence.

The Navy said its school liaison officers work closely with the school district and will reach out when there are issues. Charles Clymer, the Navy’s program manager for child and youth education services, acknowledges that while the liaison officers can exert what he called “a quiet influence,” that’s as far as they will go.

“If a parent wants us to try to strong-arm, we’d be hard-pressed.”

There are 7,926 special needs students in the Virginia Beach school district and 2,300 more who require accommodation but not an Individualized Education Program. At the last official count in 2015, the district said there were 1,546 military-connected students requiring an IEP, with an unspecified number requiring some accommodation.

The district receives federal aid to offset the loss of property taxes from exempt military families. It also receives educational grants from the Department of Defense Educational Activities agency. In 2014, Virginia Beach was a recipient of a multi-year, $1 million DoDEA grant for special education that went to seven schools to provide extra resources for military connected students.

The grant also paid for an instructional specialist who works in collaboration with the district’s parents, and a support liaison for military special-education families. Those two officials have been asked to make a presentation about their success at a state education conference later this month, Allen said.

Courtney says those successes don’t negate failures she has seen for military families. An example: when school officials set the bar so low for special-needs students that failing is acceptable.

She cited one IEP in which the goals for the child were to get “at least 50 percent accuracy on 2 of 3 quizzes” involving math equations; solve three out of five real world multistep word problems; and complete 60 percent of her assignments in a nine-week period.

“How will completing 60 percent of general assignments contribute to this student’s successful completion of ninth grade?” Courtney asked.

What vision does the Virginia Beach City Public School district hold for this student’s future “when seemingly content to continue to offer IEPs like this to parents?” she said. “How much assistance should parents require in relation to attempts to address IEP proposals that are educationally indefensible?”

Lannetti said the district follows the rules of special education, trying to keep special-needs children in regular classes as much as possible. But Courtney disagrees. She — and her clients — say the district overall is not a good fit for their children.

“It’s kind of a school-by-school basis,” Courtney said of judging the Virginia Beach district. “But it is a problematic area. In my opinion, military families with special needs shouldn’t be assigned here.”

The plaintiffs, a group of disability organizations and disabled residents who brought the lawsuits as a class action in state and federal court, say that the city’s subway system is one of the least accessible public transportation systems in the United States, with the lowest accessibility rate — 24 percent — among the country’s 10 largest transit systems.

More than 75 percent of the city’s 472 subway stations do not have elevators, lifts or other methods that make them accessible for people who use wheelchairs, mobility devices or are otherwise unable to use stairs. Of the approximately 112 stations that are designated as wheelchair-accessible, only 100 currently offer working elevator service for passengers traveling in different directions, the lawsuits charge. (The MTA said that 117 of its stations are accessible to people with disabilities.)

The lack of elevator service in the city’s subway system has been a longstanding problem. Michelle A. Caiola, the litigation director for Disability Rights Advocates, which is representing the plaintiffs, said the legal challenge comes after many futile attempts to achieve a resolution with the transit agency.",[]
https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/houston-texas/houston/article/Houston-hosts-11th-Disability-Unity-and-Pride-14476053.php,['Houston'],"Houston celebrates disabilities, diversity in 11th annual event","Ricky Harris took to the stage at Metropolitan Multi-Services Center in Houston Saturday afternoon and delivered a poem with his hands.

As his fingers fluttered and cut through the air to form signs, the room was quiet.

“In a deaf world, hands give us freedom. In a deaf world, silence is always gold,” he signed while a person translated his words on a microphone. “Deafness is celebrated instead of mourned. Deaf is beautiful. In a deaf world, silence is normal.”

Harris’ performance was just one of many at the 11th annual Disability Unity and Pride Celebration, an event that brought together more than 100 people and advocates in the spirit of empowerment, solidarity and fellowship.

Formerly known as the Disability Awareness Month Kick Off — the awareness month is hosted every October — the event was hosted by the Mayor’s Office for People with Disabilities and featured a variety of performances, exhibitors and vendors, and complimentary lunch served by The H.E.A.R.T. program, which offers housing, entrepreneurship and readiness training for adults with disabilities.

“Unity and pride are the big words today,” said Mayor Sylvester Turner during his welcome address.

“All of us here have much to be proud of together for the unified work we’ve done to ensure the full inclusion of Houstonians with disabilities,” Turner said. “We talk about diversity, but I truly want it to be diverse in every way, and that includes the disability community, because that’s when the city is reflective of everyone.”

The event’s theme, “People Like Us: An Artistic Manifestation of Our Humanity as Disabled People,” was an opportunity to celebrate the humanity of people with disabilities and allow them to connect with the audience by telling their truths in artistic ways, said Maria Palacios, the committee chair for the event and a commissioner for Houston Commission on Disabilities.

The committee had been preparing for the event and the scripted show of performances for 10 months, insuring that it was led by people with disabilities, said Palacios, who is known in the community as the “Goddess on Wheels.” (Her wheelchair sported a purple license plate with the word “goddess” sprawled on the back as evidence.)

It’s a chance for the community to “demonstrate just how tremendously valuable our disabled lives are” and not through a lens of ableism or pity, said Palacios.

“We want to rise above that, and we want to make sure that we bring the proper representation and show that disability is natural, disability is strong, that we are people in the community who are movers and shakers and we’re out there doing our thing, not despite of, but because of our disabilities,” she said. “We are poets and writers and singers and dancers and lawyers and doctors and mothers and everything else that the non-disabled world thinks we can’t be.”

Aside from the various performers, more than a dozen exhibitors and vendors offered services and education, including University of Houston’s College of Pharmacy, which did blood glucose and blood pressure checks and educated attendees on naloxone, the drug used in the case of a narcotic overdose.

Mandy Ordonez who lives in southeast Houston attended the event for her third time and took a special interest in a booth that offered special goggles to assist her low vision, offering special effects like face recognition and the ability to zoom in and out.

“I always say we’re stronger in numbers, and I feel like we all want our independence, and this (event) gives us a way to be able to know that there’s agencies out there that can help us do that, to live independently .. and to help each other along the way,” Ordonez said.

Mikey Fields, also from southeast Houston, came to the event for the first time with his two sons. He said the event was informative and empowering, providing a great example of the many different types of people, disabilities and resources available.

“There’s so much information. There’s no excuse or reason you shouldn’t go away with what you need. Each table and every individual has knowledge of something that can help a person with a disability live the best life that they can,” he said.

As for the performances, Fields said they offered encouragement for people within the community to do their best.

“You might not be able to do the things that able-bodied people can do, but as long as you can do, you can make an impact in your community,” he said.

Turner said he was also inspired by the event.

“When I looked out at the community, I saw a lot of diversity within the disabled community,” he said. “It’s about pulling everyone together.”

Turner also recognized major contributions and volunteer efforts of advocates within the disability community with an award ceremony. The mayor awarded philanthropist Gary Lynn as advocate of the year; Rafferty Laredo, the president and CEO of the United Spinal Association of Houston with the ally award; Kirsten Passmore, a Lone Star College student and founder of cosplay store for disabled CosAbility, with the youth advocate award; and Hilda Montemayor, the posthumous advocate award for her work within Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County for disabled riders.

Turner also recognized Gabriel “Gabe” M. Cazares, the new director of the Mayor’s Office For People With Disabilities.

But there’s a lot more to be done in a city that touts diversity, Turner added.

“Diversity doesn’t mean anything if people can’t avail themselves of all the good things that exist in the city, being able to get to point A to point B safely in our city, taking advantage of the job opportunities, and our beautiful parks,” he said, so it’s important to ensure that the city not just diverse, but inclusive and accessible to everyone.

Fire destroyed a Phoenix playground on Monday that had been adapted for individuals with developmental or physical disabilities.

No one was injured, and investigators are trying to determine what caused the blaze at the Arizona Recreation Center for the Handicapped near 15th Street and Missouri Avenue.

Investigations are ongoing, but, there may be reason to believe the fire was set intentionally, ARCH officials said in a statement.

“The kids are confused on why this is happening. They’re confused on why they can’t just go out and play,"" said Stephanie Cisneros, a spokeswoman for the non-profit organization.

She called the playground's destruction “heartbreaking,” adding that the play space had been used and loved by so many people.

“This playground is such a large attraction for families and children,” she said. “Families walk in and see it and know that this facility cares about their children. To have it taken away is disheartening.”

A GoFundMe page was created Wednesday and has raised more than $2,000 in one day. Officials are hoping to reopen a new playground as soon as possible — a $200,000 feat.

History

ARCH started in 1975 with the goal of providing therapeutic recreation services, education and wellness programs, and social opportunities for individuals with special needs.

The five-acre recreation center houses participants from neighborhoods, partner programs and schools from all over the Valley.

This isn't the first time the organization has dealt with a fire.

In 1984, the group's former facility at the Alhambra Elementary School was burned down by arsonists, according to a statement from Kip Murray, the executive director.

Group offers variety of programs

In 2015, the program opened a new facility, and two years later added an adaptive playground.

In addition to the playground, the ARCHKids summer camp provides an opportunity for children to participate in recreation and enrichment activities for a 10-week period.

ARCHKids also has an after-school program.

Cisneros said ARCHKids has about 35 participants in its summer program this year. During the school year, more than 100 children participate in the ARCHKids’ program.

Many participants are from low-income families who have with few childcare options.

What does 'adaptive playground' mean?

Both the facility and playground were designed for children with a developmental or physical disability.

Adaptive playgrounds, sometimes called inclusive or accessible playgrounds, are created so children of all abilities can have a pleasurable play experience in the same space.

These types of playgrounds have benefits for all individuals as they can promote the learning of an array of motor, cognitive and sensory skills, according to Little Tikes Commercial, a playground developer. Features often include wheelchair-accessible play space and wide paths so that children can walk or roll easily between playground equipment. Surfaces are also designed to be easy to use with wheelchairs and other mobility devices.

Cisneros said adaptive play spaces and facilities are needed in every community, especially for children with developmental or physical disabilities.

“It’s not very easy for them to just go to any playground,"" she said. At an adaptable playground, ""they can just have fun, be comfortable and be themselves.”

Michael Kowalczyk/Getty Images

Sixteen percent of all Philadelphians—roughly 246,000 people—had a physical, emotional, or cognitive disability in 2016, according to the latest data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. The share was the highest of the nation’s 10 largest cities, with only San Antonio coming close with a rate of 14.1 percent.

The data also show that American cities with high poverty rates tend to have higher rates of disabilities.

The Census Bureau defines a disability as “a long-lasting physical, mental, or emotional condition that can make it difficult for a person to do activities such as walking, climbing stairs, dressing, bathing, learning, or remembering; it can also impede a person from being able to go outside the home alone or to work at a job.”

The census also breaks the data into disability categories, which include hearing, vision, cognitive, and ambulatory (whether a person can walk). Although the 10 cities had similar shares of residents with hearing and vision challenges, Philadelphia stood out when it came to those with cognitive and ambulatory issues, with rates of 7.7 percent and 9.6 percent, respectively; some in the city reported that they experience both.

The census defines a cognitive disability as “a physical, mental, or emotional problem, having difficulty remembering, concentrating, or making decisions” and an ambulatory challenge as “having serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs.” The data are based on self-reporting by those surveyed; there is no information about the underlying condition causing the disability.

Research shows that many cognitive and ambulatory problems are driven by age. Thirty-two percent of disabled Philadelphians in 2016 were at least 65, and among residents older than 75, more than half—55 percent—reported a disability. The percentages of disabilities among older populations in the other cities were similar.

Philadelphia, however, had a higher share of adults ages 35 to 64 with cognitive or ambulatory difficulties. Nine percent of Philadelphians in this age group had cognitive issues, while most of the other largest cities had percentages below 5 percent. For those with ambulatory difficulties, the figure was nearly 13 percent for Philadelphia but 7 percent or less for most of the other cities.

Connections between disability and poverty

Nationally, nearly one-third of working-age adults who have a disability live below the poverty line. Figure 6 shows the 2016 disability rates for the 10 poorest cities with populations of at least 350,000. The average disability rate for these cities, each of which had a poverty rate of at least 22 percent, was 14.9 percent, compared with 10.8 percent for the 10 largest cities, most of which had poverty rates below 20 percent. Not surprisingly, the cities with the highest disability rates, Detroit and Cleveland, also had the highest poverty rates, which stood at about 35 percent for each in 2016. Those were the only two cities with disability rates higher than Philadelphia’s.

In Philadelphia in 2016, about 22 percent of the city’s poor were disabled, a higher share than in the rest of the 10 largest cities. Among the 10 poorest cities, only Cleveland had a higher share of disabled residents living in poverty (nearly 24 percent).

Depending on their incomes, many Philadelphians with disabilities receive government assistance through a range of programs; for example, more than 55,000 residents under age 65 qualify for Social Security disability benefits.

The city has various programs in place to support residents with disabilities, particularly those in poverty. In 2017, Mayor Jim Kenney established the Mayor’s Office for People With Disabilities to ensure Philadelphia’s adherence to the Americans With Disabilities Act. In addition, the Philadelphia Housing Development Corp. operates the Adaptive Modifications Program, which provides structural housing modifications for residents with permanent physical disabilities who meet income thresholds and other requirements. The program has a two-year waiting list.

Residents with cognitive disabilities also receive city support, including access to employment services, nursing care, residential support, and other forms of assistance from the Philadelphia Department of Behavioral Health and Intellectual disAbility Services (DBHIDS). Funding is provided by the federal and state governments, and the program is administered by the city.

As of March 2018, 4,144 city residents were receiving various levels of care through DBHIDS; because of the severity and nature of their disabilities, these individuals qualify for lifetime benefits. Another 2,119 people were on the waiting list.

An estimated 14 percent of the San Antonio population lives with a disability, according to census data from 2011-2015.

Meeting and interacting with new people outside one's everyday network can be a struggle for anyone, but is even more trying for individuals with mental or physical disabilities. Limited services and a lack of awareness or understanding widen the opportunity gap.

Socialization of a child, for example, is typically a natural phenomenon, but for kids developing on a different pace, making friends and forming relationships can be challenging.

Employees with disabilities may have a more difficult time adjusting to the workplace. Limited transportation options make it harder to maintain contact with family, friends and support networks.

How can San Antonio knock down barriers to inclusion for residents with disabilities?

The lawsuit also says inadequate infrastructure is an impediment to improving her condition, because it prevents her from building leg muscle by traveling the neighborhood using a wheeled gait trainer device.

The girl, described in the federal lawsuit as “C.R.” because she is a minor, says she wants the city to upgrade the sidewalks and curbs so she can have full and equal access to the neighborhood and its amenities.

The lawsuit says the city should have made such upgrades during road resurfacing projects completed since state accessibility standards were established in 1982 and since the federal Americans with Disabilities Act was approved in 1992.

In court documents, attorneys for San Diego say the city has complied with state and federal laws when the city’s actions are “viewed in their entirety.”

The city also claims that correcting the particular sidewalks and curbs mentioned in the suit would be an “unreasonable hardship,” describing them as “technical violations.”

San Diego faces dozens of sidewalk-related lawsuits each year, but they are typically prompted by injuries people suffer from tripping on uneven or cracked sidewalks.

This lawsuit claims there are multiple inadequate sidewalks and “curb cuts” on Rolando Boulevard, Solita Avenue, Aragon Drive and Lenore Drive. The area is southeast of San Diego State University.

The girl suffers from gross motor skill delays, cerebral palsy, a neurodevelopmental disorder called Wieacker-Wolff syndrome, and a joint condition called arthrogryposis.

The suit says she can’t walk or stand without assistance; she uses a gait trainer to get around. But she is often confined to her own block because the area lacks sloped curbs at intersections to accommodate wheeled devices.

“She is required to navigate steep driveways and proceed in the street alongside fast moving vehicles,” the lawsuit says.

In addition, she can’t comply with a doctor’s orders to aggressively use her gait trainer to build leg muscle and increase endurance. The suit says her house is too small to accommodate such arduous activity indoors.

Advertisement

The suit says that because of the inadequate infrastructure, she suffers from anxiety, fear, lack of independence, discrimination, discomfort and embarrassment.

The suit was filed by the girl’s legal guardian, Brian Russell.

U.S. Magistrate Judge Ruben Brooks has scheduled a settlement conference in the case for 9 a.m. on Oct. 15.

A spokeswoman for City Attorney Mara Elliott said Monday that the city will respond to the suit through the courts. The lawsuit was filed July 26.",[]
https://www.dallasnews.com/news/2017/09/26/dallas-child-poverty-rate-drops-but-still-high-compared-to-other-major-u-s-cities/,['Dallas'],"Dallas' child poverty rate drops, but still high compared to other major U.S. cities","Dallas is no longer home to highest percentage of children living in poverty in major U.S. cities, according to new estimates released by the U.S. Census Bureau.

The Mayor's Poverty Task Force on Tuesday announced that the rate has fallen over the last three years. From 2014 to 2016, the American Community Survey's estimates showed that 26,000 fewer Dallas children are living in poverty — dropping the rate to 30.6 percent from 37.8 percent. The overall poverty rate also fell, and the city has a relatively low rate among residents 65 and older.

But the decrease in child poverty still left Dallas tied with Phoenix for the third-worst such rate among major U.S. cities. And the city also continues to have a fairly high overall poverty rate.

""We have started progress. We've got some good trends going,"" said Regina Montoya, the task force's co-chair. ""But the trends have to continue because we've got a big issue in front of us.""

It's unclear exactly why the estimated numbers fell in Dallas. Other large cities — such as Houston, Austin, San Antonio, Los Angeles and San Diego — reported similar drops, suggesting larger economic trends were a factor, although Philadelphia's rate, which is now the worst in major U.S. cities, remained virtually the same. And median income in Dallas rose in those years, although not as fast as it did in other cities.

Montoya said the so-called living-wage requirements of city contractors and Parkland Memorial Hospital's minimum wage increase might have helped make a dent in Dallas. And she said Dallas ISD initiatives have helped students and their parents.

She said the poverty task force's work has shown that the city's various government agencies can't continue a ""business as usual"" approach.

For the most part, Dallas City Hall has not. The poverty rates and what Mayor Mike Rawlings has described as the city's ""barbell economy"" — a glut of rich and poor residents with few in the middle class — have loomed over City Hall for years.

City leaders have made efforts to reverse that. This year, the city created the Office of Welcoming Communities and Immigrant Affairs because one in four Dallas residents is foreign-born and may not seek out city services, such as free income tax preparation.

The City Council also recently approved a budget that includes a living wage for all city employees, as well as $287,000 for an English-as-a-second-language program and $300,000 for a teen pregnancy initiative. The task force has reported that teen pregnancy and the language barrier are two of the biggest factors in poverty.

The council — driven in part by a feeling that Dallas Area Rapid Transit had given the working poor the short shrift in Dallas — installed new DART board members. They've long weighed banning employers from inquiring about criminal histories on initial job applications. And they've raised housing standards and have pushed for more affordable housing in the city.

But progress on those fronts will take time. Council member Mark Clayton, a co-chair of the task force, said he is pleased with the city's efforts so far.

""The task force gave voice to what we all knew but didn't know how to define,"" Clayton said. ""Once we knew how to define what the problem was, it allowed us to ask the right questions.""

One anecdotal sign of progress Clayton has seen is that prominent nonprofit officials, City Council members, Dallas ISD officials and other civic leaders are showing up more to the task force meetings and trying to get involved.

""The audience is bigger and higher-level than it has ever been,"" he said.

At Tuesday's meeting, Dallas ISD Superintendent Michael Hinojosa touted the district's efforts to grow pre-K enrollment, expand early college programs, integrate students from different economic backgrounds and help homeless children receive services.

Hinojosa bemoaned the failure of the board of trustees to allow voters a chance to raise taxes — and provide between $42 million and $123 million more dollars for the school district. He vowed to try again to pass the increase.

""If you don't have any new money, that means people are going to be competing for the money you have,"" Hinojosa said. ""And there are winners and losers, and that's what creates the complexity I live in every single day.""

Clayton said Dallas ISD, City Hall and other government agencies need more analytics on the drivers of poverty and whether their programs are having any impact. He said the data has helped already, but it's difficult to fund programs on a larger scale until officials can prove they are working. Clayton said programs can't be funded ""off a hunch.""

Still, the task force and the focus on poverty in recent years will make a difference.

""We're light-years ahead of where we were a few years ago,"" Clayton said. ""We're not going to work off the hunch anymore. We're going to work off the numbers.""",[]

https://www.modernhealthcare.com/providers/tradition-bound-healthcare-learning-few-things-austins-innovation-focused-atmosphere,['Austin'],Tradition-bound healthcare is learning a few things in Austin’s innovation-focused atmosphere,"South by Southwest—the hip Austin, Texas, festival known for bringing together new music, films and technologies—hosted an unexpected guest this year: the American Hospital Association.

AHA leaders sat on panels related to access to care, innovative partnerships and “must-haves” for future healthcare leaders at the 2019 event, which took place March 8-17.

The AHA’s presence marked the first time the association officially participated in sessions at SXSW, though some teams attended the event last year.

“We wanted to offer the public a view of how hospitals and health systems are redefining the 'H' to better serve their communities,” said Dr. Jay Bhatt, AHA’s senior vice president and chief medical officer, who sat on a panel about telehealth and in-home care.

SXSW, a 32-year-old festival which started as a regional event to celebrate Austin’s art community, added its Health & MedTech track in 2014 to reflect the city’s growing healthcare market, according to Hugh Forrest, SXSW’s chief programming officer.

Fast-forward to 2019, and the festival is hosting 100-plus sessions on the track, with sponsorship from Kaiser Permanente and participation from major hospital groups. Modern Healthcare has also been a part of SXSW, with Publisher Fawn Lopez participating in a 2017 panel on advances in healthcare technology.

The health addition puts SXSW in competition with some of healthcare’s long-established players. “2018 was a little bit challenging because the HIMSS event in Las Vegas literally backed up to our event, with their last day being the first day of SXSW,” Forrest said. “One of the biggest lessons we’ve learned is that we can get a lot more buy-in when we’re not backed up against one of these really big events.”",[]
https://www.news4jax.com/health/2018/01/26/initiative-aims-to-bring-health-care-to-jacksonville-students-most-in-need/,['Jacksonville'],Initiative aims to bring health care to Jacksonville students most in need,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. – A new health care initiative is taking doctors to students in Northwest Jacksonville.

In addition to two local school-based health centers, Baptist Health and Wolfson Children's Hospital teamed up to expand the Ribault Family Resource Center.

The new centers benefit students and their families by cutting the travel time needed to receive proper health care.

Baptist Health found that less than 5 percent of children and adults living in the 32208 and 32209 ZIP codes have seen a primary care doctor.

That's why Baptist Health and Wolfson Children's Hospital teamed up with other community organizations to expand the Ribault Family Resource Center on Ribault High's campus.

It's part of the new school-based health centers that bring doctors to students, which means more access to health care.

Students will be able to see full-time pediatricians and practitioners just steps away from a classroom, regardless of the family's ability to pay. That's in addition to a mental health program that's already on campus.

The initiative goes way beyond a typical school nurse clinic.

""It becomes their medical home, their primary care office,” said Hugh Green, CEO of Baptist Health. “It will give them preventive care, immunizations, all the things that are needed.""

The in-school health centers inside Ribault High and Ribault Middle are staffed by licensed health care professionals who currently serve the students with their parents' consent.

Starting in February, the Family Resource Center will serve all children under 21 in the community.

Major donors and federal grants will continue to fund the health care centers.",[]
https://www.healthcareitnews.com/news/miami-health-system-partners-philips-patient-monitoring,['Miami'],Miami health system partners with Philips on patient monitoring,"Royal Philips and Miami-based Jackson Health System, one of the largest public health systems in the U.S., have forged an 11-year pact to develop Enterprise Monitoring as a Service.

The EMasS model calls for continuous patient monitoring across the network, and is designed to support Jackson's efforts to improve patient safety, officials said.

According to officials, the partnership will provide those services on a per-patient fee basis, a model that eliminates up-front costs while making it possible for Jackson to standardize patient monitoring at all acuity levels across its network.

Instead of the health system owning the patient care monitoring system, the model will give ownership to Philips, which is responsible for hardware, software and the network, officials said.

Philips will provide technical support, help identify clinical workflow optimization opportunities, continuing education, asset and data management. Officials said it will also help Jackson design solutions that integrate with core IT systems, such as Jackson's EHR.

""Patient safety is paramount and trying to balance patient safety with the rapidly changing technology landscape requires innovative business models and a true partnership that will allow us to manage our IT needs, while enhancing our quality of care,"" Jackson Health CEO Carlos A. Migoya, said in a statement.

""This model will assist our drive for operational and clinical excellence through best practices, continuing education, and shared accountability,” he added.

The partnership will also give Jackson Health access to other technologies, such as the Wearable Biosensor, on a per patient basis. Jackson could also customize solutions to specific clinical needs.

As Vitor Rocha, CEO of Philips North America, sees it, by applying the software-as-a-service model, Philips and the health system are re-inventing how health systems adopt technology and future-proofing their patient-monitoring technology.

Philips has signed similar long-term agreements with Augusta University Health, Westchester Medical Center Health Network, Mackenzie Health, Marin General Hospital, the Medical University of South Carolina Health, Banner Health, Bon Secours, Phoenix Children's Hospital, and Children's Hospital & Medical Center Omaha.

District leaders are hoping a new health care center will give residents in Southeast D.C. more access to needed services.

Whitman-Walker Health has signed a lease to bring a new 116,000 square-foot facility to the St. Elizabeths East Campus.

The facility will provide services like dental, primary, behavioral and substance misuse treatment care for residents in Congress Heights in Ward 8. It will also include a ground-floor pharmacy, office space for faculty and a new home for Whitman-Walker’s Youth Services.

The goal is to expand on services already being provided at the nonprofit’s Max Robinson Center in Southeast by tripling the number of patients seen annually to 15,000.

Whitman-Walker will be the first new tenant on the campus, which will also welcome The R.I.S.E. Demonstration Center, Gateway DC Pavilion and the Entertainment and Sports Arena.

The health care facility will be built on a vacant site that faces Alabama Avenue at Sycamore Drive, SE near the Congress Heights Metro station.

During the announcement of the new facility, Mayor Muriel Bowser said the project marks a milestone in the redevelopment of the St. Elizabeths Campus.

“This new, state-of-the-art health care facility will help us ensure that Washingtonians in every corner of DC can access the services they need, right in their communities,” she added.

The new health care center is expected to be completed in 2023.",[]
https://www.wabe.org/street-medicine-brings-healthcare-to-atlantas-homeless/,['Atlanta'],Street Medicine Brings Health Care To Atlanta’s Homeless,"It’s late afternoon, and a large van sits idling in the hot sun on a street corner in southwest Atlanta near where Interstate-20 crosses over Whitehall Street.

Herman Ware sits surrounded by medical supplies at a wobbly table in the vehicle. He’s taking a break from the mid-September heat, as nurse Stephanie Dotson prepares to give him a flu shot.

“Well it might sting, yeah, I figured that,” Ware says in anticipation.

Ware has been living under the interstate for a few months now. The Army veteran says he’s doing alright, save for the occasional aches and pains.

His big problem these days? Mosquitoes. So, Dotson gives him some insect repellent as she sends him on his way.

“Take care! I got that flu shot out the way,” Dotson calls after Ware as he steps off the bus.

Interactions like these can be rare for people experiencing homelessness. For those trying to find a hot meal or a place to sleep, health can take a backseat.

That’s where street medicine programs come in, such as the one run by Mercy Care since 2013. Four days a week, the clinic sends medical teams to spots in the city where homeless people gather to offer a range of services.

Gaining Trust

Nurse practitioner Joy Fernandez de Narayan has been doing this work, off and on, for about five years. She stands outside the van greeting patients as MARTA trains pass on tracks nearby.

“When we’re coming out here to talk to people, we’re on their turf,” she said.

That means she can never assume people want her help, whether that’s a vaccination or a snack

“We’ll sit down next to someone, like ‘How’s the weather treating you?’ And then kind of work our way into: ‘You mentioned you had a history of high blood pressure. Do you mind if we check your blood pressure?’” de Narayan said.

She says it can take several encounters to gain someone’s trust and get them into care.

The medical team also has to get creative with the remedies they prescribe, because simple things can be hard to come by.

“Such simple things,” de Narayan said. ‘“You go to the doctor, because you have a sore throat, and they’re like, ‘Gargle warm salt water.’ Well, out here, it’s like, ‘Ok, well where am I going to get water?’”

But those limitations don’t stop the street medicine team from helping people.

Sopain Lawson has been living in this spot under I-20 for most of the summer. That’s where she developed a foot fungus that sidelined her for an entire month.

“I couldn’t walk. I needed help. I had to stay off my feet,” Lawson said. “And the crew, they took good care of my foot. They got me back.”

Lawson attributes her recovery to weekly visits from the street medicine team. She’s friendly with the practitioners and hugs de Narayan before walking off.

“This is what street medicine is about: going out into these areas where people are not going to seek attention until it’s an emergency,” said Matthew Reed, a social worker with the group. “We’re trying to avoid emergencies, but we’re also trying to build relationships.”

As a freight train rolls by, Reed says those relationships are crucial. They help the street medicine team convince people to seek out other services: mental health counseling, dentistry, even housing.

‘Go To The People’

There are dozens of similar programs around the country, according to the Street Medicine Institute.

Dr. Jim Withers is medical director of the group. He started making house calls to the homeless in 1992 with Pittsburgh Mercy’s Operation Safety Net. Mercy Care is part of the same Catholic parent organization, Trinity Health.

“Health care likes people to come to it on its terms,” Withers said. “The philosophical central point of street medicine is: go to the people.”

Doing that work in Atlanta costs Mercy Care about $900,000 a year. The clinic estimates its street medicine helped at least 300 people connect to care in 2018.

These programs are important, Withers says, because the health care system isn’t reaching people who are homeless.

“There’s all these populations: they’re still sick, they’re still coming to the emergency rooms, and we’re not dealing with them well,” he said. “They stay in the hospital longer. They have more complications.”

And that care costs a lot of money. One recent estimate says Atlanta’s homeless population racks up more than $60 million in emergency room visits and hospital stays.

“The sickest patients require the most time and effort. That’s true regardless of whether the person is housed or homeless,” said Dr. Stephen Hwang, who studies homelessness and health at St. Michael’s Hospital in Toronto.

Hwang says it’s not clear if street medicine has a large-scale impact. Instead, he says each personal interaction can add up.

“Every encounter that they have on the street with someone is actually, in and of itself, an indicator of effectiveness,” he said.

It’s twilight as the Mercy Care team pulls up to its final stop of the night, Central Presbyterian Church in downtown Atlanta.

A handful of people settle down for the night on the sidewalk as traffic whizzes by on Washington Street.

Among them is Johnny Dunson, a frequent street medicine patient who talks with members of the street medicine team like they’re old friends.

“You gotta’ let someone know how you’re feeling, understand me? It’s a lot of people that need some kind of assistance to do what you’re supposed to be doing, and they do a wonderful job,” he said.

Dunson says the Mercy Care team gives him the help he needs, and they do it with respect. Living out here, it can be hard to find either.",[]

As local media outlets participate in the #Seahomeless day of coverage, State of Reform decided to elevate the health care needs of our homeless population, and the barriers they experience when trying to accessing care.

The Healthcare for the Homeless Network (HCHN) is part of Seattle Public Health Department. In its Community Needs Assessment 2016-17 report, HCHN features data from its patient population of over 20,000 individuals, performance measurement data from over 200 providers, and reports from the local Homeless Management Information System.

HCHN also includes information gathered from Listening Sessions with 101 individuals who are currently homeless or were homeless in the past year and from surveys and interviews with HCHN providers.

Current health care needs for people experiencing homelessness are grouped into five categories: basic needs, chronic disease management, chronic pain, dental care, and vision care.

Comments from the Listening Sessions revealed the challenges of living with a chronic condition, accessing care, and remaining healthy:

“With diabetes, you try to figure out how to test your blood sugar daily and store everything.” “There is something wrong with my stent (heart disease) but I’m not going back in for help. There is nowhere safe or clean to come back to. Disease and stuff spreads like wildfire in shelters.” “I never get enough sleep. Been woken up 6 to 7 times in a night. I’m always dealing with issues. Constant pain from sleeping all curled up.”

Individuals experiencing homeless often experience three phases of delays in accessing and utilizing care.

Individuals explained the challenges of finding accurate resource lists, having gaps in care or documentation, and being turned feeling unwelcomed:

“You all need to keep the resource lists simple and up to date. It’s easy to give up after all the run around and dead ends.” “You move around a lot being homeless, lose paperwork and things, and you have to get care at a new clinic. They may not cover or offer the same things. You end up with a gap in care.” “One experience of being turned away was enough. You can tell when people are judging you, just want you to go away.”

Providers described the health care needs they see in the homeless population:

Severity of medical needs that accumulate the longer individuals and families remain homeless in King County.

Sheer level of co-occurring behavioral health needs, especially opioid dependence and untreated mental health conditions.

Drug resistance for multiple conditions and challenges in prescribing treatments without full health history.

Growing elderly homeless population who present with early onset of geriatric conditions and cognitive impairments.

Assuring access to prenatal care, reproductive health, family planning, and early intervention services.

In order to improve health outcomes and improve access to care, providers would like to see partnerships, policy and system change that lead to:",[]
https://www.sfchronicle.com/restaurants/article/City-s-health-care-initiative-shows-success-12300530.php#photo-14387093,['San Francisco'],"City’s health care initiative shows success, but questions remain","Even as the national debate over access to health care insurance continues to rage, San Francisco has quietly become a city where nearly every resident is covered.

That achievement is due in part to the San Francisco Health Care Security Ordinance, one of the country’s most innovative, and most hotly debated, health care initiatives. When it took effect in January 2008, requiring businesses with 20 or more employees to contribute money toward their health care expenditures, 10.4 percent of San Franciscans — 15 percent of the working-age population — were uninsured.

As the program’s 10-year anniversary approaches, the ordinance, together with the federal Affordable Care Act, appears to have helped close that gap almost entirely.

According to the U.S. Census’ 2016 American Community Survey, 96.7 percent of San Franciscans now have health care coverage, well over the statewide average of 92.7 percent. When you add in the City Option, a program created by the ordinance that provides limited health care services for 13,500 uninsured residents and manages medical reimbursement accounts for 186,000 others, that figure brushes up against 100 percent.

“The two work incredibly well together,” Supervisor Hillary Ronen said of the federal and municipal laws.

Along with that success, though, some significant issues have surfaced.

Perhaps the biggest is the fate of one aspect of the City Option, a growing pool of money that employers have placed in medical reimbursement accounts, or MRAs, for workers to help cover what insurance does not. Those funds, managed by the city’s Department of Public Health, now amount to $160 million, The Chronicle has learned, not including another $17 million in more than 28,000 accounts deemed inactive and recently closed for lack of use.

The growing pool of MRA money, along with the thousands of accounts so far made inactive, suggests that many workers are not using their accounts fully or at all. The average amount in each individual account is $1,478, the Public Health Department says, but the average annual claim amounts to less than a third of that, $441.

And while the city is obligated to retain the MRA funds for the use of enrolled employees only, health plan officials are currently reviewing just how the accounts, both active and inactive, will be managed going forward.

Some question whether the city and some employers are doing enough to educate workers about accessing the funds set aside for them. Others have wondered if the city has properly reconciled the requirements of the ordinance and the Affordable Care Act, which has provided much of what San Francisco’s initiative was meant to do.

Meanwhile, the city has not publicized any data demonstrating the program’s successes and problems. The San Francisco Health Plan, which oversees the City Option for the Department of Public Health, has not been required to publish figures on its usage. The city’s Office of Labor Standards Enforcement is supposed to put out annual reports showing Health Care Security Ordinance contributions, but the last published report is from 2013.

The City Option “is essentially a stopgap solution that has become institutionalized,” said Micah Weinberg, president of the Bay Area Council Economic Institute. “When we passed the Health Care Security Ordinance, the idea was this is what we needed to get to the passage of the ACA or some other health care legislation. But it is rare that government programs are put in place and then they go away.”

The City Option was created, alongside the Health Care Security Ordinance, to provide two separate patches for health care coverage gaps. It would channel employer set-aside funds to Healthy San Francisco, which provides services to San Francisco residents, or to the MRAs, which anyone who worked for a qualifying San Francisco business could have.

After the Affordable Care Act expanded Medi-Cal coverage in 2013, the number participating in Healthy San Francisco dropped from nearly 60,000 to 13,500. The city’s administrative costs shrank as well, from $159.9 million in 2013-14 to $74.4 million in 2015-16.

According to the San Francisco Office of Labor Standards Enforcement, in 2016, employers affected by the ordinance spent 89 percent of their set-aside funds, about $2.05 billion, on insurance premiums. The remaining 11 percent went toward privately managed MRAs and City Option programs.

In 2014, the Board of Supervisors closed a loophole in the 2008 ordinance that had allowed employers to reclaim funds they’d paid into private MRAs after two years if workers hadn’t used them. Since January, 100 percent of those funds must be held in perpetuity.

Part-time and low-income workers, particularly in the retail and hospitality sectors, are more likely to have MRAs rather than full insurance. Many others use their reimbursement accounts in conjunction with high-deductible coverage plans.

The City Option, say workers who do use it, provides a much-needed boost to cover health care costs.

Damon Bird, 39, and his partner, Lauren Loiselle, are both cicerones, the beer equivalent of sommeliers. When they moved to San Francisco from Dallas three years ago, they discovered their new restaurant jobs came with a major perk: health insurance for the couple, plus a medical reimbursement account, which allowed Bird to have much-needed hernia surgery he had put off for years.

In Texas, he was paying more than $300 a month for an insurance plan with a $6,000 deductible. Saving enough money for surgery was impossible.

In San Francisco, Loiselle’s job as the manager of a Mission bar and restaurant offered her and Bird health insurance with a much lower deductible. Bird asked his employer at the time to contribute his own health care funds to an MRA. Last year, the account had accrued enough money for Bird to have the operation. His final out-of-pocket cost: $500.

“It was pretty miraculous,” he said recently.

According to the Department of Public Health, the City Option’s MRA program has paid out $244 million in claims since its founding in 2008.

After nearly 10 years, the reimbursement process appears to work well for those who have figured it out.

Lindsay Stripling, an artist and the manager at Outerlands restaurant in the Outer Sunset, pays for a Kaiser HMO plan out of pocket and then uses the City Option to cover expenses like orthopedic shoes and root canals. She receives a quarterly statement from her employer letting her know how much money has been transferred into the account. She submits receipts for medical expenses through the City Option website, receiving a check within a few days.

She has become a City Option evangelist to co-workers and friends. But, she cautioned, “You have to be on top of it yourself and show incentive to save your receipts. If you don’t use (the account), the money is stagnant.”

Bird concurs. His employer didn’t know enough about the program to help him access the funds in his name, so he went to the office of the San Francisco Health Plan, which oversees the City Option for the Department of Public Health.

“It’s confusing, and unless you spend some time with it, no one has any clear answers,” Bird said.

Language barriers may be one factor, despite the fact that the program’s website, as well as its print educational materials, are available in English, Chinese (spoken Cantonese), Tagalog and Spanish.

Shaw San Liu of the Chinese Progressive Association said his organization, which often counsels non-English-speaking workers in the restaurant industry, said: “Nine times out of 10, talking to workers eligible for an account, they didn’t know about it and it was difficult to access.”

Colleen Chawla, deputy director of the San Francisco Department of Public Health, said, “I feel like restaurant owners or other employers have a role in making employees know they’re making contributions on their behalf. Employers, if they’re making that contribution, I’m sure they want their employees to use it.”

But not many employers, it appears, are seeking help in accessing the program. The San Francisco Health Plan has six program administrators available for telephone and in-person training for employers and workers. Agency staffers, though, say they receive relatively few requests from employers each month.

Employers, meanwhile, particularly in the restaurant industry, continue to complain that the ordinance deters some businesses from adding staff for fear of incurring the ordinance’s requirements.

While the amount of unused MRA funds surprised her, Supervisor Hillary Ronen said the fact that individual accounts are not being fully accessed does not trouble her.

Many of the lowest-cost health insurance plans carry huge deductibles, she said, creating a gap that MRA funds can fill. “Sure, they might not go to a doctor now,” Ronen said, “but if they get into a car accident and have huge bills, they could use up their MRA in one day.”

Last year, the city decided to deactivate the accounts of employees who had not spent any funds for two years or did not respond to multiple notices warning them their accounts might be closed.

Greg Wagner, chief financial officer for the Public Health Department, emphasized that the money in those accounts will remain within the City Option program, as required by ordinance. City controller Ben Rosenfield confirmed that the funds will remain in the San Francisco Health Plan’s budget, and won’t end up in any other part of the city’s funds. Officials say participants only need to call to reinstate an account.

“The San Francisco Health Plan is currently in the process of doing an actuarial review to figure out, of those dollars, how much of that (amount) is likely to have people come back and reopen the account,” Wagner said.

The city will hold a pool in reserve for those reopened accounts and pass any excess to the other parts of the program.

Ronen said she was glad to hear that the San Francisco Health Plan is accruing more information about how people use the accounts.

“It will be really useful to look at the data,” Ronen said. “How is this working? Did we move in the right direction? Do we need to tweak things?”

https://detroitisit.com/healthcare-southwest-detroit-guzman-chass-center/,['Detroit'],Why Getting to Healthcare is an Issue in Southwest Detroit,"Ricardo Guzman is the founder of CHASS Center, a community healthcare center that has operated for 50 years through the last half of the 20th Century in Detroit’s Hispanic-American Neighborhoods.

Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer announced last month that Sept 15 – Oct 15 will be a state-wide Hispanic Heritage Month. Although it’s already a nation-wide month of celebration, the state of Michigan holds a unique history that situates Hispanic Communities at the center of its urban story.

Because while Detroit’s general population was declining, its Southwest neighborhoods were flourishing.

Immigrants have always found a home in Detroit. With the steady stream of population growth offsetting some of its mass depopulation of the late 20th century, Mexicantown was no exception with massive amounts of Hispanic immigrants calling Detroit home.

Throughout the steady decline, Mexicantown maintained a vibrant community within its borders. Bakeries and restaurants became major destinations for people throughout the entire Southeast Michigan region. Relevant cultural expressions throughout the neighborhood became a way for people to feel at home again once they left their home country, and oftentimes families behind.

Despite the vibrant neighborhood’s steady population, many services left the neighborhood. Hospitals and physicians left for the suburbs or more central locations closer to downtown Detroit. And for the people living in Mexicantown, this became a dire problem.

Ricardo Guzman is a lifelong resident of Mexicantown. When Detroit’s services dried up, Guzman worked against the declining health system for his ill mother. Unfortunately, due to this lack of access to healthcare, she did pass away.

Guzman believes it is a result of her death that the community came together to build CHASS Center. Working as a health clinic for low-income and impoverished people, CHASS created a system revolutionary for its time. An intersection of innovative ideas and culture-based care resulted in a community that would have access to healthcare for everyone in the neighborhood.

The beginnings of a healthcare revolution

Within a period of four years, the biggest hospitals around Southwest Detroit shut down along with the other businesses in the area. Leaving people without immediate healthcare in a with a loss of jobs and businesses. So the long distances to emergency rooms and regular healthcare mattered for people without vehicles who couldn’t depend on public transportation.

“When they left, people around the community started asking ‘Where are we going to go for our healthcare?’” Guzman said. “We were at a crossroads because there was no real answer.”

Guzman said this was a unique time for a clinic like CHASS. During the 1970s – a time when progressive ideas in fighting poverty were shared among both conservative and liberal politicians – federal funders saw major promise in a free clinic.

In 1969, the meetings started with the people in office at the time. Under the Republican administration of Michigan Governor Bob Milliken, the first grants came which helped establish the clinic out of a house rented from a local area church.

The innovative portion for the time was in creating a “one-stop-shop” for healthcare and social services. Someone who needed any healthcare assistance could go to one place.

“The powers that be really liked that someone could go to one location and get health services, get social services, get some training that was available,” Guzman said. “And that’s where it really took off for us because it was something new and they really liked that idea.”

CHASS as an innovative healthcare model

What made CHASS an important part of the healthcare network in Detroit may have been what it couldn’t do. Community Health Clinics are always wondering what happens if someone comes in that needs care beyond the scope of what they could provide, according to Guzman. This is where an important partnership was formed.

A study was done on emergency room usage among the various populations around Detroit. It found that Hispanic Americans in Southwest Detroit were saying that they come to CHASS for everything, including emergencies. From their office, CHASS could send dire emergencies to emergency rooms around the city.

Guzman referred to CHASS as a “Gatekeeper” for the emergency room. Because most people were using the emergency rooms of Henry Ford Hospital and the DNC for general health issues instead of for most pressing emergencies, then CEO of Henry Ford Hospital Gail Warden took a serious interest in CHASS for the role it could play.

“HFHS really understood the relationship between a community health center as a primary care provider and an emergency room,” Guzman said.

A partnership between them now became a way for CHASS to have access to doctors and physicians from the Henry Ford Hospital.

CHASS became a uniquely hispanic health center

Most doctors at CHASS speak Spanish with their patients. And for a population of native speakers and,

oftentimes monolingual Spanish speakers, this gave CHASS an important role within the community.

In the time before CHASS came into being, the entire neighborhood had around six businesses owned by Hispanic Americans, according to Guzman. Throughout the ‘70s and ‘80s, the entrepreneurial spirit of the Hispanic community flourished with Hispanic people growing businesses along the main stretches of the neighborhood. A business network that would eventually christen the Southwest neighborhood ‘Mexicantown.’

But this didn’t come without its struggles. Immigration officials would oftentimes come to C

HASS looking for people slated for deportation. And like many other entities in the neighborhood, CHASS would protect the identities of everyone.

“In the past, we’ve had people come in asking if someone is in the center,” Guzman said. “And everyone at the front desk knew what to do, which is call me up and I’d come and talk to them.”

Guzman depended on the laws protecting patients’ privacy to make sure that people wouldn’t risk deportation at his health center.

Although immigration status remains at the center of national debates, the CHASS Center had to depend on laws protecting patients’ rights over the laws governing immigration status at the time. Those same laws could have revoked the center’s license to operate if it complied with immigration officials.

The CHASS Center will be 50 years old next year. And although it o

perates as a free clinic, the constantly changing demographic of the neighborhood means that CHASS will have to change with it. Even now, budget worries make these changes seem inevitable as the model for funding community health centers becomes too difficult to predict.

What may happen is that CHASS becomes a regular health office for people with insurance. Yet still, it stands that the neighborhood would not have been the same without its history of community members providing for each other.

Whether it’s in healthcare, social services or just being a good neighbor, CHASS made a model that carried Southwest Detroit’s Hispanic Community through some of the most difficult times in the city’s history. And it all started in a house rented from a church. And a man with a caring vision.",[]

I decided that, on a day when temperatures dip into the -30 degree range in the Twin Cities (and that isn’t even taking wind chill into consideration), it might be a good time to address the question, “why would anyone want to live there?”

In his article for the current edition of the Washington Monthly, Daniel Block notes that Minneapolis/St. Paul is one of the only metro areas in the heartland with a growing population. He contrasts that with the greater Milwaukee area of Wisconsin.

In 2016, the rural parts of both states shifted sharply to the right, matching the national trend. Minnesota, however, stayed blue, while Wisconsin went red. To understand why, take a look at the growth rates of the states’ largest metro areas, both of which voted heavily for Clinton. Between 1970 and 2017, Greater Minneapolis grew at an annual rate of roughly 2 percent, above the national rate of 1.1 percent. The Minneapolis region—home to a variety of corporate giants like Target—now has roughly 3.6 million residents, up from 1.87 million in 1970. By contrast, Greater Milwaukee, buffeted by business closures and a shrinking middle class, grew at an annual rate of only 0.26 percent over the same period.

If, as Block suggests, population growth in major metropolitan areas is critical for Democrats, it is important to try to understand what makes the Minneapolis/St. Paul area such an outlier in the midwest.

Someone who has been studying that for a while now is Myles Shaver, a professor at the University of Minnesota’s Carlson School of Management. You can watch him present his findings in a video here, where he explains what his research says about why the Twin Cities are home to 18 Fortune 500 companies—more than any other metro area its size. As he told Derek Thompson, “We’re not like Atlanta, where half of its Fortune 500s moved there. There is something about Minneapolis that makes us unusually good at building and keeping large companies.” He went on to explain why that happens.

Shaver’s theory, which he’s developing into a book, is that Minneapolis is so successful at turning medium-size companies into giants because its most important resource never leaves the city: educated managers of every level, who can work at just about any company…“It bears out the old adage: ‘It’s really hard to get people to move to Minneapolis, and it’s impossible to get them to leave.’ ”

As part of his research, Shaver interviewed about 2,700 of those educated managers and identified the factors that were both least and most important in their decision to live in the Minneapolis area. The least important included things like college/professional sports, tax rates, and cultural events. The most important factors were:

Job opportunities

Strong local economy

Good place to raise children

Quality public schools

Quality health care

Drilling down a bit deeper, Shaver found that 85 percent of people in the managerial class sent their children to public schools—something that would be unheard of in most metro areas.

That brings us to the heart of what some people have called “the Minneapolis miracle.” The confidence people have in the area’s public schools is one effect of a law passed back in the 1970s called the “Fiscal Disparities Act.”

In the 1960s, local districts and towns in the Twin Cities region offered competing tax breaks to lure in new businesses, diminishing their revenues and depleting their social services in an effort to steal jobs from elsewhere within the area. In 1971, the region came up with an ingenious plan that would help halt this race to the bottom, and also address widening inequality. The Minnesota state legislature passed a law requiring all of the region’s local governments—in Minneapolis and St. Paul and throughout their ring of suburbs—to contribute almost half of the growth in their commercial tax revenues to a regional pool, from which the money would be distributed to tax-poor areas. Today, business taxes are used to enrich some of the region’s poorest communities.

No other metro region in the country has ever replicated that strategy, but in 2015 Chicago’s Metropolitan Planning Council wanted to know why Minneapolis was growing at almost five times the rate of their city. They came up with three reasons:

The Fiscal Disparities Act Education Quality of life

Notice that both education and quality of life are largely dependent on the funding formula in the Fiscal Disparities Act.

The 1970s were a long time ago and it could be hard to convince other metropolitan areas to adopt the redistribution of commercial tax revenue that has been fueling growth in the Twin Cities area for decades now. But I suspect that many of them would identify with what the Chicago Metropolitan Planning Council found.

Northeastern Illinois municipalities have a bad habit of giving away tax revenues to lure businesses to move from one suburb to the next or from a suburb to the City of Chicago, because they believe it will grow their overall tax base and create jobs locally. But this is often done without assessing the overall economic impact to the region and the effect is only a relocation of jobs, not net new job growth. Businesses are at an advantage because they know communities will compete for them. The Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning finds that in the Chicago region, “Local governments are spending or committing significant amounts of incentive dollars to firms that may generate sales tax revenues, but have low jobs multipliers and/or low wages.” In other words, municipalities give up revenue that is supposed to go to public services or schools, and often no new net job growth is created regionally.

It is that race to the bottom to give away tax revenues for meager job growth at low wages that is debilitating to a community’s quality of life. That is what the Minneapolis/St. Paul area figured out forty years ago and what continues to fuel its growth today. It certainly isn’t the weather.",[]
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-disparities-academic-hospitals/few-poor-or-minority-patients-in-new-york-citys-academic-hospitals-idUSKBN15O25O,['New York'],Few poor or minority patients in New York City’s academic hospitals,"(Reuters Health) - Black patients are half as likely as white patients to get care at academic medical centers in New York City even after accounting for differences in health insurance, a recent study suggests.

Compared to privately insured patients, people with coverage through Medicaid, the government health program for the poor, are three times less likely to receive treatment at these elite New York hospitals, the study also found. Uninsured patients are five times less likely to get care at academic hospitals.

“Academic medical centers are generally better able to provide highly specialized care for patients with complex or rare illnesses,” said lead study author Roosa Sofia Tikkanen, a researcher at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester who completed the work while at City University of New York School of Public Health at Hunter College.

“Most experts believe unequal access to high-quality health care contributes to disparities in health outcomes,” Tikkanen added by email. “In New York City, life expectancy can differ by up to 10 years between two neighborhoods that are located just six subway stops apart.”

About 18 percent of patients at academic medical centers are black, compared with almost one-third at other hospitals in the city, the analysis of discharge data from 2009 and 2014 found.

At the same time, 22 percent of patients were insured by Medicaid at academic hospitals, compared with 42 percent at other hospitals in the city. And only 1 percent of academic hospital patients were uninsured, compared with 4 percent elsewhere.

While Medicaid and uninsured patients accounted for nearly half of all patients at non-academic hospitals in the city, they made up less than one-quarter of inpatients at academic medical centers. At one-third of academic hospitals, less than 10 percent of patients had Medicaid or were uninsured.

To see how race, ethnicity and payer status affect the likelihood of being treated at an academic medical center, researchers analyzed data on adults discharged from hospitals in New York City in 2009 and 2014, and they also looked at similar data for Boston hospitals in 2009.

In Boston, uninsured and Medicaid patients were just as likely to be treated at academic medical centers as at other hospitals. And racial and ethnic minorities were slightly overrepresented at academic hospitals.

It’s possible some of the differences between the two cities might be explained by the extensive public hospital network in New York, the authors note in the International Journal of Health Services.

All of the academic medical centers in Boston and New York are nonprofit hospitals, however, and enjoy tax exemptions worth tens of millions of dollars, the researchers point out. In exchange, they are expected to provide community benefits, including caring for Medicaid and uninsured patients.

One limitation of the study is that researchers didn’t account for patients’ diagnoses or severity of illnesses, which could influence which hospital they went to for care, the authors add. The analysis of two cities also might not reflect what happens in other communities.

The study also didn’t examine the role of residential segregation or neighborhood poverty on use of academic medical centers, noted Asal Mohamadi Johnson, a public health researcher at Stetson University in Florida who wasn’t involved in the study.

“The issue of equity and fairness is at stake here,” Johnson said by email. “Academic medical centers should be held to higher levels of ethical standards in providing care for low income and minority patients.”

When there are disparities in patients’ access to care, academic medical centers may not offer the best possible education to new doctors, Johnson added.

“Active participation of academic medical centers in caring for non-whites and the poor prepares a more qualified and culturally competent generation of physicians and health care providers who will have more familiarity with the unique circumstances and barriers confronting these patients,” Johnson said.

https://www.kcet.org/shows/town-hall-los-angeles/las-growing-economic-gap-a-need-for-equity,['Los Angeles'],L.A.'s Growing Economic Gap: A Need For Equity,"Rising rents. Stagnant wages. Homelessness. Gentrification. Today's big stories in Los Angeles have a common thread: a gap in social and economic equity. How we solve these problems is a big question and one that can't be answered unless we understand how inequity has divided Los Angeles. That's where someone like Jennifer Ito comes into the picture.

Ito is the research director for the USC Program of Environmental and Regional Equity (PERE). She looks at the demographics-- all those numbers pertaining to the ethnic and economic make-up of a place-- and makes sense of them. She has co-authored studies, like ""Talkin' 'Bout Our Generations: Data Deliberation, and Destiny in a Changing America"" and ""Linking Innovation with Inclusion: Demography, Equity and the Future of San Diego.""

Jennifer Ito, PERE Director

More recently, at PERE, researchers have been looking at the demographic shifts in Los Angeles and how that's affected social and economic equity. ""An Equity Profile of the Los Angeles Region,"" funded by the Weingart Foundation and PolicyLink, breaks down the numbers and illustrates where the biggest gaps in equity are. Knowing this information can help shape the county's future.

What the profile found is enlightening and it often contradicts the perceptions that people have of Los Angeles. The summary of the ""Equity Profile"" explains that 73% of Los Angeles' population is comprised of people of color and that it will be majority Latino by 2020. But, what it also found was that the surge in population growth that happened in the 1980s hasn't continued to the present day.

Moreover, what the profile reports is that, in recent years, the population of Asian Angelenos has increased by 22% and more than half of that growth has been through immigration. Meanwhile, the Latino Angeleno population has increased by 13% and that's primarily people of Latino heritage who were born in the U.S. All other groups, the profile says, have had declining population in the Los Angeles area.

But, the profile doesn't just look at ethnic demographics. It looks at economic ones too and that's where some of the misconceptions about Los Angeles are revealed. In truth, the profile shows, job growth in Los Angeles has been lagging since 1979 and, since 1990, poverty has been higher than average here. In fact, the profile notes, Los Angeles was found to have the 7th highest level of income inequality in the country and the report states that 18.4% of locals live below the poverty line.

While there isn't just one cause for this, there is one that the report highlights: declining ""middle-wage jobs."" There's been a significant decline in available work at this level. Meanwhile, low and high wage jobs have increased. With that in mind, you can see why the divide between the rich and the poor is growing.

But, there's more to it than just the number of available jobs. The ""Equity Profile"" also crunches the data to show how social and economic inequality by race, is impacted by the local job market. The report shows not only that African-American and Latino residents are more likely to live below the poverty line-- and that Latinos are more likely to be considered ""working poor-- than white residents, but that employment opportunities and wages aren't necessarily increasing with education levels. Moreover, the profile notes that women of color are earning less regardless of their education level.

Ito and the researchers at PERE pull the data so that policymakers and other big thinkers can figure out a way to build a better future. This is bound to have an effect on someone like Marqueece Harris-Dawson. He's the Los Angeles City Councilmember for the 8th district, which covers South Los Angeles. Harris-Dawson is the author of Proposition HHH, the $1.2 billion bond to create housing for the homeless that passed in the November 2016 election. Equity is part of Harris-Dawson's platform. One of his projects is CD 8 Clean and Safe Streets, a program designed to make more use of city services for maintaining the streets in the neighborhood.

Marqueece Harris-Dawson, 8th District Councilmember

Last March, Harris Dawson was part of a panel at the Weingart Foundation's ""Achieving Equity"" event in Los Angeles. There, he spoke about L.A.'s past, where money often funneled into the wealthier parts of town, leaving low-income areas without key resources. That changed, he says. But, he added, that's not how equity is achieved because not every neighborhood needs the same amount of funding for the same purpose. Data, he notes, can help the powers that be figure out who needs what and that can make a huge different in how the city continues to develop. ""Equity is a value on the one hand,"" he told the crowd, ""but, on the other, it is a practice.""

Thanks to our sponsors: View all sponsors

Nationally, that figure is about 12 percent.

Those findings are among the many health disparities detailed in the Sinai Community Health Survey 2.0, which evaluated the health of more than 1,900 residents in nine Chicago neighborhoods.

Maureen Benjamins, senior researcher at Sinai Urban Health Institute, said that while the findings surprised many researchers involved in the survey, not everyone reacted similarly.

“The community health workers go into the field every day and go into people’s homes, and say these findings confirm what they already knew,” she said.

Researchers conducted face-to-face interviews with residents of Chicago Lawn, Gage Park, Hermosa, Humboldt Park, North Lawndale, Norwood Park, South Lawndale, West Englewood and parts of West Town, where residents west of Western Avenue were surveyed.

“The data paint a stark and complex picture of health and wellness in many Chicago communities, varied by race, income and ethnicity, demonstrating the value in collecting hyperlocal information,” said Sharon Homan, president of the Sinai Urban Health Institute, in a statement.

Drilling down to a community-level can reveal nuances in citywide health data, said Benjamins.

“The city [smoking] level is 18 percent, so about one in five people in Chicago smoke. In the selected communities that we surveyed, that rate ranges from 6 percent to nearly 60 percent,” Benjamins said.

In West Englewood, 56 percent of men and 47 percent of women smoke. “That would be an ideal place to focus our efforts” to reduce smoking by providing resources in the community, she said.

Residents were asked more than 500 questions that addressed traditional health measures such as general health status, obesity and post-traumatic stress disorder.

According to the survey, one in four women in Humboldt Park and North Lawndale currently have symptoms of PTSD, and at least one in 10 adults in Humboldt Park and the western side of West Town have been diagnosed with the disorder.

Jana Hirschtick, senior epidemiologist at Sinai Urban Health Institute, called the rates of PTSD “alarming.”

“We were aware that this was an issue but not aware of the magnitude,” she said.

Survey questions also touched on social factors that influence a person’s health, including food insecurity, criminal justice experiences and unmet health care needs.

Assessing social factors of health is “really critical, and unfortunately, overlooked when we think of traditional health measures,” said Hirschtick.

Social and behavioral factors have a larger impact on health than traditional measures, like clinical care, and shed light on differences in health between groups, she added. “It helps us understand and get to the why of why things are the way they are and why there are differences in groups.”

Many residents said that they forgo medical care, surgery, treatment, prescriptions and even eyeglasses due to costs. In Gage Park, one in six adults did not receive needed medical care or surgery in the past year due to the cost. Meanwhile, about one in four adults in West Englewood and North Lawndale did not get needed prescription medications in the past year because of cost.

Benjamins said she was surprised by the prevalence of food insecurity—or the limited availability or access to nutritionally adequate and safe foods—among those surveyed.

More than 40 percent of households in Humboldt Park, South Lawndale and Gage Park were food insecure in the past year, compared to 13 percent of homes nationally, according to the study.

Collecting the data and quantifying the experiences of residents are the first steps to creating meaningful programs and policies, says Hirschtick.

“There are a constellation of factors that communities face that impact their health. It’s not just PTSD, or food insecurity, or obesity,” she said. “Disadvantaged communities have a number of factors that impact people’s daily lives and health.

“Each community is really unique in terms of the constellation of factors and the different people in them,” she added. “And when we think of solutions and translating the findings into solutions we need to tackle them neighborhood by neighborhood.”

Next month, SUHI will begin hosting community forums to share the data with residents and start working with community partners to develop solutions.

“We’re really hoping with the public release of this data it will serve as a call to action for people. I think a lot of the findings demand attention,” Hirschtick said. “They were alarming to us even though people live them every day. We hope we can turn the findings into actionable results and we’re actively looking for partners to do so.”

https://news.wttw.com/2017/08/02/chicago-leads-nation-reducing-racial-disparity-breast-cancer-deaths,['Chicago'],Chicago Leads Nation in Reducing Racial Disparity in Breast Cancer Deaths,"For black women in Chicago, a breast cancer diagnosis in 2003 meant you were 68 percent more likely to die from the disease than a white woman. But roughly a decade earlier, there was no such disparity.

Public concern over the growing trend led to the creation of the Metropolitan Chicago Breast Cancer Task Force in 2008.

Thanks to our sponsors: View all sponsors

Anne Marie Murphy, executive director of the task force, said the growth of the mortality disparity was “alarming.” Community leaders, advocates, health care providers and breast cancer survivors who make up the task force have been working ever since to eliminate “inequities in prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment and survivorship of all women,” according to its mission statement.

After nine years, a new study finds the task force is having an impact: An analysis of data collected from 2006-2013 shows that African-American women diagnosed with breast cancer were 39 percent more likely to die from the disease than their white counterparts.

“Now that 68 percent has come down to 39 percent. That’s a huge difference,” said Murphy. “It’s a large drop and we’re delighted about that. Obviously, we haven’t gotten to zero like we’d like to get to, but the needle is finally moving in the right direction.”

The study compared nationwide breast cancer mortality rates with those in Chicago and nine other U.S. cities with populations of at least 500,000 and high numbers of African-American residents. Researchers compared figures for each city over two time periods: 1999-2005 and 2006-2013.

From 1999-2005, the mortality disparity increased annually by 3.9 percent in Chicago, according to the study. But the trend was reversed from 2006-2013, when it decreased annually by 3.1 percent.

“Chicago’s collaborative efforts have shown that health disparities are not inevitable,” Murphy said. “They are not immutable. They can be overcome and health equity can be achieved.”

“The changes we’ve seen are a reflection of the city’s commitment to addressing health disparity,” said Chicago Department of Public Health Commissioner Dr. Julie Morita. “I think anytime we embark on a new effort to address health disparities we are concerned whether or not they’ll be successful, which is why we’re committed to doing studies like this one. ... It’s critically important to monitor initiatives to make sure they’re making a difference.”

Mortality rates for breast cancer dropped nationally between 2006 and 2013, with greater declines for white women in all cities – except Chicago, where black women saw a decline of 13.8 percent, compared to 7.7 percent for white women.

“Chicago leads the nation in reducing breast cancer deaths for African-American women,” Murphy said “The task force is unique in that it took a comprehensive approach to this disparity. We really felt strongly one needed to do a comprehensive assessment and then take an evidence-based approach on the front end and gathered a lot data as to where the challenges are in Chicago.”

Chicago’s ‘Comprehensive’ Approach

The task force began its first project, the Chicago Breast Cancer Quality Consortium, with the mission of improving “patient safety and the quality of breast cancer screening and treatment by sharing data on quality measures for breast cancer screening and treatment and developing quality improvement projects based on analysis of this data.”

Based on the assessment of data collected from about 60 Chicago-area facilities and hospitals, the task force identified areas that could be improved within the health care delivery system, from diagnosis to treatment.

It found a wide variation in the quality of mammograms. “The notion that a mammogram is a mammogram is a mammogram is not true,” Murphy said. “Resources are unevenly divided. Black women were less likely to have their mammograms read by a breast imaging specialist. They are more likely to have their mammograms read by a generalist.”

In addition, the task force found a “fractured” health care system. “Women on the South Side have limited access to service facilities. They don’t have a good pathway for comprehensive care,” Murphy said.

“We had a very systematic approach for assessing breast health systems and found a lot of variation in regard to how resources are readily available to women in different areas,” she added. “For instance, if you’re affluent in Chicago, you have a 40-percent chance of being proximal (within a mile) to a breast imaging center of excellence. If you’re poor, there’s a 1 percent chance of being proximal to a breast imaging center of excellence.”

“Chicago leads the nation in reducing breast cancer deaths for African-American women.”

–Anne Marie Murphy

In its analysis, the task force also discovered that not all facilities have the ability to follow up with their patients. “A lot of safety net facilities don’t have a lot of phones, so they don’t have the funding for navigators to follow up with their patients to get them back to care,” Murphy said. “Those reminders and follow ups really matter.”

That need led to the development of the task force’s Beyond October and Extra Help, Extra Care navigation programs. Navigators help women schedule mammograms, remind them of upcoming appointments, help interpret results and help coordinate treatment if they’re diagnosed with cancer.

“We help women navigate the system because it’s often complicated,” Murphy said.

Through the Beyond October program, navigators help 1,500 women a year and reach 12,000 through outreach and educational programming, according to Murphy. (Women can fill out an application online to qualify for free mammogram screenings through the program.)

About 200 women are helped each year through the task force’s Extra Help, Extra Care program for those who receive abnormal mammogram results at a partnering facility or hospital.

“We’ve made $700,000 available to continue this type of work for free in African-American communities and making sure our navigation services are available if women have abnormal mammograms. It’s not enough to know you have cancer. It’s important for them to get the cure that they need,” Morita said. “We are funding a number of groups and the Metropolitan Chicago Breast Cancer Task Force is one of them.”

Other interventions initiated by the task force include educating the public about the importance of breast cancer screenings, training technologists how to properly take and read mammograms, and conducting on-site assessments of facilities to close any gaps in diagnosis or treatment.

“We’ve done a lot of these interventions. Some have been very successful,” Murphy said. “We think it’s a wonderful model for other locations because it’s something that definitely can be replicated.”

https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/health/article/Survey-Houston-far-from-a-picture-of-health-14449393.php,['Houston'],Survey says Houston’s health is fair to poor,"One in five Harris County residents rate their health as poor or fair, double the U.S. average and no better than nearly a decade ago, according to a University of Texas survey

The survey, which provides a snapshot of health disparities across 38 county communities, found the worst health assessments in Aldine, Settegast, Edgebrook, Gulfton and South Acres, all economically depressed areas. The percentage of respondents rating their health as poor or fair ranged from 28 in South Acres to 45 in Aldine.

“We can’t seem to improve a base of people’s health, even though we’ve strengthened the area’s safety-net health clinics in the last decade,” said Stephen Linder, the survey’s principal investigator and director of the Institute for Health Policy at the UTHealth School of Public Health. “If we hadn’t strengthened the safety net, it would be even worse.”

Obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes were the most chronic health problems affecting county residents. Thirty-two percent meet the definition for obesity, 29 percent suffer from hypertension and 13 percent have diabetes, numbers that mask even higher rates in the disadvantaged areas. Gulfton’s rate of diabetes was 21 percent, for instance, up from 15 percent in 2010.

Nineteen percent of respondents said they “sometimes” had trouble just getting food in the last 12 months. More than 10 percent of black residents encountered such difficultly “regularly” and a quarter of both blacks and Hispanics encountered it “sometimes.”

Ken Janda, a former Houston insurance company CEO who is now a consulting firm principal, said the report “highlights something that should be obvious — health outcomes are strongly correlated with income. In order to improve the overall health of Texas and Houston in particular we have to improve access to healthy environments, activities and care for low-income populations.”

Linder began presenting survey findings to local health officials and community groups last month. A report on the survey, based on 2017 and 2018 telephone interviews in English and Spanish with 5,694 Harris County households, can be accessed online at www.healthofhouston.org.

On HoustonChronicle.com: Do you live in one of Houston’s many food deserts?

Dr. Umair Shah, executive director of Harris County Public Health, praised the report for “highlighting where things are happening” and said it will allow the sprawling county to “pinpoint interventions in areas most in need.” He said the report “really paints a picture that we have to do more to address problems at the community level.”

The survey builds on a similar one Linder conducted in the Houston area in 2010, which pioneered the concept of gathering and analyzing data at the sub-county level, now increasingly being employed around the state and nation. Previously, the only sub-national and sub-state data was collected at the county level, which Shah emphasized isn’t “always that helpful in one with 4.7 million people and the size of Rhode Island.”

‘The hard part is not knowing’

Among those in the county battling health issues is Sister Mama Sonya, whose doctors are struggling to determine the cause of abdominal pain that wasn’t relieved by the removal earlier this year of a benign tumor near her pancreas. She has fibroids, but doctors don’t think that’s the issue.

“The hard part is not knowing what the condition is,” says Sonya, 63, who lives in the Third Ward, where nearly 1 in 4 people rate their health as poor or fair. “I just want to know what it is, how to treat it.”

Sonya, who used to consume lots of sugar and fast food but no longer does, also battles diabetes and the accompanying nerve pain in the extremities, which exacerbates the clinical depression she was diagnosed with years ago. She founded Sisters Controlling Diabetes, a support group for women of color with the condition, and wrote a book, “Sweet Sensations for the Spirit,” a collection of conversations with diabetes patients.

She lost her insurance recently when she was laid off, but receives treatment through the Harris Health System, the county’s safety-net hospital system.

In fact, thanks to the Affordable Care Act, fewer Harris County residents are uninsured now — 27 percent of adults, down from to 31 percent in 2010; and 11 percent of children, down from 13 percent. Forty percent have no dental insurance, compared to 49 percent in 2010.

But closer analysis revealed continued cracks.

Fifty-six percent of Hispanics were uninsured, four times the rate of whites and roughly three times that of blacks and Asians. Linder said the primary reason for that is Hispanics disproportionately work in service industries, construction trades and small firms that provide no insurance to their employees. Undocumented Hispanics accounted for about six precent of the total.

Geographically, rates varied from 7 percent to 56 percent, with the highest amounts in Pasadena, Galena Park, Gulton, Aldine and a southwest Houston area that includes part of Bellaire. The latter two had the highest percentage of residents both uninsured and unable to get needed care.

In Gulfton, lacking insurance, Diana Lopez would try to push through teeth pain, headaches and high blood pressure.

“I’d faint sometimes, never sure why,” says Lopez, who has matters under control now thanks to a local clinic that provides low-cost care, including sliding-scale rates. “And I’d bear any pain, try to blow it off, take over-the-counter medication. I just didn’t have the money for insurance.”

On HoustonChronicle.com: Census: Texas again leads nation in uninsured — by huge margin

Even the big-picture insurance improvement was underwhelming to Dr. David Persse, the city of Houston health department’s health authority. Noting the “thousands of hours of effort” by the health department to facilitate people signing up for coverage, he said “the all too small improvement” was his biggest disappointment from the survey.

“This hurts everyone,” said Persse. “Caring for persons without insurance still spends healthcare dollars, but in the most inefficient and ineffective ways. In addition, these inefficiencies serve to slow down the system as well as increase costs for all persons seeking health care regardless of their insurance status.”

Persse added that the lack of insurance has contributed to nights this summer when the majority of emergency centers across Houston have requested ambulance traffic be diverted elsewhere, “unusual for this time of year.” That’s only likely to worsen during the coming flu season, he noted.

Some positive numbers

There were some improvements since 2010: the percentage of mothers who’ve ever breastfed rose from 82 to 89; the percentage of adults who met the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for physical activity rose from 47 to 59; the percentage of pregnant women receiving prenatal care in the first trimester rose from 84 to 92; and cancer screening rates improved — from 72 percent to 80 percent for breast cancer.

The county’s HPV vaccination rate was also a positive. Forty-one percent of Harris County adolescents — 47 percent of girls and 35 percent of boys — had received the full complement of shots. That’s higher than the state — 38 percent overall, including 42 percent of girls and 34 percent of boys. The issue was not on the 2010 survey.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.

A new study bolsters evidence that soda taxes can reduce sales, but whether they influence health remains unclear.

The research found that Philadelphia's 2017 tax led to a 38 percent decline in sugary soda and diet drink sales that year, even when taking into account an increase in sales in neighboring towns.

The results echo previous studies in Philadelphia, Berkeley and other places that have imposed beverage taxes, although the sales decline was larger than in some previous research. Unlike studies in Berkeley and Mexico, nontaxed drink sales didn't increase during the study, ""suggesting consumers were not substituting with these drinks in Philadelphia,"" the researchers said.

The new results were published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association. Bloomberg Philanthropies, a charitable group that supports anti-obesity measures including soda taxes, paid for the study but otherwise had no role in the research.

While Americans' soda intake has declined in recent years, physician groups including the AMA support soda taxes as a way to combat obesity. The beverage industry and many merchants have fought back, with court cases and ballot initiatives, with mixed success. Last year, Pennsylvania's highest court upheld Philadelphia's tax, which is levied on distributors.

Philadelphia's tax has generated more than $130 million that's paying for free preschool programs and other community services. The study has no data on beverage consumption or obesity rates, but lead author Dr. Christina Roberto of the University of Pennsylvania says the sales decline suggests Philadelphians are drinking less soda and is a promising sign.

""I think it's well on its way to accomplishing its goal"" of funding preschool programs and other city projects, said Roberto, an assistant professor of medical ethics and health policy. ""It has this side benefit of reducing purchasing of these unhealthy drinks. It's win-win news for public health.""

The new results are based on sales at nearly 300 supermarkets, big box stores and pharmacies in Philadelphia and its Pennsylvania suburbs. The researchers also looked at Baltimore, which doesn't have a soda tax, for comparison purposes.

They tracked sales starting in January 2016, the year before the 1.5-cents-per-ounce tax was imposed, through December 2017. Per-ounce soda prices in Philadelphia increased by 1.56 cents at pharmacies, .87 cents at big box stories, and .65 cents at supermarkets. Sales volume decreased by 1.3 billion ounces in Philadelphia, or about 50 percent, but that dropped to 38 percent when counting a 308 million-per-ounce sales volume increase in bordering communities, where prices were nearly unchanged. Soda sales prices edged up and soda sales volume dipped slightly in Baltimore.

Despite uncertainty over the potential health benefits, a journal editorial says there's enough supporting evidence ""to move forward with adoption of taxes while continuing to monitor outcomes."" The editorial authors include Dr. James Krieger, a public health physician and executive director of Healthy Food America, an advocacy group that supports soda taxes and other measures aimed at curbing America's junk food habit.

William Dermody, a spokesman for the American Beverage Association, said the study conflicts with other evidence suggesting a bigger effect from cross-border shopping for untaxed drinks outside of Philadelphia. U.S. drink-makers are reducing sugar in their products and creating smaller bottles and cans — steps he said make more sense than taxes to help Americans cut their sugar intake.

Local and statewide officials in the Greater Houston area are working to reduce childhood obesity—a condition that could add billions to health care costs and affect the health of this generation of children as they become adults.

About 34 percent of children 12 or older are considered at an unhealthy weight in the Greater Houston area, according to a survey by the University of Texas Public Health.

The high obesity rate has led to a rise in children with adult diseases, such as high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol and joint pains, said Ann Barnes, chief medical officer at Legacy Community Health. Legacy is a network of full-service clinics across the Greater Houston area.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention classifies people as overweight if their body mass index—a calculation based on an individual’s height and weight—is between the 85th and 95th percentiles. A person whose BMI is above the 95th percentile is considered obese.

Harris County officials are also looking for ways address the childhood obesity in low-income communities.

While poor food choices and sedentary behavior are some of the primary contributors to childhood obesity, in lower socioeconomic areas, obesity has also been linked to food deserts, which are areas where a large number of residents are not within walking distance of a full-service grocery store, Barnes said.

When combined with a lack of transportation options, some parents in low-income areas are forced to purchase their groceries from gas stations and drug stores, Barnes said. The areas usually also feature a high density of fast-food restaurants, she said. About 16 percent of Greater Houston area residents do not have access to fruits and vegetables, according to the survey by the UTPH.

“If a neighborhood doesn’t have easy access to a full-service grocery store or a farmers market, families have less access to foods that would promote healthy eating,” Barnes said.

Harris County is trying to solve childhood obesity by creating public-private partnerships like Healthy Living Matters that lobby for government support and purchasing green space for parks and trails that will allow for a encourage more active lifestyles.

“You have to rely on people to take the initiative on their own families and households,” Umair Shah, executive director for Harris County Public Health.“But ... a family doesn’t make the decision to build a park near their home.”

But the crowded urban center of the nation’s fifth-largest city lacked a grocery store for residents and visitors.

The 8 a.m. grand opening of a Fry’s Food and Drug Store on Wednesday will mean downtown now longer will be a food desert for residents living within a 1-mile radius.

Food deserts in Arizona number about 700,000, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates. Downtown residents waited decades for grocery store, even as older cities like Detroit and Dallas have downtown groceries alongside restaurants, dry cleaners, shops and other small businesses.

Ashley Oakes, who lives, works and attends school in downtown Phoenix, said the new grocery store at First and Jefferson streets will be convenient because it’s two blocks away from her job, apartment and Arizona State University’s downtown campus.

It also will reduce the environmental impact for downtown residents, she said.

“It’ll make residents who live down here be able to go shopping and be able to not take their car to go shopping,” Oakes said. “They can have a granny cart, go use their reusable shopping bags, and it’ll save time on traffic.”

Alana Rhone, an agricultural economist for the USDA, said in an email that Arizona ranks 14th in the nation for the highest number of census tracts that are low income and have low access to healthful, affordable food.

Three of those areas cover downtown Phoenix, Rhone said.

Chris Berryman, who will manage the downtown Fry’s, said the store means people in the area don’t have to grocery shop at a convenience store.

“It will cater to all parts of the neighborhood – the lower incomes, the upper incomes, the encompassing entire area will be able to utilize this grocery store,” he said.

The nearest full-service grocery store to downtown is Safeway near Seventh Street and McDowell Road.

Berryman said that the new store will bring the area out of a food desert, which the nonprofit group Downtown Phoenix celebrated in a tweet:

Food advocacy experts say living in a food desert increases the likelihood of obesity, diabetes and heart disease.

Distance from a grocery store and access to a car determine a food desert, according to the USDA website. The government calls it LILA – low-income residents coupled with low-access, or distance from a store. The formula is different for urban and rural areas.

Arizona still has a number of food deserts.

In Glendale, 5.6% of residents live in a food desert, according to the USDA. In one area from 83rd to 59th avenues, it has seven gas stations, four small markets that include a carniceria and an African market, a convenience store and a Walgreens – none a full-service grocery store selling fresh produce. Three Walmarts are the nearest stores.

But Chandler, according to the USDA, has plenty of grocery stores. It has two food deserts, affecting about 0.002 of households. Still, that’s more than 9,000 residents.

REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton

NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City has launched a $100 million health insurance program to cover 600,000 uninsured residents, including those unable to afford coverage and those living in the United States illegally, Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Tuesday.

De Blasio, now in his second term as mayor of the country’s most populous city, has long supported universal healthcare coverage. Extending the program to an estimated 300,000 illegal immigrants puts the Democrat at odds with U.S. President Donald Trump, who has made border security a top priority for his presidency.

“No one should have to live in fear. No one should go without the health care they need. Health care is a human right. In this city, we’re gonna make that a reality,” de Blasio said during a news conference. “From this moment on in New York City, everyone is guaranteed the right to health care.”

Healthcare coverage has become a highly partisan issue in the United States. Trump’s Republican party has pushed to repeal the 2010 Obamacare program, which expanded health care to most uninsured Americans, while the liberal wing of the Democratic party has called for a federally funded, single-payer system, inspired by programs in Canada and many European countries.

The NYC Care plan, which de Blasio said would be funded without tax increases, is an expansion of the city’s existing MetroPlus plan that covers hospital bills for low-income residents. The new plan provides insurance for visits to doctors outside of hospitals. Health experts say that access to regular medical visits can cut down on costly hospital stays.

NYC Care, which will be launched in the Bronx borough in the summer of 2019, will expand across the entire city by 2021 and cost at least $100 million annually, according to a statement from the mayor’s office.

The mayor said all services would be affordable on a sliding scale for those who are able to pay a portion of the costs, while those who cannot afford to pay will receive care for free.

Unlike the MetroPlus plan, NYC Care is a program that leverages the city’s hospital system. It provides no health coverage for residents traveling outside of the city, officials said at the news conference.",[]

A WELL community functions to promote health and well-being across all aspects of community life.

The evolution of the WELL Community Standard benefitted from expertise provided by several notable community-level projects, including Water Street Tampa, which helped inspire the creation of the standard in September 2015 when SPP, the Tampa-based real estate development firm behind Water Street Tampa, joined President Bill Clinton at the Clinton Global Initiative to make a commitment towards integrating wellness and sustainability into the all the places and spaces where we spend our time.

""Throughout the planning and design for Water Street Tampa, our team has been inspired by the vision behind the development of the WELL Community Standard, and we are incredibly proud to help pioneer this movement,"" said James Nozar, CEO of SPP. ""With the WELL D&O designation, we have achieved a milestone, and will continue to challenge the status quo in how wellness can be integrated into our neighborhood development and overall planning, design and operating processes. With the support of IWBI, we believe that Water Street Tampa has already proven to be a model for international learning in best practices.""

First introduced in 2017, the neighborhood-wide certification recognizes and honors neighborhoods – like Water Street Tampa – that implement design and policy strategies meant to improve the lives of their residents through the concepts of Air, Water, Nourishment, Light, Fitness, Sound, Mind, Temperature, Materials and Community. The WELL D&O milestone includes a review of the work already completed and validates the progress towards achieving certification.

Honoring its commitment to building, promoting and ensuring a comprehensive well-being at Water Street Tampa and fulfilling WELL Certification, SPP is employing various wellness- and community-focused measures throughout the neighborhood.

These initiatives include improving walkability, with sidewalk widths ranging from 14 to 45 feet, exceeding the City of Tampa's requirements; comfortably-scaled building block sizes to promote pedestrian connectivity and an engaging ground-level experience; diverse activity programming such as yoga in the park to facilitate opportunities for physical activity; publicly accessible air quality monitoring data; filtered water bottle refilling stations to promote drinking water for overall improved health; curfew hours for public realm lighting to be dimmed where applicable, reducing light pollution; urban heat island mitigation through light-colored pavement and tree-canopy shaded sidewalks; urban water features, such as fountains, to moderate microclimate temperatures; recycling available throughout the public realm and in every building; celebration of place through native landscape, reinforcing local identity; increased digital connectivity with free public WiFi; a comprehensive public art and culture plan that intends to enhance civic pride and engagement; a publicly accessible community wellness center, as a neighborhood gathering place, with a demonstration kitchen that will be programmed with regular chef-led classes that will provide education on healthy cooking options; and an emphasis on providing access to fresh foods with a full-service neighborhood grocer to be located at 815 Water Street, in addition to regular neighborhood farmer's markets.

""Across the globe, our communities are more than just where we live,"" said IWBI Chairman and CEO Rick Fedrizzi. ""Our communities represent our culture, connect us with each other and help keep us safe. With this leading achievement, Water Street Tampa is at the cutting edge of this critical movement for communities by enhancing health and quality of life at scale.""

The vision for Water Street Tampa revolves around the philosophy that thoughtfully designed buildings are only as good as the spaces between them. Designed by Reed Hilderbrand , a Cambridge-based landscape architecture firm that serves as the master landscape architect, and master planner Elkus Manfredi Architects , a renowned Boston-based global firm, the vibrant waterfront neighborhood will feature public spaces designed to improve the health and wellbeing of those visiting, living and working within the neighborhood.

Existing spaces such as Cotanchobee Park along the Garrison Channel waterfront, Thunder Plaza in front of Amalie Arena and the Tampa Riverwalk will be joined by new spaces, such as a rooftop lounge and terrace at the JW Marriott, a public plaza at the entrance of the USF Morsani College of Medicine and Heart Institute designed by renowned firm Nelson Byrd Woltz and a new public park planned at the intersection of Cumberland Avenue and Water Street, offering diversity of experiences, with sidewalk cafes, unique food and retail kiosks and spaces for programmed events and community gatherings.

In addition to becoming the world's first community to reach the WELL D&O milestone, Water Street Tampa also intends to be LEED Neighborhood Development (ND) certified, which was created to shape more sustainable and well-connected neighborhoods.

The CDC’s 500 Cities project, which tracks health-related data at the city level, shows Boulder, Centennial and Fort Collins are among the top five cities in the country with the lowest percentage of residents who don’t get any kind of physical activity during their free time.

Boulder in particular has the lowest percentage nationwide at 10.8 percent. That means 89.1 percent of all adults in Boulder get some kind of exercise outside of work or school.

The dataset doesn’t include any information on how much activity people are getting on average, so it’s hard to say whether Boulder residents actually spend more time being active. All the data tell us is that the city’s inhabitants as a whole are more likely to spend their free time doing something physically active.

Overall, Western states tend to have the lowest rates of inactivity, with Colorado, Washington and California making up eight of the top 10 cities with the lowest percentages.

Here’s how the rest of Colorado fares (Percentage of adults with no leisure-time physical activity in parentheses):

1. Boulder (10.8%)

2. Centennial (12.6%)

If you want to know how things went, I’m planning to post about it on Twitter and Instagram right after the race. Then I’ll have a full write up about our race experience in next week’s newsletter. As much as I’ll want to write about it right away, I know that when I’m done I will want a shower, a cheeseburger and a Bloody Mary (and then maybe a second), so your patience is appreciated.

Our Sports section will keep you updated with other coverage.

Run Well!

The researchers report in the journal Nature Nov. 15 that Houston's risk for extreme flooding during the hurricane -- a category 4 storm that caused an estimated $125 billion in damage and killed 68 people -- was 21 times greater due to urbanization.

Using computer models and weather data, the researchers recreated Hurricane Harvey and compared the total rainfall with urban buildup to total rainfall without urban buildup. The results indicate that human-made development helped create a wetter hurricane -- one that dropped 40 to 60 inches of rain over four days -- as well as more serious flooding, with higher flood peaks and greater overall damage.

The results highlight the human role in extreme weather events, as well as the need to consider urban and suburban development when calculating hurricane risk and preparing for hurricane damage and recovery, the authors said. The study also accentuates the need to understand the compounded human impact on rainfall and flooding caused by urbanization and climate change.

""Our focus on the role of urbanization was aimed at providing a fuller perspective of human activities on Harvey's rainfall and flooding,"" said co-author Gabriel Vecchi, a Princeton professor of geosciences and the Princeton Environmental Institute (PEI). ""Humans have influenced both climate, through greenhouse gas emissions, and the local environment around Houston through urbanization in ways that we thought could have affected rainfall and flooding from Harvey.""

The researchers found that as Houston's urban center grew upward and outward, flood risk changed, including a greater risk of higher flood peaks and more serious and dangerous flooding overall. As the city's miles of impervious sidewalks and streets increased, heavy rainfall could not be absorbed into the ground.

""Given that hurricane winds and rainfall are projected to intensify in the future, and that urbanization along our coasts is also expected to continue to increase, our work highlights the need to understand the risks and to implement appropriate flood-mitigation strategies,"" said lead author Wei Zhang, an assistant research scientist at Iowa's IIHR -- Hydroscience and Engineering research center.

Much of the scientific analysis that followed the 2017 hurricane season focused on the role of climate -- including the overall warming of the planet -- in determining a hurricane's physical strength and total amount of rainfall. The Princeton and Iowa researchers decided to take a different, but complementary, tack and looked at urbanization's possible role.

""Hurricane Havey's impacts on Houston highlight hazards to coastal cities along the Gulf Coast and Eastern Seaboard of the United States,"" said co-author James Smith, a Princeton professor of civil and environmental engineering and PEI associated faculty. ""An unfortunate repeat performance from Hurricane Florence this year underscores the problems of extreme tropical cyclone rainfall in urban settings.""

The researchers experimented with different computer models to simulate Hurricane Harvey's rainfall in Houston, first looking at total rainfall with the city's current urban profile, then at rainfall for the same geographic area but with open fields and crops in place of streets and skyscrapers. They found that the non-urban areas received significantly less rainfall, and that rainfall patterns were significantly different than in the urban areas.

The reason was that ""surface roughness"" due to the presence of human-made structures create a ""drag effect"" on hurricanes. This effect occurs when high winds strike tall buildings, creating friction. In the case of Hurricane Harvey, winds shifted warm surface air farther up into the atmosphere, thereby creating an optimal situation for cloud formation and precipitation.

""When Hurricane Harvey blew into Houston, it literally got snagged on the city's tall skyscrapers and towers,"" said Gabriele Villarini, associate professor of civil and environmental engineering and director of IIHR. ""The friction caused by high winds buffeting tall buildings created a drag effect that influenced air and heat movement and resulted in optimal conditions for precipitation.""

Using statistical models, the researchers also looked at year-over-year changes in flood peaks and compared them to rainfall amounts and population growth, a proxy for urbanization. They compared these results to flood peaks from the 1950s, a period that predates urban development in Houston, and again found a positive correlation between urban growth and increased flood risk.

""Urbanization is generally associated with a significant reduction in storm-water infiltration,"" Villarini said. ""Houston has experienced one of the most impressive urban-development booms in U.S. history, and with growth comes an increase in impervious surfaces. This increase in urbanization, combined with the region's flat clay terrain, represents a very problematic mix, even with flood-mitigation measures in place.""

The researchers caution that failure to account for urban factors in terms of hurricane preparation could present serious and costly problems for coastal cities.

""While this research can't be extrapolated to every coastal urban area in the nation, it does highlight the unexpected costs of development,"" Villarini said. ""For every new roadway poured and for every new high-rise erected, there is an increased risk for more adverse rainfall and flooding, and that's certainly something that city officials and residents should consider when they contemplate future growth.""",[]

Thursday is Bike to Work Day in the Bay Area, and though you still can't fulfill the ultimate dream of biking across the Bay Bridge, it's a good day to be a bike commuter.

The San Francisco Bicycle Coalition is organizing ""energizer stations"" for cyclists to get free snacks and drinks, bike check-ups, and more. There will also be ""commuter convoys"" leaving from various spots in the city. Check the coalition's site for more events and info.

Business Insider took a look at some of the main reasons to bike to work every day, not just Thursday. Check them out, and check out some of our favorite crazy bikes in the gallery above.

Resolving to save money, get healthy, or cut your carbon footprint? You could hit all three by simply riding your bike to work.

Not only does biking have the potential to improve individuals' health, wealth, and standard of living, but the combination of more cyclists and fewer cars on the road could give the entire country a much-needed boost.

Here are 13 reasons you should consider making biking to work a new habit in the new year:

It would make cycling safer for everyone.

Research shows that unlike cars, the more bicycles on the road, the safer it becomes for cyclists.

""It's a virtuous cycle,"" Dr. Julie Hatfield, an injury expert from the University of New South Wales, says. ""The likelihood that an individual cyclist will be struck by a motorist falls with increasing rate of bicycling in a community. And the safer cycling is perceived to be, the more people are prepared to cycle.""

It is vastly cheaper than driving.

Due to rising fuel costs and tire upkeep, the cost of owning a car increased nearly 2% in 2012 to $8,946, according to AAA.

It costs just $308 per year to keep bikes in shape — nearly 30 times less than cars, according to the Sierra Club. It says: ""If American drivers were to make just one four-mile round trip each week with a bicycle instead of a car, they would save nearly 2 billion gallons of gas. At $4 per gallon, total savings would be $7.3 billion a year.""

It's a free gym on wheels.

On average, bicycle commuters lose 13 pounds in their first year of cycling alone.

""[Bike commuting] can be a very effective cardiovascular benefit,"" says Lisa Callahan, MD, of the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City. ""If you're overweight and start an exercise program, sometimes it's harder on your joints because you are overweight, so something like swimming or biking that's not pounding on the joints can be a good thing.""

You won't miss morning traffic jams.

Americans spend upwards of 25 minutes per day commuting to work and more than $700 per year simply burning fumes in traffic

Cycling could help you get there faster for a lot less.

""Half of the working population in the U.S. commutes five miles or less to work, with bike trips of three to five miles taking less time or the same amount of time as commuting by car,"" writes Kiplinger editor Amanda Lilly.

You don't even have to own a bike.

There's been a wave of new bike share programs in major cities like Washington, D.C., Boston, Chicago, and Miami, which typically allow riders 30 to 45 minutes of transportation for a small annual fee.

When New York City's bike share launched in May, annual memberships cost $95 — about $10 less than subway commuters spend per month.

Women could use the extra bone support.

As women age, they become increasingly susceptible to bone deterioration through osteoporosis.

A team of researchers from a Swedish university found middle-aged women were less likely to sustain wrist fractures if they commuted by bike or participated in other physical activities like walking.

We could save hundreds of millions on health care expenses.

""The most important socio-economic impact of cycling lies in the area of health care,"" says Andy Clarke, president of the League of American Bicyclists.

Nowhere is that more clear than in Portland, Ore. A study published in the Journal of Physical Activity and Health found that ""during the next 30 years, Portland’s residents could save as much as $594 million in health care costs because of an investment into biking culture"" and ""fuel savings of $143 to $218 million.""

You inhale more harmful exhaust in your car than on a bike.

Though fuel emissions are bad news in general, drivers are actually more susceptible to harmful air than bicyclists.

""Studies show you get the biggest hit of the nasties when you’re inside a car,"" notes the Grist's Umbra Frisk. ""Sure, a personal Mobile Emissions Source [cars, for example] appears hermetic, but it’s an illusion: MES occupants are very close to sucking on the tailpipe of the MES just ahead of them. In a bus, riders’ lungs are a bit above these sources. And bikers and pedestrians are on the outskirts.""

You're way more likely to get sick taking public transportation.

Fresh air does a body good. A study by the University of Nottingham found that public transit riders were ""six times more likely to suffer from acute respiratory infections,"" the New York Daily News reports.

Supposedly, occasional riders were even more at risk. Another study found a host of illness-causing viruses lurking in passenger vehicles, including E. coli, salmonella, and campylobacter, according to Safetyissues.com.

Businesses will save millions in lost productivity.

A recent study by Dutch economic think tank TNO found people who commuted to work by bike were less likely to call in sick.

""Commuting to work by bicycle by just 1% could save [Denmark’s] employers approximately $34 million in lost productivity from absenteeism,"" Oregon state rep. Earl Blumenhauer writes in American Bicyclist. ""That’s assuming a workforce of 7.1 million people. The U.S. has more than 154 million people in its workforce.""

Uncle Sam will pay you to bike to work.

Since January 2012, cyclist commuters have been entitled to a $20 per month tax-free reimbursement for bike-related expenses.

This applies to workers who bike at least three days per week to the office. Qualifying expenses include bike repairs and storage expenses, according to the National Center for Transit Research.

You'll never have to worry about a parking spot again.

Hundreds of major companies have entered the American League of Bicyclists' ""Bicycle Friendly Business"" program, and cities like New York require commercial office buildings by law to offer some sort of bike storage.

Otherwise, invest in a sturdy bike lock, and all you need is a spare bike rack or street sign to park your ride. Folding bikes are another useful option, as they can be packed into a bag and stashed easily under a desk or a closet.

Because all of your excuses not to bike are lame.

We get it. Biking makes you sweat. Cab drivers are tyrants. You could smack into a car door and knock yourself out.

But hear us out. Start slowly. Buy a sturdy helmet, throw a change of clothes into your basket, or, better yet, leave some at the office. Research the safest bike route to take (Google Maps offers biking directions in most cities), and read up on the rules of the road for cyclists.

Like any form of new exercise, chances are you'll need time to get in a good groove with your two-wheeled commute. Once you do, trust us — you'll be hooked.",[]
